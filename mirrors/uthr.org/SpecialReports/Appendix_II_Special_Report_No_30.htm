<h1>Trincomalee Where What Seems is Not Quite</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In Trincomalee District where the three communities live
together and deal with each other, a form of governance dedicated to equality
and fair-play would have helped them to find their balance. Their economic life
for example is interdependent. Soon after the December 2004 tsunami there was a
manifestation of spontaneous unity and mutual sympathy. These relations have
suffered both by governments intent on pushing Sinhalisation as well as the
spur this provided for the growth of a countervailing Tamil extremist force –
the LTTE. The present government has shown a strong tendency to use the slogan
‘fight against terror’ to crush the minorities and push for Sinhalisation
aggressively.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>While the conflict has perverted relationships and
concentrated power in a few players leaving the people out in the cold, the
fact that the three communities are culturally very close has also factored
into these relationships. Because of this inherent closeness, tragedies too
became poignant during outbreaks of violence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Until July 1987 Tamils were at the receiving end of violence
by the security forces when a large number of Tamil houses and premises were
destroyed and scores were killed. Soon after the Indo-Lanka Accord, in
September 1987, a Tamil mob, which also included Tamils released from detention
under the PTA, went on the rampage in Trincomalee against the Sinhalese.
Special Report No.8 gives a scene whose poignancy is enhanced because the two
communities are far from being strangers:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“<i>An old [Sinhalese] man who went to a Tamil house to
purchase milk for his grand-daughter when confronted by Tamil hoodlums pleaded
for his life from the lady of the house. She was unable to stop them chasing
the man and beating him to death</i>.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Under the perverting influence of conflict, inter-communal
cooperation tends to show up in criminal activity and in the deplorable
activities of intelligence agencies rather than in healthier activities that
promote goodwill. This made Trincomalee a place where what seems is not quite
what is.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Sakthy Festival 2000:</b> On 12<sup>th</sup> April 2000,
Sakthy TV organized a New Year Tamil music festival at McHeyzer Stadium
Trincomalee. A bomb was thrown at the back of the stage 10 minutes before the
concert, killing eight, including a policeman and injuring scores. In the dark
the bomb thrower was seen getting away. The universal opinion among Tamils was
that the bomb was the work of Sinhalese extremist elements among the security
forces who could not stand any assertion of Tamilness in Trincomalee. The fact
that the bomber was not apprehended added to this suspicion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was recently that we received the testimony of a
bodyguard of Paduman, the former LTTE leader for Trincomalee, now in
Switzerland. He said that Ruban (an LTTE political leader now dead) paid Rs.
2000 to the Sinhalese underworld element Ice Manju to throw the bomb at the music
festival. Ice Manju whose father used to break ice for packing at the
Trincomalee fish market managed to operate keeping links with both the LTTE and
the security forces. One could name a number of Sinhalese businessmen in
Trincomalee who functioned in this manner. It was realpolitik.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The LTTE had business dealings with Chooty Mudalali, whom it
gave fishing rights in Pudawaikkattu, Kuchchaveli and areas to the north of
these. A Sinhalese underworld element Kapila used to attack Chooty as pro-LTTE.
Ice Manju shot Kapila in the fish market during the CFA guarded by four members
of the LTTE. Manju also acted as an informant to army intelligence, which the
LTTE used to lure Colonel Meedin of army intelligence and kill him in October
2005. Manju is now believed to be with the LTTE. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Both sides are guilty of actions calculated to spread misery
and keep tensions high in Trincomalee. The bomb at the music festival
illustrates the brand of politics advanced by the LTTE. Such actions were a way
of fostering the ferment of extreme Tamil nationalism among the young, greatly
aided by the constant threat of Sinhalisation pushed by several governments and
the security forces.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Many Tamils understood that extreme nationalism is
disastrous. The LTTE constantly countered such voices. One was its notable
assassination of the moderate Tamil MP A. Thangathurai on 5<sup>th</sup> July
1997. Even among the young it allowed no room for alternative views and it used
persons in civilian life to spy and do its dirty work. Pakkiyanathan Vijayashanthan
(Vijayan) was a young activist who on Human Rights Day in December 2000 spoke
at a meeting making a plea for Tamils to accommodate Muslim aspirations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A few days later, <i>Thandaham</i>, an NGO in Valaichenai
brought fisher folk for an outing in Trincomalee hosted by local fisher folk.
Some who wanted to see Koneswaram Temple from the sea were taken in a fishing
boat. Three of those in the boat, who were pro-LTTE nationalists pushed Vijayan
into the sea and did nothing to rescue him. Some who saw it some way off rushed
there in their boat and pulled him out. Those who pushed him in simply said
that they wanted to see if Vijayan could swim!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>While the LTTE attempts to manipulate the political space in
Trincomalee, Tamils had also to rely on the goodwill of some influential
Sinhalese to negotiate life in an environment dominated by Sinhalese security
forces. Albert Hendrik Weerakody of Orr’s Hill, a largely Tamil neighbourhood,
was one such person to whom Tamils turned.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Opinions among Tamils about Weerakody vary. Some credit him
with being a good man who stopped attacks against Tamils after 1985. Some felt
he was communal minded but they could not live in Orr’s Hill without him.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Whenever people had problems with the security
forces regarding for instance arrests, they went to Weerakody and he helped.
The LTTE in mid-October 2005 inexplicably began killing a number of Sinhalese
businessmen.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=postbody><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>In
the normal vein of its politics the LTTE wanted to heighten tensions in
Trincomalee. On the other side there was a new government dominated by
Sinhalese extremists who wanted to teach the Tamils a lesson. We have no doubt
that the incident where the Five Students were killed was planned with a
vindictive purpose with the full force of the Defence Ministry behind it, with
all arms of the security forces ordered to cooperate with the Police that was
executing it (Special Report No.24). <o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=postbody><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=postbody><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>As
to why the beach was chosen for exhibition murders, it was a place the young
gathered in the evenings and the friends who were targeted were also there
regularly. We have also pointed out that the LTTE moved aggressively to control
all the openings for political discussion and opinion. Wherever the young
gathered, the LTTE was there in some form canvassing support for its
destructive politics. For this reason many parents discouraged their children
from going to meeting points. With the extremist drift of politics in the
South, many, or even most, young Tamils are bound to accept LTTE propaganda
about the plight of the Tamils uncritically and that is not their fault. <o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=postbody><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A student who was present at the scene who was two years
senior to the five boys killed. For his own sake his testimony must be obtained
and the matter cleared. We will refer to this student as S. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>*About 5.00 PM on 1<sup>st</sup> January, S with the circle
of boys that included the victims were eating at Kumar’s restaurant that is
next to Jothy Theatre. An STF vehicle that came very fast stopped at the
restaurant and then STF men came in, questioned the boys, checked their
identity cards and went away taking S. But they dropped him at the Post Office
Junction within a short time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>*We have given in Special Report No.24 and earlier, a number
of indications that the incident of that evening had been planned. A brother of
one of the victims described what a stallholder at the beach next to EHED told
him he witnessed. That evening one of the victims Rohan and some others bought
some sweetmeats at the stall and as a friendly gesture gave a piece to the navy
man on duty at the checkpoint nearby. The navy man told them not to hang around
there but to go away quickly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>*When the bomb was thrown from the green auto rickshaw, S
too received a slight injury on the foot and ran away, possibly through Customs
Rd. and was in hiding for several months. He apparently did not go to any
clinic to treat his shrapnel injury.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Because S himself was at the scene and was injured, it seems
very unlikely that he was in any way party to what happened. Quite possibly
when the STF took him the previous day from the restaurant, as one of the
parents thinks. They may have talked in a friendly manner with the frightened
boy and obtained information about the habits and movements of the others. It
would be better for him if he testified and put the record straight.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As for Hemachandran-Aathavan, who drove the auto rickshaw
from which a son of Weerakody’s and a vegetable seller threw the bomb at the
boys, he is now believed to be in Qatar. He is the Tamil version of Ice Manju.
Trincomalee awaits a healthier political dispensation where the two communities
would have a meeting point in true friendship rather than in crime.</p>

<h2>After January 2006</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Trincomalee has since the killing of the Five Students been
continually troubled and polarised. On 12<sup>th</sup> April afternoon, a bomb
blast in the Trincomalee market which resulted in six deaths led to a rampage
by the Navy, some members of the Army and a Sinhalese mob in which seven Tamil
civilians were killed, nearly 30 Tamil business premises being burnt and
violence spread to surrounding areas led by the security forces. What was
striking was that the riot started within five minutes of the bomb and we now
have a senior navy officer telling a Tamil friend that the Navy was involved in
the organisation. The Police kept away and the phones of all the security forces
commanders in Trincomalee failed to answer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To this day even the best-informed are not sure about who
planted the bicycle bomb. One businessman told us, “<i>The LTTE has not denied
planting the bomb, but then there was organised rioting within five minutes of
the blast</i>.” Some with a good knowledge of the workings of the intelligence
services are skeptical about the LTTE planting the bomb. They see it as part of
the trend of the State’s actions at that time, starting from the abduction of
TRO members and the killing of the TNA politician Vigneswaran in Trincomalee
five days before the market bomb blast. It was a time the Karuna group and some
cadres of the EPDP were being used by the State in dirty operations. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The trouble at that time was that there was no qualitative
difference between the actions of the LTTE and those of the State. The killing
of the Five Students served for the LTTE the same purpose served by the Sakthy
festival bomb blast. But one was the work of Sinhalese extremists while the other
was the work of the LTTE. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On 25<sup>th</sup> April 2006, following a suicide attempt
on the Army Commander by the LTTE, naval shelling from Trincomalee and air
force bombing killed 13 Tamil civilians around Sampoor. This was attack for the
sake of attack. An air attack on an uncertain target killed four Muslim
civilians in Vattam adjoining Mutur town. To cover it up the Police prevented
the Magistrate from going in saying it was dangerous.</p>

the South in January and early February 2008, a Sinhalese mob in Abhayapura
wanted to attack the Tamil area of Anbuvelipuram. The Police stopped it. But
that was not the end. On 6<sup>th</sup> February at 6.45 PM some youths were
chatting on the road at Anbuvelipuram. Ten security forces men on five
motorcycles appeared accompanying an auto rickshaw with its sides draped in
black like a hearse. The funeral procession stopped. A man in the auto
rickshaw, who could not shoot straight, opened fire. The intended targets, two
youths who had during the CFA helped to decorate for the LTTE inspired Pongu
Thamil celebrations, ran through a saloon and escaped. Two youths <b>Jeevakanthan

area again another sadistic act was performed on 29<sup>th</sup> February 2008.
On 4<sup>th</sup> February three youths were abducted from the area of whom
nothing more was heard. One of them was Thiyoda Christopher (20) whose wife was
under 18. On 29<sup>th</sup> February Christopher phoned his wife and told her
that he was being released and was coming home. The wife happily spread the
word. But her husband did not come. The same night, a van came into the area,
dropped a man, made a turn, shot him dead and went off. It was in the morning
that the wife found the victim to be her husband. There were marks on his hand
to suggest that he had been administered saline, probably after torture. The
same day the Karuna (Pillayan) group came and explained to the people that
these killings and abductions are not done by them. The people are now
