<p>Having taken Valaignarmadam after overcoming strong LTTE resistance, which 
  gave it time to build three defence bunds, the Army on 28<sup>th</sup> April 
  launched a fierce attack on the first bund at Irattaivaykkal. The result as 
  civilians had experienced repeatedly was a rain of army shells falling among 
  IDP camps in Mullivaykkal, two miles south, causing enormous civilian casualties. 
  The Government denied using its heavy weapons while blaming the LTTE of using 
  its. President Rajapakse the previous day pledged that the Government was abandoning 
  the use of heavy weapons. </p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>If there was a military method in this madness, one needs 
  to look back at the experience of civilians in the Udayarkaddu-Suthanthirapuram-Thevipuram 
  safe zone during January and February 2009. In the reality of things, calling 
  the war zone a safe zone was a mere piece of deception for the international 
  community. The civilians were in their bunkers listening to the music of falling 
  shells, having no idea where those shells were coming from. It was when they 
  saw withdrawing LTTE cadres that they knew the Army was very close, perhaps 
  just 50 yards away.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>In normal war, shelling the roads far behind enemy lines made 
  sense to obstruct enemy supplies and reinforcements. In this instance those 
  who got killed were civilians fleeing with their meager belongings. At the same 
  time fighting was fierce and army casualties were heavy. The Government had 
  placed all its eggs in the basket of absolute victory and was prepared to go 
  on at any cost, using patently the most ridiculous deception.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>When it came to the fears and nervousness of the troops against 
  the Government&#146;s obligations to the civilians it purported to rescue, the 
  former meant everything and the latter did not matter at all. Firing its cannon 
  freely into the cowering IDPs became a small matter, if it made the troops a 
  little readier to advance towards the prize of absolute victory.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>At the same time the LTTE showed no mercy in deterring the 
  escape of civilians, as if in the hope that the cries of genocide and humanitarian 
  catastrophe by its expatriate lobbies would buy it a reprieve.</span></p>
<p>In this final phase, a major element in the Army&#146;s nervousness consisted 
  of the Sea Tigers and Black Tigers. The LTTE&#146;s land based offensive capacity 
  had been broken after the victory at Anandapuram. Since then much of the LTTE&#146;s 
  defensive capability had shifted to the Sea Tiger and Black Tiger units. </p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>Once the LTTE lost Chalai and Putumattalan, the Sea Tiger 
  assets were shifted to the Mullivaykkal coast. The military surveillance (e.g. 
  by UAVs) was so high that launching out a boat and later dragging it up the 
  shore and camouflaging it became very risky. At the end of April, the Navy gun 
  boats were stationed off the coast to cover the Army&#146;s advance. This meant 
  that the civilians got a heavy dose of firing from machine guns and cannon from 
  both land and sea.</span></p>
<p>According to persons from the area, another strategy used by the LTTE during 
  the protracted battle for Puthikkudiyiruppu was to station disabled suicide 
  cadres with explosives in bunkers of the kind used by civilians, with instructions 
  to explode <span class=GramE>themselves</span> when a large group of soldiers 
  passed that way. This might explain in part the Army ordered to finish the job 
  in a hurry, reportedly running their heavy vehicles over civilian bunkers, thus 
  burying a significant number of people. </p>

<p><b><span lang=EN-US>Bearing Witness: Mr. and Mrs. Kailash</span></b></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>Towards evening on 28<sup>th</sup> April, amidst the rising 
  tempo of war, Mr. and Mrs. Kailash went to Mullivaikal hospital and then walked 
  down to the beach on the east coast where boats were picking up people for the 
  ICRC ship anchored in the deep sea. LTTE cadres who were giving clearance would 
  not allow them arguing that the lady&#146;s injury was not serious enough. They 
  had to in the end pay them money, a little more than Rs. 100,000/=, before receiving 
  clearance. They say that most of those who came with them did not qualify, but 
  had all paid the LTTE large sums.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>There had been two other boats that had followed theirs&#146; 
  to the waiting ship. As they had just set off into the sea, the military commenced 
  heavy shelling which affected the ICRC&#146;s pick up area. The ICRC could not 
  take in most of the people from the second and third boats as the ship had already 
  reached capacity. The two boats had to return to the coast with virtually all 
  their passengers. The Kailash&#146;s felt that because of the shelling those 
  who returned in the two small boats were at immense risk.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>The same day Mullivaykkal Primary Health Centre was shelled 
  killing six previously injured patients who were receiving treatment. The next 
  day, April 29<sup>th</sup>, the same Centre and the Hospital were both shelled, 
  killing 15 persons. The Hospital was shelled again on 30<sup>th</sup> April 
  and 2<sup>nd</sup> May, killing about 9 and 68 persons respectively.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>A part of the background to this shelling was the large number 
  of army casualties when the Army attacked the first bund on the 28<sup>th</sup> 
  and when the LTTE tried to take it back using human bombs and explosive-packed 
  vehicles, along with suicide boats to break the navy blockade. The Navy towards 
  the end of April deployed boats to seal off the coast, resulting in confrontations 
  between the Navy and the Sea Tigers opposite Mullivaykkal.</span></p>
<p>A likely reason for the massive shelling of Mullivaykkal suggested by an observer 
  present is that the LTTE was planning an offensive operation, which later did 
  not materialise. He thinks the Military would have found out by analysing UAV 
  pictures, showing significant movements of persons and objects. Another reason 
  is the routine shelling when the Army plans to advance. These are text book 
  responses with no cogniscence of political and humanitarian objectives and obligations. 
  </p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>The Defence Ministry reported a naval confrontation early 
  morning on the 29<sup>th</sup>. Around 4.00 PM, 100 mm naval cannon struck Mullivaykkal, 
  which was so crowded that any explosion was potentially lethal, hitting also 
  the Hospital, killing according to <i>TamilNet</i> more than 150 civilians. 
  In the afternoon of the 30<sup>th</sup>, the LTTE claimed sinking one of the 
  Navy&#146;s water jet gun boats and also a Dvora fast attack craft. The Defence 
  Ministry claimed the next day (1<sup>st</sup> May) that it sank three Sea Tiger 
  craft at <st1:time Hour="1" Minute="0" w:st="on">1.00 AM</st1:time>. 110 injured 
  persons were admitted to hospital on the 1<sup>st</sup>; and on the 2<sup>nd</sup>, 
  the hospital was shelled twice in the morning killing 68 patients.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>The ICRC carried out evacuations on 28<sup>th</sup>, 29<sup>th</sup> 
  and 30<sup>th</sup> April. On 30<sup>th</sup> April, ICRC said in a statement, 
  &#147;<i><span style='color:black'>Given the catastrophic situation of thousands 
  of displaced, sick and wounded people still in the conflict area, the parties 
  must do more to protect them and must allow more food and medicine into the 
  area</span></i><span style='color:black'>&#148;. The service was evidently under 
  strain. After negotiations with both parties, the next time the ICRC came was 
  on 7<sup>th</sup> May and it was a hazardous exercise. Its statement said that 
  it could not perform this operation for seven days due to security constraints. 
  Its head of operations for <st1:place w:st="on">South Asia</st1:place> in Geneva 
  Mr. Jacques de Maio said after the evacuation:</span></span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US style='color:black'>&#147;<i>Heavy fighting is taking place 
  near the medical assembly point at Mullavaikkal, which puts the lives of patients, 
  medical workers and ICRC staff at great risk. This hampers medical evacuations 
  of wounded civilians and their families. Not all the wounded could be evacuated 
  <span class=GramE>today,</span> and it is of the utmost importance that more 
  evacuations take place over the coming days</i>.&#148;</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-US>The next day, 8<sup>th</sup> May, saw a new burst of shelling 
  following a lull, when the Army took on the final, 3<sup>rd</sup>, bund at Karaimullivayakkal, 
  two miles north of Mullivaykkal. Food was scarce and on this day, a large number 
  of children were lined up to receive each a &#145;bonda&#146; (made from flour 
  and yam) from a cart that was distributing them, when barrage of shells exploded 
  killing many. A witness told us that a UAV, known to civilians as &#145;<i>vandu</i>&#146; 
  (beetle) was flying overhead and the queue of children waiting for the nutrients 
  would have been clearly seen by those who decided to fire. Our witness saw more 
  than a dozen dead bodies, most of them children. </span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>The Defence Ministry which denied the shelling reported on 
  the following morning, 9<sup>th</sup> May, that about 300 civilians escaped 
  south past the LTTE bunds and surrendered to the 59<sup>th</sup> Division which 
  had already come across the causeway and established a position on the southern 
  extremity of the &#145;safe zone&#146;. It added that nine died of LTTE fire 
  and another 19 touched base with injuries.</span></p>
<p><b><span lang=EN-US>Bearing Witness: Nick</span></b></p>
<p>Nick&#146;s family together with the mother and five children, all less than 
  7 years of age, of another family were holed up in adjacent bunkers during a 
  bout of shelling. Nick was seated on a log at the entrance to his bunker and 
  the father of the other family (who was from Puthukudiyiruppu) was seated on 
  the ground at the entrance to his bunker. The two men were talking. This happens 
  often due to the want of society and the stultifying heat of bunkers. A shell 
  came silently and grazed the Puthukkudiyiruppu man&#146;s head. Bleeding heavily 
  he fell unconscious, as though dead. Nick feels that if not for the victim diverting 
  the shell, it would have fallen clean through the entrance to his bunker and 
  killed his whole family. Thinking that the man was dead or dying, and being 
  conscious of imminent danger of another shell landing in the vicinity, Nick 
  promptly dragged out the mother and 5 children as well as his own family and 
  moved elsewhere. Months later, Nick met the other man in Manik farm IDP camp, 
  reunited with his family. He had been rescued by some Good Samaritan, and through 
  the ICRC eventually transferred to a proper hospital, where he gained consciousness.

<p><span lang=EN-US style='color:black'>Saturday 9<sup>th</sup> May was the last 
  time the ICRC was able to transfer the injured. It said on</span><span
lang=EN-US>12<sup>th</sup><span style='color:black'> May: &#147;<i>Last Saturday, 
  9 May, was the last time the ICRC-chartered ferry was able to reach the conflict 
  area. It offloaded food and life-saving medical supplies, and evacuated 516 
  wounded and sick patients and their accompanying relatives. Fighting also made 
  it impossible for the ferry to approach the shore on the previous day, 8 May. 
  As the fighting draws ever closer, thousands of people trapped along a narrow 
  coastal strip north of Mullaittivu are forced to take cover most of the time 
  in improvised trenches and shelters in order not to be hit by exchanges of fire 
  between government troops and fighters of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam 
  (LTTE). The civilians also suffer from a lack of food, drinking water and proper 
  medical care</i>.&#148;</span></span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US style='color:black'>According to persons present, an issue 
  that prevented the ICRC from evacuating patients in early May was the determination 
  of a safe point. The LTTE wanted it south of the earlier location and the Government 
  reportedly did not agree to it. The new phase <span
class=GramE>beginning on 9<sup>th</sup> May heralded the worst times for the civilians, 
  without any hope of relief, while</span> the Government and the LTTE, having 
  other preoccupations, were the least concerned.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>On the night of 9<sup>th</sup> the Army&#146;s 53<sup>rd</sup> 
  and 58<sup>th</sup> Divisions began moving towards Vellaimullivaykkal, 1.4 miles 
  south. Advancing along the sea coast, the Army had come within 500 yards of 
  <st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">Pillayar Kovil Rd</st1:address></st1:Street>, 
  the ICRC pick up point. But the Army did not use the position to launch offensive 
  operations for several days. The move was preceded by heavy shelling.</span></p>
<p class=anews><span lang=EN-US>On 9<sup>th</sup> May, the heavy shelling and 
  the Army&#146;s manner of advance was such as to brook no delay, even though 
  there were 100 000 civilians cramped in what was left of the NFZ. In the absence 
  of further bunds north of Mullivaykkal, the LTTE offered heavy resistance from 
  the Tsunami Housing Scheme, which stretched from Karaimullivaykkal to (Vellai<span
class=GramE>)Mullivaykkal</span>, east of the main road. This slowed down the 
  Army&#146;s progress until 13<sup>th</sup> May. </span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>At this time the LTTE&#146;s treatment of escapees had become 
  very harsh. A man from Mullaitivu said that frequently persons attempting to 
  run away had been caught by the LTTE, dragged back and shot. He also said that 
  in the latter stages any parent who tried to appeal against the conscription 
  of his or her child was handled very roughly. Whenever people were bold in their 
  protestations, they were threatened with punishment in the &#147;Pannai&#148; 
  (cattle farm) (&#147;<i>Pannaiku vaariya</i>?&#148;). This meant that they were 
  taken to the front lines and told to build bunkers, carry food and supplies 
  for men on the front lines and given other risky chores. Given the current intensity 
  of fighting, virtually all those serving in the <i>Pannai </i>ended up dead.</span></p>
<p class=anews><span lang=EN-US>Sivalingam (not real name) is from 8<sup>th</sup> 
  Channel, Uruthirapuram. His testimony is taken from <i>Thesam.net</i> of <st1:date Month="10" Day="30" Year="2009" w:st="on">30<sup>th</sup> 
  October 2009</st1:date> (<a href="http://thesamnet.co.uk/?p=17325">http://thesamnet.co.uk/?p=17325</a> 
  ). It comes across as the plain, honest testimony of a simple man. Like with 
  most others escape was high on his mind. The question was how and when. Earlier 
  in May, he with his family, his wife, a boy and two <span class=GramE>daughters,</span> 
  had gone to Nanthikadal Lagoon to escape. The Tigers stopped them and conscripted 
  his son. The rest went back to where they stayed, as they had no heart to escape 
  without the son. In order to get hold of his son, Sivalingam hung about places 
  frequented by the Tigers. The Tigers needed logs from cocoanut trees for their 
  defences and they got Sivalingam to use his tractor to transport them. </span></p>
<p class=anews><span lang=EN-US>During this interlude, after transporting some 
  logs, Sivalingam was idling at the bank of Nanthikadal, when he saw an Irrigation 
  Department employee from his village. The Tigers then brought the Irrigation 
  employee&#146;s son of 22 years. The boy was an innocent, who had spent much 
  of his time at home singing <i>thevarams</i> (devotional hymns) in the temple 
  and cleaning up the place. When the LTTE began conscription, the father had 
  hidden him in Mallavi. A long time later the LTTE discovered the boy and conscripted 
  him in Mullivaykkal. The Tigers also brought a girl conscript from the same 
  village, whose parents had escaped to Vavuniya earlier. The Tigers told the 
  irrigation man to take his son and the girl and go. The Tigers waited until 
  they were knee deep in the lagoon and opened fire, killing the girl on the spot. 
  The boy who was injured in the ear and chest, clutched his father&#146;s feet 
  and shouted, &#145;<i>Appa (Father), Amma (Mother)</i>&#146;! Sivalingam helped 
  them to take the boy to an LTTE hospital nearby. The Tigers told them, &#145;<i>We 
  don&#146;t have any medicines, go away</i>.&#146; The boy died and they best 
  they could do was to bury him in a grave half a foot deep, dug with their hands.</span></p>
<p class=anews><span lang=EN-US>On 9<sup>th</sup> May, while Sivalingam was transporting 
  and delivering logs, he saw his son dressed in a uniform stitched from a bed 
  sheet. His mother promptly ordered him to climb into the trailer, where she 
  covered him with tarpaulin. They drove away and quickly moved residence elsewhere. 
  Sivalingam observed that they did not receive any food over the next 5 or 6 
  days. He also observed that there was hardly any burying of the dead after 8<sup>th</sup> 
  May and numerous dead bodies were lying all over the place as also said by others.</span></p>

<p class=anews><span lang=EN-US>A grandmother from Thirunagar, Kilinochchi, was 
  to take the ICRC ship on this day, 9<sup>th</sup>. She was in charge of her 
  little grand daughter, who had a leg amputated after being caught in a shell 
  blast. The ship, having to carry accumulated numbers of injured and loaded to 
  capacity, left without them. The ICRC promised to return the next day, but the 
  continuous rain of shells ensured that it was to be the last journey.</span></p>
<p class=anews><span lang=EN-US>After the ship left, the grand mother took her 
  grand daughter and went to a nearby house close to the embarkation point, left 
  their things and stayed in a bunker with others. After nightfall, the tempo 
  of shelling increased. The grand mother left the bunker and rushed to the house 
  saying that she wanted to collect their documents and money. While she was inside 
  a shell fell on the house, severing the lower part of her body. The story was 
  told to us by Gunam, a friend of the family who was with the grand daughter. 
  </span></p>
<p class=anews><span lang=EN-US>The shelling that night became an international 
  issue. It later led to the Government forcing the doctors to recant all they 
  said from the war zone after they left the NFZ on 15<sup>th</sup> or 16<sup>th</sup> 
  May. The doctors, according to others who had spoken to them, believed that 
  facts stated with regard to accuracy are the most effective.<span
style='color:black'> Other witnesses present have confirmed the high death toll 
  during those days</span>. </span></p>
<p>A report by Ravi Nessman of the AFP quoted Dr. Shanmugarajah, one of the doctors 
  at Mullivakkal Hospital: &#147;<i>Two overnight artillery barrages (9<sup>th</sup>, 
  10<sup>th</sup><span
class=apple-converted-space><span style='color:black;'>&nbsp;</span></span>May) 
  pounded the area over the weekend, with several shells landing inside newly 
  demarcated &#145;safe zone&#146;, where the government had urged civilians to 
  gather, according to Dr. V. Shanmugarajah, another doctor at the hospital. A 
  total of 430 ethnic Tamil civilians, including 106 children, were either brought 
  to the hospital for burial or died at the facility after those attacks, he said. 
  But the death toll was likely closer to 1,000 because many of those killed would 
  have been buried in the bunkers where they were slain, and many of the gravely 
  wounded never made it to the hospital for treatment, he said</i>.&#148;</p>
<p><span lang=EN-US style='color:black'>Once the Army began advancing on 9<sup>th</sup> 
  May, government run medical facilities ceased to be any indicator of civilian 
  casualties. After the shelling of 9<sup>th</sup> night, Dr. Shanmugarajah spoke 
  of 1100 new admissions. </span><span lang=EN-US>Taken together with details 
  in <i>TamilNet</i>, different aspects of the story, along with the doctor&#146;s 
  claims, are remarkably consistent. <span style='color:black'></span></span></p>
<p class=anews><span lang=EN-US>The Army began moving again on 13<sup>th</sup> 
  May. A relatively small number who came out of their bunkers with their hands 
  up were sent northwards into the army-controlled area. According to <i>defence.lk</i>

<p><span lang=EN-US>Sivalingam and family had to keep moving trying to choose 
  every time a new place that seemed safer. In front of his tent were a father, 
  mother and three children who were all killed when a shell fell on them. There 
  had also been a business family, who were in a tent next to his. A shell fell 
  killing all 16 of them. He said that at this time the LTTE was killing escapees 
  mercilessly. There were many instances when the Tigers waited for the escaping 
  family to get into the water and fired bursts at the children, watching them 
  writhe and die, in convulsions of hands and legs.</span></p>
<p><b><span lang=EN-US>Bearing Witness: Komathy</span></b></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>An elderly retired lady teacher, whom we call Komathy, was 
  in an evangelical Christian group that abhorred violence, but her son had two 
  years earlier during the conscription drive become involved with the LTTE. The 
  lady was looking after the son&#146;s four children, daughter-in-law and a senior 
  niece who had been a long time cripple. If not for the latter she would have 
  attempted to escape earlier. During these latter stages, her son in the LTTE 
  had developed extreme anxiety for the safety of his children and suffered psychologically. 
  But he kept bringing the mother news about the goings on that came to his ears.<span

<p><span lang=EN-US>Komathy, who was originally at Valaignarmadam, had when the 
  Army was moving in, shifted near Karimullivaykkal, north of Mullivaykkal. She 
  said that the LTTE resisted the armed forces&#146; attempt to break the defense 
  bund very fiercely and successfully. She says that about 14 Kfirs were used 
  by the armed forces in addition to heavy shelling and the use of tanks and ground 
  troops. She had seen the jets swoop down and re-ascend as the Tigers, including 
  their girls, fired fiercely from the ground.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US style='color:black'>On the 12<sup>th</sup>, the waiting room 
  at the hospital was hit by a mortar shell, killing scores of civilians sheltering 
  in the admission room. </span><span lang=EN-US>The same day, a young man joined 
  Sivalingam&#146;s family. He had sent his wife and mother out and stayed behind. 
  He felt that his presence would have made them more vulnerable to punitive measures 
  by the LTTE against escapees. At that time sugar cost Rs. 5500 (USD 55) a kg. 
  On the morning of 13<sup>th</sup> May, the young man went to a tea shop to get 
  himself a cup of tea. A shell fell on the shop killing all who were there. Sivalingam 
  said that out of the eleven sandbags they had to protect themselves against 
  shelling, they undid one, covered the young man&#146;s body with it and moved 
  away. They never found out who he was or from where.</span></p>
<p>The Tigers had also built three bunds for their southern defence at Vattuvakkal, 
  facing Mullaitivu. The Army&#146;s 59<sup>th</sup> Division had before 9<sup>th</sup>

  had breached the first of the bunds by 12<sup>th</sup> May. </p>

<p>Later when the Army began moving south on 13<sup>th</sup> May in the face of 
  continuing LTTE resistance, Komathy also confirmed that civilians running south 
  to Mullivaykkal told others that advancing soldiers popped grenades into civilian 
  bunkers as a precaution against the LTTE using these bunkers to attack them. 
  She observed that LTTE resistance petered out on 14<sup>th</sup> May leading 
  to a lull. </p>
<p>Komathy also heard of the Army reacting to fierce Tiger resistance, and heavy 
  casualties on their side, by firing into and closing up civilian bunkers during 
  their latter advance. </p>
<p><b><span lang=EN-US>Bearing Witness: &#147;Revathy&#148;</span></b></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>Revathy (name altered) is a worker for an evangelical church, 
  who was north of Mullivaykkal with her two brothers, the family of one of them 
  including his mother-in-law and children, and another sister. A fellow worker 
  from the church who was helping them had been killed by a missile while transporting 
  timber with other men to strengthen their bunker. </span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>Revathy and her siblings said that most of the people at that 
  time had been hiding in bunkers because of the heavy shelling. On 13<sup>th</sup> 
  May those who came running south from near Karaimullivaykkal said that the advancing 
  army had run their heavy vehicles over these bunkers, turning the bunkers into 
  graves for so many. Although the ground was soggier to the west of the main 
  road, the Army&#146;s tracked vehicles were able to operate off the main road, 
  particularly to the east of it. </span></p>
<p><b><span lang=EN-US>Bearing Witness: Muhunthan</span></b></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>Muhunthan had in the IDP camp met several people known to 
  him from Mallavi, who had left the NFZ at the very last stages. The LTTE offered 
  fierce resistance using also Black Tiger suicide squads. The Army was panicked 
  into not taking chances and fired RPGs at any structure that looked a possible 
  LTTE defence point. The ground being soggy or sandy, the bunkers had been constructed 
  by reinforcing the sides with wooden posts raised above ground level and thatched 
  to give shelter, which made them look like defence points. </span></p>
<p>Other sources told us that during the earlier battles in Puthukkudiyiruppu, 
  disabled Black Tigers used to stay in bunkers and blast themselves when a large 
  group of soldiers passed them. They stayed several days until a sufficiently 
  large group of soldiers came their way. But in Mullivaykkal, Black Tigers used 
  to run into the Army on motorcycles or small vehicles and blast <span class=GramE>themselves</span>. 
  They could not use larger vehicles as a large number of vehicles were parked 
  on and along the main road. At this stage Black Tigers were used chiefly to 
  provide security for senior leaders. By blasting <span class=GramE>themselves</span> 
  when troops came too near, they gave time for other security persons who ringed 
  the object protected, to get the object away. </p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>Sensing that the oncoming troops from the 53<sup>rd</sup> 
  and 58<sup>th</sup> Divisions were in a rough mood after taking many casualties, 
  most of the civilians to the north of Mullivaykkal fled southwards where the 
  LTTE still remained. Their reports further alarmed the people. Consequently, 
  the people began edging southwards despite the lack of space. The people wanted 
  to get out and surrender to the Army so that their immediate ordeal would come 
  to an end. Afraid of the advancing troops, they thought it safer to move south 
  and surrender to the 59<sup>th</sup> Division at the Mullaitivu end, which they 
  perceived as more accommodative towards the civilians&#146; plight. </span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US style='color:black'>On 13<sup>th</sup> May the Mullivaykkal 
  makeshift hospital in a school building closed, after the hospital was hit and

  when the hospital was hit by a mortar shell. </span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-US style='color:black'>14<sup>th</sup> May saw a lull in the 
  fighting. Talk began to get around that the LTTE would soon allow the people 
  to leave. Sea Tiger leader Soosai was widely reported saying that the LTTE would 
  soon give up arms as the means of liberation. At this time there was also confusion 
  among the LTTE cadres about whether or not to let the civilians go. A community 
  leader told us that on 14<sup>th</sup> May, the LTTE discharged most women cadres.</span></p>
<p>Confusion among LTTE ranks was also confirmed by the retired lady teacher Komathy 
  above. The LTTE also for the first time, on 14<sup>th</sup> May, announced that 
  civilians who wanted to leave could leave. However, there were some instances 
  after that where they had ordered would be escapees not to do so. We reported 
  in Special Report No.32 that a large group of civilians, who went to a palmyra 
  nursery near Nanthikadal Lagoon before dawn on the 14<sup>th</sup> to cross 
  to the other side or to Vattuvakkal to the south, were shot at by the LTTE killing 
  about 500 of them. We have had further confirmation of this. </p>
<p><span lang=EN-US style='color:black'>The three bunds to the south had been 
  under the Sea Tigers, who had so far lost one. They apparently allowed about 
  1000 people to go across to the Army on the 14<sup>th</sup> evening.</span></p>

font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;'></span></h1>
<p><span lang=EN-US style='color:black'>15<sup>th</sup> May was a day of confusion 
  even for the Tigers. There were negotiations and several variations in how the 
  Tigers handled civilians who wanted to escape. Some appeared to think that some 
  deal had been almost worked out, while others saw it as important to hold on 
  to the civilians for a successful outcome.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US style='color:black'>Sivalingam and his family tried to leave. 
  Another young unmarried woman joined their family of five along with another 
  relative. Near the Nanthikadal lagoon, some LTTE men confronted them saying 
  that the ICRC and US ships are coming to save them and told them to go back. 
  There being just a few of them, they did not argue, even as people were leaving 
  by various other ways. They went back a little and sat among some palmyra logs. 
  </span></p>
<p>When some Tigers came that way, the young woman who was part of Sivalingam&#146;s 
  company, argued with them, &#147;<i>We are hungry and suffering much, please 
  let us go</i>.&#148; The Tigers shot her dead, while the others stared in terror, 
  and ordered them to go back to Mullivaykkal town. They went back and lay down 
  beneath their tractor-trailer. They saw many dead beneath the tractors and <span class=GramE>lorries</span> 
  where they had sheltered. The streets too had corpses everywhere besides torn 
  pieces of flesh.</p>
<p><span lang=EN-US style='color:black'>On 15<sup>th</sup> May afternoon, Dr. 
  Varatharajah said in an audio interview with an expatriate journal:</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US style='color:black'>&#147;</span><i><span lang=EN-GB>Shells 
  are coming close to hospital; three to four of our staff <span
class=GramE>were</span> killed within the last three days. These three days we 
  didn&#146;t treat the patients. Wounded are dying without treatment. Both wounded 
  and dead are in the same place, still they are not separated. Around 300 to 
  400 patients and dead bodies are mingled lying here and there on the floor</span></i><span
lang=EN-GB>.&#148;</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>This meant that most of the 2000 or so injured in the hospital 
  three days earlier had been taken away by relatives, many no doubt died. Those 
  still in hospital were dying or had no one to care for them. The absence of 
  medicine and the pain of separation would have prompted people in a crowd slowly 
  edging its way south to bear injured relatives along in the hope of treatment 
  once in the government-controlled area.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>There was no working system there by means of which one could 
  quantify human suffering. Witnesses said that because of the dense crowd pressing 
  south from 11<sup>th</sup> May one could not even wait in a place for half an 
  hour. There was no food or medicine available. The people were on or close to 
  the main road to Vattuvakal, which itself was choked with vehicles. People crept 
  under the vehicles for shelter as shells fell everywhere. Occasionally a vehicle 
  that was close to a shell explosion caught fire. About 20 shell explosions could 
  be heard every minute. Occasionally when a vehicle was hit, the road would be 
  blocked for a short time, and then the crowd surged forward preoccupied with 
  their own concerns such as locating separated family members.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>On the 15<sup>th</sup> morning the people tried to break through 
  towards Mullaitivu. Thrice the LTTE chased them back and also resisted the advance 
  of the 59<sup>th</sup> Division using suicide bombers. </span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>Witnesses have testified that on the 15<sup>th</sup> and 16<sup>th</sup>, 
  every time a group of people set off to flee, a line of Tigers would face them 
  and block their path. When the crowd pushed forward they would shoot at their 
  legs and damage a few legs and even kill others in order to scare them away. 
  Even then there were many who had become desperate beyond control. They just 
  pushed through the space between adjacent Tigers in the line and marched towards 
  the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Vattuvakal</st1:PlaceName> 
  <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Bridge</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>, where the 59<sup>th</sup> 
  Division was. Frequently the Tiger line moved backwards under pressure and stayed 
  facing the advancing people to shoot again. </span><span lang=EN-GB>By the end 
  of the day&#146;s battles, the 59<sup>th</sup> Division had got hold of the 
  second of the three bunds to the south, leaving the Tigers in control of the 
  remaining bund.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>As we reported in Special Report No.32, the Government had 
  informally agreed to a surrender deal worked out by intermediaries including 
  some Tamil MPs and senior aid agency figures. By this time Pottu Amman was in 
  charge of military matters. Later in the day the fighting and shelling eased 
  and the LTTE began burning its equipment, a signal that it was implementing 
  its side of the bargain, whose outlines we described in Special Report No.32:</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>&#147;</span><i><span lang=EN-US style='color:black'>The Government 
  would accept the surrender of the remaining LTTE personnel and leaders, with 
  due consideration to prevailing norms of surrender, and allow a certain number 
  of leaders to leave the country, the conditions being: 1.) Surrender of Weapons 
  and equipment, 2.) Release of Civilians and 3.) Release of prisoners from the 
  government forces the LTTE held.</span></i></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US style='color:black'>&#147;<i>The LTTE agreed to destroy its 
  weapons and equipment instead of surrendering them, and apparently this was 
  agreed. On Friday 15<sup>th</sup><span
class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span>it began complying with 1.) <span
class=GramE>&amp; 2.).</span> It also complied with 3.) <span class=GramE>as</span> 
  would be seen. According to our information three TNA MPs, including Chandra 
  Nehru Jr., were among those involved in making these arrangements</i>.&#148;</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>During the lull the crowds began surging south towards Vattuvakal. 
  The Sea Tigers who were in charge of the remaining bund allowed hundreds of 
  civilians to go to the 59<sup>th</sup> Division. We learn that they were faulted 
  for this and on the 16<sup>th</sup> night, the Sea Tigers were taken out and 
  another group was placed in charge of the bund.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>At <st1:time
Hour="21" Minute="0" w:st="on">9.00 PM</st1:time>, Sivalingam&#146;s company rose 
  from beneath the tractor-trailer where they had taken refuge and</span><span
lang=EN-US style='color:black'> went back to Nanthikadal to make another effort 
  at crossing the lagoon. They had slept under a tractor-trailer with other people 
  in two or three groups. The sound of shelling had been constant. They did not 
  rouse themselves in the night to check even when a shell fell close by. Later 
  they found that entire families had been killed, except perhaps a child. On 
  the 15<sup>th</sup> night many who were under tractors were killed or shredded. 
  They went to the place where they had lain among palmyra logs the day before, 
  where the Tigers had killed the young virgin. </span></p>
<p><b><span lang=EN-US>Bearing Witness: &#147;Revathy&#148;</span></b></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>In the night of 15<sup>th</sup> May, south of Mullivaykkal, 
  </span><span lang=EN-GB>Revathy, her siblings and brother&#146;s family crossed 
  from Vattuvakkal to Mullaitivu.</span><span lang=EN-US> She had been traumatised 
  by the escape experience expecting at any moment to be cut down as they scrambled 
  over dead body after dead body. She said later in tears and loud moaning that 
  on that particular day itself, around 3000 civilians would have perished.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>Revathy&#146;s impression was that the shelling was done by 
  both parties, the LTTE shelling from among the civilians at advancing troops. 
  Thus the civilian deaths were caused by the Army&#146;s indiscriminate shelling, 
  though they were provoked by the LTTE in much smaller measure. The Army took 
  in Revathy&#146;s party at Vattuvakkal and sent them across the bridge after 
  asking why they came so late in the day. They accepted their explanation that 
  they had hesitated and delayed because of having so many young children. Revathy&#146;s 
  family w</span><span lang=EN-GB>ere sent to Omanthai and then to an IDP camp 
  in Chettikulam by 16<sup>th</sup> night.</span></p>

<p>Having spent the night among <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Palmyra</st1:place></st1:City> 
  logs close to Nanthikadal, Sivalingam&#146;s party found themselves in the morning 
  in the company of several others, all in readiness to run towards the Army. 
  As the sun rose, there were about 20 of them sheltering from the sun in the 
  shadow of one <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Palmyra</st1:place></st1:City> 
  tree. Later they noticed the Army at hailing distance. The Tigers, who were 
  also around, shouted, &#147;<i>Go away, don&#146;t wait here</i>&#148;! Subsequently, 
  they threw a grenade at the Army. The Army replied with a shell that fell close 
  to the people, killing about 17 persons. The time was <st1:time Hour="13" Minute="0" w:st="on">1.00 
  PM</st1:time> on Saturday 16<sup>th</sup> May. Sivalingam felt they had made 
  a mistake in coming there, &#147;<i>Many others had escaped by other ways, and 
  only a small number of us got caught to these few brutes</i>. <i>We had no choice 
  but to hang around</i>.&#148; </p>
<p><b><span lang=EN-GB>Bearing Witness: Nick</span></b></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>There were people constantly crossing Nanthikadal from different 
  points. Nick related the tragic story of Kumarasamy (names altered), <span class=GramE>whose</span> 
  father, Periyathamby, was a sickly old widower from Nick&#146;s area.</span><span lang=EN-US> 
  Kumarasamy was looking after his own family with young children as well as the 
  sickly father. With much caution and difficulty he was making good his escape 
  towards Nanthikadal with his family and was supporting his flagging father. 
  As he came to Nanthikadal the son found to his dismay that the father had become 
  too weak and felt that he would not bear the strain of crossing. He left the 
  father under a tree by the shore with a sheet for cover, 6 or 7 biscuit packets, 
  and two cans of water and crossed over with his family. Nick later met Kumarasamy 
  among IDPs at Manik farm inquiring with tears from people as to whether anyone 
  heard anything about his father&#146;s presence among the IDPs.</span></p>

  Truce and Denial of Relief to the Injured</font></span></a></h1>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>The LTTE had requested the ICRC to come and take away the 
  injured civilians and cadres. The ICRC ship had been in the vicinity for some 
  days, but did not receive clearance from the Government to deliver essentials 
  and take away the injured and others with urgent complaints. The refusal also 
  suggested that the Government was not taking its side of the bargain (above) 
  seriously. It wanted to get the civilians away so that it could use indiscriminate 
  firing without international repercussions.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>That third party negotiations were going on, as we reported, 
  was further confirmed indirectly by a civilian who knew some senior LTTE men. 
  We pointed out earlier that the Sea Tigers were removed from the southern bund 
  for allowing civilians to leave prematurely. However on 16<sup>th</sup> May, 
  about mid-day, the civilians were in a confused and disorganised manner allowed 
  to leave, even as some groups took punitive action into the afternoon. The civilians 
  in Mullivaykkal began moving south towards Mullaitivu. </span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>Meanwhile the Army&#146;s 59<sup>th</sup> Division moved north 
  and later in the day linked up with a section of the 58<sup>th</sup> Division 
  moving south along the sea coast (the 53<sup>rd</sup> was moving parallely south 
  along the lagoon coast of the strip).</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>Our civilian source noted that senior LTTE members were staying 
  behind, seemingly not very perturbed. When he asked them, they replied that 
  talks were going on after which they would leave. They expected a favourable 
  response by late morning. To most observers, even if the Government made promises 
  through third parties, it would have been to facilitate decapitating the LTTE 
  leadership rather than to hinder it. In this instance the LTTE had let the civilians 
  go, making the Government&#146;s work easier. Why the LTTE misread the signs 
  says something about their cutting themselves off from the real world.</span></p>
<p><b><span lang=EN-GB>An Aborted Escape Attempt:</span></b> Our source also told 
  us that if not for their hope in the negotiations, they would certainly have 
  attempted to make a break for it in the early hours of the 16<sup>th</sup> instead 
  of the 17<sup>th</sup> morning, when several of the senior leaders crossed the 
  lagoon and tried to break westwards into the jungle. The attempt failed with 
  senior LTTE leaders being captured or killed. According to numerological beliefs 
  the LTTE long took seriously, dates on which the digits added up to 8, e.g. 
  8<sup>th</sup>, 17<sup>th</sup>, and 26<sup>th</sup> as unlucky days for operations 
  (digits totalling 5 were the lucky days). It was for the urgency caused by the 
  delay that they attempted it on the 17<sup>th</sup>. </p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>There were also stories circulating among civilians who remained 
  to the last that there was an attempt to get the LTTE leader away on the 15<sup>th</sup> 
  or 16<sup>th</sup> May. The retired lady teacher whose son was in the LTTE heard 
  a story</span><span
lang=EN-US> that the leader came pretty close to perishing about this time as 
  there was an unexpected hole in the 7 ringed security ring around him and the 
  troops almost got him. They were apparently trying to smuggle him away and important 
  people were put in command of each ring and there was a failure in the passing 
  of information. The commander of a particular ring had not been present at the 
  designated spot. There was a story of betrayal. The lady teacher heard that 
  Prabhakaran had later called up the commander and questioned him, and then killed 
  him. She remembers the name as Bhanu, though she was a little hazy about it. 
  </span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>Another source with good information said that there was an 
  aborted attempt to get the leader away across Nanthikadal on the 16<sup>th</sup>. 
  He had heard the story about Bhanu but dismissed it as speculation. He thinks 
  Bhanu fell into the Army&#146;s hands, although there is no confirmation from 
  the Army. Negotiations, there were, but the Leader had not apparently relied 
  on them fully. Interestingly, many IDPs had heard the story that it was the 
  treachery of Bhanu that caused the Anandapuram disaster in early April. This 
  discredited story points to some apologists for the LTTE using Bhanu as a scapegoat. 
  <b>The</b> <b>LTTE have always paraded &#145;traitors&#146; to explain the inevitable 
  consequences of their politics.</b></span></p>
<p><b><span lang=EN-US>Bearing Witness: &#147;Kannan&#148;</span></b></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>Kannan, a family man from Visuamadu, set off with his family 
  and younger brother from Mullivaykkal along the Nanthikadal coast towards Irattaivaykkal 
  at <st1:time Hour="14"
Minute="0" w:st="on">2.00 PM</st1:time> on the 16<sup>th</sup>. There were no 
  noises from gun fire at that time. He was from a family of nine siblings and 
  the rest of his family had gone to Vavuniya before 2009. He set off from Visuamadu 
  with the refugee exodus to Suthanthirapuram the previous January and began moving 
  to Putumattalan after 12 days. His younger brother was riding a bicycle in Thevipuram 
  ahead of them when a shell exploded injuring his brother, after which he was 
  unable to use a leg and a hand. The LTTE would not have allowed young persons 
  with a chance of being cured to board the ICRC ship. This was a reason why Kannan 
  had to wait. He managed to reach the 53<sup>rd</sup> Division with his younger 
  brother without incident. He has improved steadily under medical treatment. 
  Along the Nanthikadal shore he saw about 500 corpses.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>Once the ICRC was disallowed, hundreds of injured too weak 
  to be taken away or with no family or friends at hand were left in the lurch. 
  Since medicines had run out and the hospital ground to a halt, it was four days 
  since the injured had received even the most rudimentary treatment. It was time 
  for people to get away if they could and the surviving medical staff (about 
  three of them had been killed) joined the milling crowds edging their way out. 
  An eyewitness testified to seeing scores of injured cadres left on the sides 
  of the road begging people to help them. Civilian injured usually had some known 
  persons to carry them in improvised stretchers made with sheets. </span></p>
<p><b><span lang=EN-GB>Bearing Witness: Gunam</span></b></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>Among the most tragic sights were hundreds of young injured 
  LTTE cadres, many of them girls, who were brought early in the morning of 16<sup>th</sup> 
  May and stretched out along the sides of the road near the southern end of the 
  NFZ. The LTTE originally hoped that the Government would give the ICRC clearance 
  to come over the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">Vattuvakkal</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Bridge</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> 
  and pick them up. This did not materialise although as late as <st1:time
Hour="11" Minute="0" w:st="on">11.00 AM</st1:time>, they were still hopeful. </span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>The victims who had lost limbs and some their sight, were 
  by evening screaming in agony, begging for someone to take them along or at 
  least to give them a cyanide capsule. A ten year old boy searched the road for 
  cyanide capsules and gave them to some of the injured cadres. The injured above 
  were the worst cases with no one to care for them. Most of the other injured, 
  perhaps around 1000, had been taken by their families or friends.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>The cadres who survived the fighting, once they knew their 
  families were leaving, had abandoned their cyanide capsules and uniforms, put 
  on civilian clothes and joined the exodus with their families. That was how 
  there were plenty of cyanide capsules along the roadsides. On the previous day 
  when the LTTE had begun setting fire to their equipment, a number of cadres, 
  especially women, who had disabilities due to injury, had cast themselves into 
  the flames.</span></p>

<p><b><span lang=EN-GB>Bearing Witness: &#147;Rani&#148;</span></b></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>A mother, Rani, (not real name) who left Mullivaykkal late 
  on the 16<sup>th</sup> evening, said that her husband was injured in a shell 
  attack on 28<sup>th</sup> April and died in hospital on 30<sup>th</sup> April. 
  The LTTE had conscripted her 15-year-old daughter in February 2009, whom she 
  had not seen for some time. She had been searching for her daughter. She found 
  two large tents full of injured LTTE cadres. Those who were nursing them had 
  fled intending to escape with the crowd. The road to Vattuvakkal was jam packed 
  and there was no movement as the Army had closed the entry. She set off north 
  along the main road towards Irattaivaikkal as many others had done. Quite by 
  chance she saw her daughter among those left along the road in the hope that 
  the ICRC would come. One of her legs had been amputated after a shell injury 
  and her other leg had wounds that had become badly infected. She promptly took 
  her daughter and moved slowly with the crowd along the main road towards Irattaivaykkal. 
  </span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>By then the LTTE must have decided that the Government was 
  not interested in their surrender. The road was packed with vehicles. In anticipation 
  of the Army&#146;s move into the final safe zone, the LTTE began exploding many 
  of the vehicles, with a view to blocking the Army&#146;s movement. Off the road 
  movement was not so easy because of marshy ground to the west and sandy soil 
  to the east. Rani saw many people on the road being injured or killed by these 
  explosions. <b>By then the Army too began moving south. She had been distracted 
  looking for her ten year old son who had become separated from her and had left 
  her injured daughter on the road for a short time. This was when soldiers encountered 
  her and virtually pushed her behind them (to the north) not heeding her anguished 
  plea that she had to fetch her crippled daughter.</b></span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>Rani now pleads, &#145;<i>Please find my daughter</i>&#146;. 
  By a quirk of fate, Rani found her lost daughter in a pitiful state only to 
  lose her an hour later. She had run into the Army just when it had begun its 
  final advance. This is confirmed by the Army&#146;s claim at <st1:time Hour="17" Minute="0" w:st="on">5.00 
  PM</st1:time> on the 17<sup>th</sup> that the LTTE had been boxed into an area 
  400m x 600m. What chance did a lame mite have when an army that would brook 
  no delay advanced behind monstrous hulks of iron? </span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>The experience above suggests that whatever hopes the Government 
  had given about a ceasefire were at an end and a final battle was in prospect 
  amidst more than 35 000 civilians trapped in a small area. Given the rush and 
  congestion of people leaving many stayed back in the belief that the apparent 
  calm would hold, the Army would move in without firing a shot and they could 
  surrender. Once the LTTE started burning vehicles and the Army resumed shelling 
  there was panic among those remaining. Many decided that it was better to go 
  towards army lines despite the shelling and small arms fire.</span></p>
<p><b><span lang=EN-GB>Bearing Witness: &#147;Kiruban&#148;</span></b></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>Kiruban (18), not real name, was in a family that had left 
  <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Jaffna</st1:place></st1:City> during 
  the October 1995 Exodus (Special Report No.6) and settled down in Killinochchi. 
  During the earlier shelling the family had spent much of their time sheltering 
  under vehicles, with corpses nudging them wherever they lay. This life has been 
  described by persons who were there as between <i>chalam</i> and <i>pinam</i> 
  (between faeces and corpses). They had waited when the firing stopped around 
  <st1:time Hour="12" Minute="0" w:st="on">noon</st1:time> thinking it was all 
  over.</span></p>
<p>To their surprise heavy shelling began again around sunset. In a group of about 
  1000 they began moving towards Irattaivaykkal along the shore on Nanthikadal. 
  The shelling caused several deaths in the crowd of people. Kiruban too saw hundreds 
  of corpses on the way. He estimated that about 150 of those in the crowd got 
  killed. He too was injured in a leg by shrapnel. His sister received a bullet 
  in her stomach. The Army met them and Kiruban was dispatched to <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">Polonnaruwa</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Hospital</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> 
  where his leg was amputated. His sister survived after medical care. </p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>There is hardly anything in the Government&#146;s conduct 
  here that suggests hostage rescue. The Government negotiated a ceasefire with 
  the LTTE to make it let the civilians go with no intention of implementing it. 
  The civilians were given no instructions by the Government. Had it let the ICRC 
  in to supervise the civilian exodus it could have been done in an orderly manner 
  and the injured left behind could have been saved. The civilians were simply 
  allowed to take their chances and leave. After sunset the Government resumed 
  hostilities placing those who were left behind in a dilemma. Staying or going 
  could both spell death and 35 000 remained. The next day the Government happily 
  announced that all hostages had left and launched its final indiscriminate offensive.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-US>Nick and his family were among those who entered the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">Vattuvakal</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Bridge</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> 
  on the 16<sup>th</sup> night and got into Mullaitivu early morning on the 17<sup>th</sup>. 
  Those who went in the night, including Nick&#146;s party were all asked to sit 
  down throughout the length of the long bridge. They were all huddled together 
  in a packed crowd with no opportunity to observe social etiquette. The military 
  <span
class=GramE>men</span> who had been told by the Government that there were not 
  more than 20 000 people left under LTTE control, were thoroughly surprised that 
  several times that number had been in the area.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>Nick said that even at that late stage during the 16<sup>th</sup> 
  night, a group of Tigers was fighting desperately. The Army was shelling fiercely. 
  As Nick&#146;s party ran out, they had regularly to take cover behind heaps 
  of dead bodies, whenever there was a spate of shelling and run again desperately, 
  holding on to dear life, when it abated. As they took cover and lay low often 
  touching the corpses that gave them a modicum of protection, they had the impression 
  that some of those bodies had been lying there for days, incurring decay and 
  infection. They just wiped their hands on their clothing covering the thighs 
  and kept running until the next round of shelling. All the bodies had large 
  and often whole portions ripped off. It was a horrifying experience, which Nick 
  says would haunt their memories for the rest of their days. This was also a 
  critical time in Nick&#146;s daughter&#146;s pregnancy. She became a happy mother 
  in September 2009.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>Once the Army had got the people to the other side of the 
  bridge and loaded them into buses, the noise of shells rose fiercely on the 
  17<sup>th</sup> morning. Nick felt that in Mullivaykkal the Army&#146;s pressure 
  on the LTTE had been most severe from the north, east and west and the latter 
  had withdrawn further south into an enclave that was easier to defend and were 
  fighting desperately. </span></p>

  of the Road at Kepapulavu? Balakumar Surrenders</font></span></a></h1>
<p><span lang=EN-US>With the first light at <st1:time Hour="5"
Minute="30" w:st="on">5.30 AM</st1:time>, Sivalingam surveyed the scene and found 
  no signs of the LTTE. He does not know what happened to them. 50 yards away, 
  he saw the Army behind sand bags, who shouted at them to come quickly. Sivalingam&#146;s 
  family went immediately. The soldiers gave them biscuits and bottles of water 
  and sent them on to get into buses and go to the IDP camps.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>On the other side of Nanthikadal, at Kepapulavu, some key 
  LTTE leaders, including Prabhakaran, Pottu Amman and Soosai, with a core group 
  of fighters, had made a bid to cut their way through the 53<sup>rd</sup> Division 
  westwards into the jungle. We said based on information we obtained through 
  well-placed army sources that Prabhakaran and probably members of his family 
  were captured, Prabhakaran was executed the same day or the next and his 12-year-old 
  son Balachandran was executed in front of the father (see Special Report No.32). 
  Nothing has since been heard about his wife Mathivathani or daughter Dwaraka, 
  nor have there been any reports of their body being found. We have nothing more 
  to say on this subject, except that our story has not been contradicted by evidence 
  and the Government&#146;s denials and its own versions about Prabhakaran&#146;s 
  death carry no credibility. Photographs of the dead body of Balachandran showing 
  injuries on his body, taken apparently by a soldier&#146;s cell phone camera, 
  are in the public domain and are open to investigation by experts.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>A witness, who had reached the 59<sup>th</sup> Division at 
  Mullaitivu on the 17<sup>th</sup> morning, told us that he heard gunfire from 
  the direction at Kepapulavu. He added that he also heard gun fire receding westwards, 
  suggesting to him that some members of the LTTE got through the army lines. 
  The escape strategy attempted by the LTTE leader was the same as that used by 
  Pottu Amman (who was in charge of the escape) in the defence of Puthukkudiyiruppu 
  during early February 2009. A group that crossed Nanthikadal then had cut through 
  the line of the 59<sup>th</sup> Division in Kepapulavu and isolated a section 
  of it in the north. </span></p>
<p><b><span lang=EN-US>Balakumar Surrenders</span></b></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>EROS leader Balakumar understood the LTTE well and had long 
  feared them. When the LTTE provoked a war with the IPKF in 1987, Balakumar reportedly 
  clutched his head saying that Prabhakaran had blown it. Being evidently a weak 
  man having personal rapport with Prabhakaran, his organisation was virtually 
  taken over by the LTTE, against objections from many EROS members. Though Balakumar 
  made political speeches for the LTTE, his reservations were also deep; in recent 
  times he became a source of moral support for dissidents, both EROS and LTTE. 
  Latterly he had separated himself. His family had moved to Udayarkaddu and Balakumar 
  suffered a shell injury in an arm, in December 2008. His wife Indrani, a trained 
  nurse, brought him back to health. Indrani kept the family under her watchful 
  eye, especially their children Sooriyatheepan (19) and Mahilini (18), whom she 
  kept in hiding away from conscription gangs. Balakumar was a sickly man who 
  suffered from high blood pressure, a weak heart and glaucoma.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>In Putumattalan, some of Balakumar&#146;s friends met him 
  on <st1:date Month="4" Day="18" Year="2009" w:st="on">18<sup>th</sup> April 
  2009</st1:date> to discuss escape. It was agreed that each would take his chance 
  as it comes as others also had families. Early morning on 19<sup>th</sup> April, 
  Balakumar&#146;s family got into a boat having about 20 people in Putumattalan 
  and sailed in a southerly direction maintaining that they were moving to Mullivaykkal. 
  The idea was to move slowly to Mullivaykkal and then make a dash for Pulmoddai. 
  When the boatman revved up the engine to make a dash, an LTTE patrol boat spotted 
  them. It caught up and opened fire. The two who fired were very young boys.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>Mahilini&#146;s left arm was fractured near the shoulder and 
  another lady had a slight injury. The boat went ashore. The next day the Army 
  entered Putumattalan and some of Balakumar&#146;s friends went out. There was 
  no treatment for Mahilini at Mullivaykkal. Indrani left for Pulmoddai on the 
  first ICRC ship to call at Mullivaykkal on 23<sup>rd</sup> April. She is now 
  heart broken that she left her husband and son.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>Balakumar and Sooriyatheepan stayed with relatives north of 
  Mullivaykkal. On the 16<sup>th</sup> May, the LTTE allowed the people to go. 
  Like many others who were to the north, they went towards the 53<sup>rd</sup> 
  Division near Irattaivaykkal, along the Nanthikadal Lagoon. On the 17<sup>th</sup> 
  May morning, just after <st1:time Hour="7" Minute="0" w:st="on">7.00 AM</st1:time>, 
  the party was a short distance away from the Army. A soldier asked those who 
  had been in the LTTE to first come forward. Sick as he was, Balakumar went forward 
  and identified himself. An officer was called. He spoke to Balakumar politely 
  and shook hands. Encouraged by this cordiality, Balakumar said that he had his 
  son. </span></p>
<p>The officer asked him to fetch him. Balakumar returned with his son Sooriyatheepan, 
  who had nothing to do with the LTTE, and an LTTE cadre Aingaran who wanted to 
  surrender. As far as the people could see, Balakumar was treated well. A tractor-trailer 
  was brought and Balakumar was helped to lie down inside and the three were taken 
  away. The rest of the party who had gone with them, then surrendered. There 
  has been no word of Balakumar or the other two since then (see Sec.15). </p>

<p><b><span lang=EN-US>Bearing Witness: Komathy</span></b></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>We return to the experience of the retired lady teacher Komathy 
  introduced earlier. On the 15<sup>th</sup> the LTTE started to set fire to all 
  their vehicles and weaponry. The fires were raging for 3 or 4 days. By the 17<sup>th</sup> 
  night the raging fires, aided by the Army&#146;s firing of burn missiles, had 
  spread into the civilian shelters and caused pandemonium. Until this point the 
  people who had remained had believed that the &#145;boys&#146; would not allow 
  the troops in. But once the fires were lit, many fled. Survivors have related 
  tragic stories such as, a mother having to escape with her children through 
  raging fires, without having the opportunity to look back at what became of 
  her husband. The retired lady teacher Komathy remained because of her crippled 
  niece, still hoping that when the troops come in, they could surrender to them.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>As the troops advanced, the Tigers also fired back from among 
  the 30 000 or so people still remaining. There was hardly enough space to distinguish 
  between a civilian zone and a battleground, resulting in many deaths in the 
  fierce cross fire. The LTTE seemed to be using their ammunition generously in 
  what was their last battle.</span></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>Komathy confirms the generous use of burn shells and cluster 
  shells, the latter familiar to civilians by their drumming noise, and had seen 
  many perish, having their bodies badly broken up. The burn shells, according 
  to persons who were there, burns objects within a given radius. Typically, one 
  would leave a charred circle if it fell on grass. </span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>Komathy was lying in their tent as she found the heat and 
  stifling sweat in the bunker unbearable One man who had been fleeing with his 
  family in the deep hours of the night in consequence of intense fire from advancing 
  troops, and was helping his children into a bunker, was hit by shrapnel as he 
  was stooping to lift up his child lying next to the lady teacher. He fell over 
  her as he died. The lady too was hit by shrapnel which penetrated her shoulder. 
  Being a diabetic, she has so far not attempted to remove it by surgery. </span></p>
<p>Komathy was camped with many others who were perishing in great numbers in 
  the cross fire &#150; both sides took no account of the civilians&#146; presence. 
  They finally made a westward dash for the Nanthikadal lagoon, in the wee hours 
  of the morning. At this time the troops moving in a southerly direction were 
  about quarter mile away. With her son&#146;s help they found a tractor, put 
  her crippled niece into it and trekked to the lagoon, which they crossed and 
  surrendered to the Army. </p>
<p>She thus managed to escape with her son, her daughter-in-law and four children 
  as well as a senior niece of who had been a long time cripple. The latter was 
  the main reason why she stayed on till late. She had been awaiting a suitable 
  tractor leaving the place to transport her niece. </p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>There was no uniform manner in which civilians attempted their 
  escape. They tried all ways and means, moving a short distance, taking cover 
  and moving again. Some went west across Nanthikadal to Kepapulavu, some hugged 
  the Nanthikadal coast southwards and used a float to reach Mullaitivu. Some 
  hugged the east coast to Vattuvakal and crossed the water near the bridge to 
  Mullaitivu and some came along the main road. Several persons who went towards 
  Nanthikadal found countless putrefying dead bodies all over, killed either by 
  army shelling or shot by the LTTE while trying to escape.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>Muhunthan later met in hospital a person who escaped with 
  five injuries on his body at the last stages. When this person was injured, 
  another from his village, Mallavi, had gone to pick him up, when he was cut 
  down by a shell blast. About 300 persons gathered at the school that had been 
  <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Mullivakkal</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Hospital</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> 
  and surrendered to the Army.</span></p>
<p>Those who were too scared or too weak to run away remained in their bunkers. 
  The Army surrounded the area at dawn. Those who survived the shelling, close 
  range fighting and indiscriminate fire by both sides were, in several testimonies, 
  called out by the Army, prior to being dispatched to IDP camps. </p>
<p>A religious leader, who had left the NFZ earlier, later talked to many civilians 
  who had been in the NFZ until the last. The soldiers they saw looked fierce 
  and unearthly like men out of the grave. One family had been moving to Vattuvakal 
  on 18<sup>th</sup> May, after the main fighting had ended. Suddenly they heard 
  bursts of gun fire behind them and the sounds of victims screaming. </p>
<p class=ecxmsonormal style='background:white'><span lang=EN-US
style='color:#444444'>Those who were too scared or too weak to run away remained 
  in their bunkers. The Army came near at dawn on the 18<sup>th</sup> but did 
  not enter the area where the Tigers were last holed up. Perhaps they finally 
  thought of the civilians or were afraid of any remaining suicide bombers. The 
  Army surrounded the area and left an opening towards Irattaivaykkal for the 
  people to come out. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p class=ecxmsonormal style='background:white'><b><span lang=EN-US style='color:#444444'>Bearing 
  Witness: Thavamany</span></b></p>
<p class=ecxmsonormal style='background:white'><span
lang=EN-US style='color:#444444'>Rajaratnam&#146;s mother Thavamany, with her 
  married sister and her husband, had remained in a bunker to the south of Mullivaykkal, 
  and hence were a little cut off from those who were exiting to the north. Her 
  85-year-old father, who remained a strong man to the last, helping in chores 
  like chopping firewood, had died of natural causes. Her unmarried sister and 
  the children who were with them had left earlier. Thavamany and the other two 
  stayed in a bunker with a vehicle parked over it with sand piled around, which 
  made it relatively safe except for a direct hit. When it was thought safe, Thavamany 
  crawled out, lit a fire without exposing herself too much and made tea. Shells 
  continuously fell around them until 19<sup>th</sup> May. There were also gun 
  shots from the remaining LTTE cadres.</span><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Tahoma&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;
color:#444444'></span></p>
<p class=ecxmsonormal style='background:white'><span
lang=EN-US style='color:#444444'>Those who survived the shelling, close range 
  fighting and indiscriminate fire by both sides were inside their bunkers. The 
  Army moved in very cautiously, breaking up the area into boxes, and calling 
  out the people from each box. However, many of those in the boxes felt too frightened 
  to come out, not knowing the Army&#146;s intentions. A man who was Thavamany&#146;s 
  relative was in a bunker when the Army called. He remained inside and after 
  some time peeped out, when a soldier saw him and shot him dead. The soldiers 
  were later apologetic to the rest of the family. &nbsp;</span><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Tahoma&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;
color:#444444'></span></p>
<p class=ecxmsonormal style='background:white'><span
lang=EN-US style='color:#444444'>On 19<sup>th</sup> May, Thavamany heard explosions 
  close by and fires which made their bunker extremely warm. They gathered that 
  the surviving injured LTTE cadres, possibly with others not injured, were committing 
  suicide by blasting themselves. The cadres knew from experience that if they 
  tried to surrender they would not be spared. Thavamany witnessed a huge fire. 
  The next day, 20<sup>th</sup> May, when the surroundings were eerily quiet, 
  Thavamany led the rest and walked south towards the Mullaitivu end. The soldiers 
  expressed surprise, but accepted their explanation for the delay and let them 
  through. </span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:

<p class=ecxmsonormal style='background:white'><span
lang=EN-US style='color:#444444'>Thavamany was too far south to see army vehicles 
  running over bunkers. But she said that the shelling had been very intense until 
  19<sup>th</sup> May. From messages passed between bunkers in her area, she estimates 
  that about 150 persons were killed by shelling in her vicinity. All those who 
  were in Mullivaykkal at the latter end that we have spoken to, are agreed that 
  countless deaths occurred during these days while the Army and LTTE were slinging 
  it out at one another with no concern for the people. Odd testimonies coming 
  from the security forces confirm that the area was awash with dead bodies.&nbsp;&nbsp;

  Some Vital Questions of Humanitarian Law and Ethics</font></span></a></h1>
<p><span lang=EN-US>We have pointed out before that what the State inflicted on 
  the civilians, particularly at Mullivaykkal, not only borders on wanton crime, 
  but also has no justifiable political or military basis. The LTTE was broken 
  and the resistance it offered was no more than a last gasp of a dying organism. 
  We learn from the authors of <i>Vanni Experience</i> (the <i>Kalachchuvadu</i> 
  article) who are from a left background, but served the LTTE in a cultural capacity 
  with deep reservations, that dissent was strong even amongst the leadership. 
  Sea Tiger Leader Soosai had walked out of the last leaders&#146; meeting disagreeing 
  with Prabhakaran. Pottu Amman too felt that military resistance was doomed and 
  wanted another way out, but did not confront Prabhakaran openly as Soosai had 
  done.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>Some of Balakumar&#146;s friends said that during the year 
  leading to the LTTE&#146;s defeat, he was so disillusioned that he saw the continuance 
  of the LTTE leadership as a grave liability for the Tamils. Many persons with 
  dissident views found in Balakumar a source of moral support. Because of his 
  personal rapport with Prabhakaran, he wrote to him regularly. Some who saw these 
  letters told Balakumar that the issues are so serious and he was writing in 
  the polite and restrained manner of a social exchange. Balakumar explained that 
  if anyone tells Prabhakaran anything he would reject it out of hand. One needed 
  to work on him gently so that he would feel the change as coming from him. However, 
  in one of his final letters, Balakumar had told Prabhakaran that history would 
  have no room for him.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>The dissidents who were close to Balakumar felt that although 
  their camp was increasing in numbers, there was little they could do while the 
  leadership controlled the army and the intelligence service. They hoped that 
  with addition of numbers to the dissident camp, there would be slow erosion 
  of the structures of control. </span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>We pointed out in Special Report No.32 that the state-owned 
  newspaper Divaina reported that several LTTE leaders surrendered to the Army 
  at the end of the war. Among them were <span
style='color:black'>Yogaratnam Yogi, Lawrance Thilakar and V. Balakumar. Nothing 
  more has been heard about them. We have given above, eyewitness testimony on 
  Balakumar&#146;s surrender, along with his innocent son and a nephew.</span></span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US style='color:black'>We also said in Special Report No.32 that 
  several senior leaders including Prabhakaran and Soosai were killed after surrender 
  on 17<sup>th</sup> May. The sources quoted in that report and the circumstantial 
  evidence given here suggest that there was a surrender deal which the Government 
  dishonoured. Moreover, the political wing leaders including Nadesan, Pulidevan 
  and many others had wanted to surrender on the 18<sup>th</sup> May morning.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN style='color:black;'>Kohona told the<span class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span><i>Independent,</i> 
  he had learnt from troops then present in the field that Nadesan &amp; co were 
  shot by LTTE cadres who learned of their attempt to escape, adding, &#145;<i>this 
  is consistent with their behaviour&#146;</i>. The same day the<span
class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span><i>Daily Mirror<span
class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></i>quoted Kohona pointing in a contradictory 
  direction: &#147;</span><i><span lang=EN-US style='color:black'>The LTTE wanted 
  to surrender their arms a little too late</span></i><span
lang=EN-US style='color:black'>&#148;.</span><span
lang=EN style='color:black;'>&nbsp;The latter seems to imply that the leaders 
  were killed because of their failure to surrender in time. Notably, the Defence 
  Ministry (defence.lk 18<sup>th</sup> May), far from claiming that the LTTE killed 
  its leaders, merely reported that their bodies had been found. </span><span></span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US style='color:black'>High level contacts, involving the President, 
  senior government figures and Foreign Ministry Secretary Dr. Palitha Kohona, 
  had advised the leaders to go with a white flag and surrender to the Army. They 
  were all reportedly killed. Kohona&#146;s final message to the political leaders 
  through the ICRC was, </span><span lang=EN-US>&#147;<i>Just walk across to the 
  troops, slowly! With a white flag and comply with instructions carefully. The 
  soldiers are nervous about suicide bombers</i>.&#148; Kohona surely said this 
  after contacting the Defence Ministry and that is where the problem begins. 
  Killing those who came to surrender has the appearance of being premeditated, 
  as with the undermining of a surrender agreement.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>Almost everyone in the LTTE who could speak with some authority 
  on surrender talks between the Government and the LTTE has been killed or silenced 
  by some other means. There is little that could be said in defence of the LTTE 
  leaders after the manner in which they treated the people. A government cannot 
  descend to the level of criminals even in dealing with criminals. The Government 
  and a country lose their dignity and legitimacy when they subject anyone who 
  is defenceless to barbarous treatment. It is also a loss to the Tamils, because 
  they needed to question and hear their errant leaders and hold them accountable 
  as part of rediscovering their soul. The Government has instead created conditions 
  for the leaders to re emerge among an alienated people as potent figures of 
  mythology.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>In Balakumar&#146;s case, he was a political person and there 
  are no criminal charges against him. The laws of the land do not permit anyone 
  to be detained indefinitely without sanction from a court of law and it is now 
  more than 180 days. Persons from detainee families have told us that families 
  now have access to most LTTE cadres who surrendered. But in about 25% of the 
  cases there is no word about them despite numerous appeals having been made.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>In Balakumar&#146;s case his surrender to an officer of the 
  53<sup>rd</sup> Division near Irattaivaikkal, along with his son, was witnessed. 
  We hold Major General Kamal Guneratne, former army commander, Lt. Gen. Sarath 
  Fonseka, defence secretary Gotabhaya Rajapakse and President Rajapakse, directly 
  answerable to the country for the safety of Balakumar and his son. They owe 
  it to the families of all those who surrendered to provide access or be answerable 
  for their loved ones. The country must make it clear to those who command institutional 
  force that they are not above the law. </span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-GB>From the survivors we would hear a variety of stories and 
  many tragedies. They would all have one thing in common &#150; it was a miracle

<p><span lang=EN-GB>We give below the story of one individual for whom death and 
  life have become so intermingled, an experience for which words are inadequate. 
  It is enriched by the fact that he did not have a family, but went about, anxious 
  to help victims where he could. We relate the experiences the way they were 
  told:</span></p>
<p><i><span lang=EN-GB>After the fall of Killinochchi, the people were on the 
  run moving eastwards and lost contact with one another. During mid-January I 
  went on my motorcycle to Piramandal Aru (River) east of Visuamadu looking for 
  one of my friends. I inquired at a house in which the man was seated on a chair 
  outside, while his wife, aged about 45, was cooking. There were two other young 
  women there. When I inquired from the man he directed me to a place nearby where 
  about 50 men and women had taken shelter. Since I used kerosene as fuel, it 
  was taking me time to start my motorcycle. Being instinctively alert, no sooner 
  upon faintly hearing the hum of an oncoming shell, I jumped into a nearby pit 
  and immediately heard an explosion. When I raised myself and looked, I observed 
  that the shell had struck the ground between the legs of the man who was sitting. 
  No trace of him was visible. The two young women were also killed. The woman 
  who was cooking was screaming in pain. She was aware that her legs had been 
  blown off. Blood was mixed with the curry she had been preparing. She pleaded 
  with me not to leave her in that condition and to take her to a hospital. The 
  nearest field hospital was in Udayarkattu. Her life was ebbing away and she 
  knew it. I was helpless. The least I could do was to be with her. Within a few 
  minutes, she was gone.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span lang=EN-GB>I had moved to the church in Iranapalai. During February, 
  the Kfirs came on a bombing raid. I got into a bunker. A little later a 1000 
  kg delay bomb fell about 15 feet from my bunker and penetrated the ground. I 
  found myself rocked roughly like a baby in a cradle. Fortunately, this bomb 
  failed to explode. Later the LTTE came and dismantled it to extract about 600 
  kg of explosive.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span lang=EN-GB>A few days later I was with some friends in a house at 
  Anandapuram. When Kfir bombers arrived, I wanted to join some others moving 
  into an open field, where there was also a cemetery, between Iranapalai and 
  Anandapuram. The reason for moving into the open field was a surmise that the 
  pilots would see we are civilians and leave us alone. But a friend of mine restrained 
  me. The bomber dropped &#145;air bombs&#146; (bombs that explode above the surface) 
  in the field, killing about 15 of those who had gone there for safety.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span lang=EN-GB>About the same time a delay bomb (1 ton or 1000 kg) fell 
  on a temple close by. I saw a goat, a man, a mat and some cooking utensils being 
  thrown above the height of a cocoanut tree.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span lang=EN-GB>During my stay at Iranapalai, there were huge casualties 
  due to aerial bombing and shelling. When a settlement was bombed on 16<sup>th</sup> 
  February, some of us got hold of vehicles and went to rescue the survivors. 
  Because the bombing of an area is frequently followed by artillery shelling 
  or a return of the bombers themselves, the vehicle drivers refused to go near 
  the settlement and parked about 150 yards away.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span lang=EN-GB>The victims were mainly women and children who had stayed 
  at home when the men went out to earn their bread doing jobs like constructing 
  bunkers. These bombs when exploding use the ambient oxygen for combustion creating 
  a vacuum, resulting instantly in a powerful blast of wind. The blast wrenches 
  at the clothes and renders them in tatters, leaving the injured women partially 
  exposed. Several girls had stayed together in a bunker to avoid conscription 
  gangs. The blast covered the bunker killing all of them. In a bid to avoid the 
  disrespect of touching the bodies of the women, we had to place them on sacks 
  or sheets, rush them into the van staying at a distance and get back.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span lang=EN-GB>One experience that left a heartrending impression on me 
  was a young girl of 16 or 17 whose legs were blown off. As I was passing, she 
  gripped my legs and pleaded with me to take her. She was supported by a rafter 
  of cocoanut wood and had not realised that her legs were gone. I could see the 
  bones sticking out. Before I could take in what happened, she asked me insistently, 
  &#147;If I were your sister, would you leave me here?&#148; I have no sisters, 
  although I wish I had. I was dumbstruck. She soon passed away.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span lang=EN-GB>Another girl came running towards us shouting that some 
  terrible thing has happened. She neither showed any signs of injury nor awareness 
  of such. To my astonishment, the girl who was running normally, collapsed 10 
  metres away from me and died. When I went close and examined her, I noticed 
  that a piece of shrapnel had struck the back of her head and she did not know 
  it. I figure that about 25 mainly women were killed in the incident. I don&#146;t 
  know the exact number because I had gone as part of a rescue team and not to 
  count. I also saw others who had come independently of us also taking away the 
  injured.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span lang=EN-GB>Subsequently, when I was in the NFZ by the sea, staying 
  out in the open became risky with shells exploding and bullets flying, whose 
  sound could be heard only upon their whizzing past. But for one reason or another, 
  we had to travel along the main road running through the length of the NFZ, 
  especially on rainy days. This road merges with the A 35 near Irattaivaykkal 
  and its northern part where the people were staying is generally close to the 
  lagoon. Valaignarmadam was marginally more dangerous, because the ground was 
  <span class=GramE>raised,</span> giving the soldiers across the lagoon a clear 
  view and they regularly took pot shots at road users. One was thus better advised 
  to use the secondary road from Putumattalan to Valaignarmadam that is closer 
  to the sea. But when it rains the secondary road becomes inundated, and if one 
  must travel, there was no choice but to take one&#146;s chance on the main road.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span lang=EN-GB>I was on my motorcycle going through this area behind a 
  couple on a motorcycle. The woman was pregnant and they were out probably to 
  do some shopping. The couple was coming fast. They signalled to me and I moved 
  aside to let them overtake. I suddenly saw the couple fall down for no discernible 
  reason and the man writhing in agony. He had been hit by a bullet from the army&#146;s 
  side. I stopped and the pregnant woman pleaded with me to take her husband to 
  the hospital. Most people passed us by engrossed in their own problems and such 
  things had become a daily occurrence. The man whose lower jaw had been blown 
  off was vomiting blood and the situation looked hopeless. What had happened 
  was that when we passed that area on motorbikes, it was our custom to dip our 
  heads as low as possible to minimise our chances of being hit by an army sniper. 
  Because the man had ridden fast and taken a curve in overtaking me, he lacked 
  the balance to dip his head as a precaution.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span lang=EN-GB>The stricken man&#146;s wife was helpless. To carry the 
  man to the medical post at Valaignarmadam required a third person on the bike 
  so that the injured man could be sandwiched between us. My bike being too small 
  for that, I asked the wife to help the man onto the bike so that he could sit 
  behind leaning his head on my back. In this manner I took the man to the hospital. 
  By the time I reached there he was dead. It was then that I noticed my own state. 
  A good part of my person was drenched in blood and covered in flies. The flies 
  formed also a thick layer upon the dead man. This brought home to me the absolute 
  squalor of the place.</span></i></p>
<p><i>I was once travelling on the main road when unexpectedly I saw an RPG shell 
  fired by a soldier across the lagoon landing in front of me. I considered and 
  decided that there was no point in stopping and rode on and another RPG shell 
  fell behind me. I warned people travelling in the opposite direction not to 
  proceed as there was an ambush waiting. But no one seemed to take notice. <b>How 
  does one explain such behaviour? On the one hand there is constant danger from 
  shelling and from small weapons fire and ideally children should be inside bunkers. 
  But on the other, you see children playing on the beach and even flying kites, 
  indifferent to sudden death that strikes unawares. </b></i></p>
<p><i><span lang=EN-GB>Children could not be kept long inside bunkers and when 
  they went out it was a time of grave anxiety with bullets flying about. Also 
  in April, I saw a mother crying inconsolably over the body of her child. The 
  child had been missing. When she found her child it was a corpse four days old.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span lang=EN-GB>On 8<sup>th</sup> April I was nearby at Pokkanai, when 
  the Army fired a barrage of shells, causing over a dozen deaths and scores of 
  injuries among people in a queue with children below three years, whose presence 
  was needed to collect packets of milk powder being distributed. What struck 
  me most was the sight of a mother who was herself injured, clutching her dead 
  child and crying.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span lang=EN-GB>On 20<sup>th</sup> April, when the Army entered the NFZ, 
  the Pokkanai area was severely shelled. I went there in the morning with a friend 
  who was searching for his family. Earlier I had seen a prominent white phosphorous 
  flame. As I got nearer, I saw people with burns dipping themselves in the sea. 
  Hundreds had died in the shelling.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span lang=EN-GB>During the first week of May, I was in Mullivaykkal. There 
  was no day we were free from shelling. I had a friend staying in a house close 
  to the sea with his wife, whose leg had been fractured by a shell blast and 
  also had an injury in his arm. He had a lap top computer which he used to pass 
  time. I occasionally collected his computer and had its battery charged at a 
  communication centre, which had a generator. On this day, I had his computer 
  charged and went to his home to deliver it. It was past <st1:time
Hour="19" Minute="0" w:st="on">7.00 PM</st1:time>. </span></i></p>
<p><i><span lang=EN-GB>A nurse from the hospital was there to dress my friend&#146;s 
  wounds. Because she was dealing with a man, her father, had accompanied her. 
  He was seated on a chair, while the others were on the ground. The father got 
  up and offered me his chair. I declined. My friend&#146;s wife asked me to stay 
  and have a cup of plain tea. I excused myself saying it was time for my dinner.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span lang=EN-GB>As I was walking away, within a few seconds, I heard the 
  noise of a single shell being fired. That was deceptive. The Army had a timing 
  device which fired several shells simultaneously, although the noise suggested 
  it was one shell. I was barely 10 metres from the house and I heard an explosion. 
  I received what seemed like a thundering slap. I was thrown down and also someone&#146;s 
  severed leg that was cast up in the air by the explosion fell upon me. I fell 
  wondering whether my hands and legs were intact. I felt pain, but upon feeling 
  about I realised that I had come to no harm. My thoughts immediately went to 
  the folk in the house I had just left.</span></i></p>
<p><i>The shell had fallen between me and the house. Going back, I saw the nurse&#146;s 
  father still sitting on the chair sans his head, as though he had been decapitated. 
  The others were unharmed. Upon seeing me, my friend, disregarding his injured 
  leg, walked up to me and hugged me saying he was worried if I had been blown 
  to bits by the shell blast. The strain caused a relapse in his injured leg. 
  The severed leg had come from the man next door, who had squatted in front of 
  the house trying to tune his wireless set. He was dead. </i></p>
<p><i><span lang=EN-GB>On 8<sup>th</sup> May I witnessed a queue of hungry young 
  persons waiting for patties being shelled after being spotted by a &#145;vandu&#146; 
  (beetle or UAV), leaving more than a dozen mostly children dead. </span></i></p>
<p><i><span lang=EN-GB>In the days that followed there was hardly any food. People 
  were dying all over and were hardly in their bunkers. They stopped caring about 
  living. They wanted to get out or die. The Hospital at Mullivaykkal stopped 
  functioning due to a lack of medicines and the staff too did not have the peace 
  to work. At such hazardous times when sudden death is imminent, people generally 
  choose to stay close to their family, so that if death strikes they all go together. 
  They cannot bear separation. </span></i></p>
<p><i><span lang=EN-GB>The cadres had little choice. Even if they were injured, 
  the choice was to fight on or die. The prospect of medical care and hospitalisation 
  did not exist. I saw for the first time and have no wish to see again, dogs, 
  themselves hungry, carrying parts of human flesh from the multitude of bodies 
  strewn around and left unattended. The whole area exuded the stench of death 
  and hell&#146;s drum beat of falling shells.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span lang=EN-GB>On the 15<sup>th</sup> night, I with some others walked 
  towards the lagoon to find a place to sleep. Property rights to bunkers had 
  expired, and people were constantly edging south. They dared not go northwards 
  as troops there had suffered heavy casualties and they feared how they would 
  be treated. Some of us found an abandoned bunker. We got inside and dug about 
  a little to expand the space. My hand encountered the hands and legs of a dead 
  infant and the bloodied head of a dead woman. It seemed that a shell had fallen 
  into the bunker and killed its occupants.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span lang=EN-GB>On 16<sup>th</sup> May evening, as people were moving out, 
  I saw a sight that moved me with deep sadness and guilt. The hospital was no 
  more. Injured cadres, many of them young girls, with no family at hand, were 
  laid out on the sides of the road near Vattuvakal. The ICRC that was to fetch 
  them was evidently not permitted. They screamed for someone to take them or 
  to give them cyanide. These cadres were very young and they were not sufficiently 
  developed to understand the world around them and the nature of their fate. 
  Their organisation should never have allowed them to suffer in this manner. 
  </span></i></p>
<p><i><span lang=EN-GB>In the night I desperately looked for a place to sleep 
  as I had not slept for three days. I saw a man covered by a mat lying down under 
  a tractor, whom I took to be the owner. Since there was space, I asked for permission 
  to sleep there. I took his silence for consent and spent the night next to him. 
  To my consternation I noticed in the morning that the man was covered with congealed 
  blood and had been dead about two days.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span lang=EN-GB>I walked in the morning with the people who were moving 
  south. As we advanced soldiers from the 59<sup>th</sup> Division going north 
  passed us on the other side of the road. There was no exchange of fire. On getting 
  to Vattuvakal close to Mullaitivu, the soldiers warned us not to get off the 
  road since the sides may be mined. One man who was in a hurry, left the road 
  to overtake us. There was an explosion just ahead of me. The man lost a leg 
  so near to safety. We were well received by the Army at that point and were 
  given water. We were promised a new spring in our lives.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span lang=EN-GB>That was the point where the Government could have won 
  over the people by treating them like citizens and ensuring their speedy return 
  to normal life. In confining them to the squalor of &#145;welfare centres&#146;, 
  for what seemed an interminable length of time, the Government had failed.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span lang=EN-GB>Months later, enjoying a kind of twilight freedom, I went 
  to a temple. While standing there, a well of tears long confined flowed freely, 
  as though something in me had given way without the slightest warning. I almost 
  died several times, and unbelievably was among the living. We had passed through 
  death, and life would never be the same again. That experience would always 
  bind me to the people who suffered with me. It has given me a new lease of energy 
  and determination to work for their well being.</span></i></p>
