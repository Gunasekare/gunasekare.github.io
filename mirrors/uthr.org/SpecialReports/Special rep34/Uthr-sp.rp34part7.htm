<p><span lang=EN-GB>The war, its end and aftermath has left us all with a task 
  of reckoning. This is not a task just for the Sri Lankan Government, or the 
  Sinhalese in whose name it acted, or for those who supported the LTTE from the 
  privilege of exile (who are to a great extent responsible for the misery of 
  their fellows). It is also the duty of those of us within the Tamil community 
  who opposed the LTTE&#146;s politics and practices, and who tried to expose 
  what it was doing to the people in the name of liberation.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>We, and others who share our views, too are imbued with a 
  sense of failure. We might say that our analysis was correct on where the LTTE&#146;s 
  brand of politics would inevitably carry the people and that its end would be 
  catastrophic. But then what is the virtue in having been right?</span></p>
<p>We protested when the LTTE was in the early 1990s filling up its prisons with 
  dissidents, many of them of the highest character and commitment, and was exterminating 
  thousands of them to keep the people in the dark about what it was doing to 
  Tamil society. Some called us liars, and many others found us interesting. But 
  nothing was done to stop it. Soon many international NGOs caught the peace bug 
  and did not want to touch the LTTE&#146;s human rights record, while not disputing 
  what we said about what the Government was doing. The peace bug was so potent 
  that this lobby managed to shift the blame on to President Kumaratunge when 
  she talked peace in early 1995 and the LTTE started war, after using talks to 
  stock up petrol and cement and getting the Army to vacate Pooneryn.</p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>We protested similarly when a large bandwagon followed cheering 
  the Norwegian peace process, seeing in it as a brilliant stroke, while ignoring 
  the LTTE&#146;s unremitting conscription of children and continuous killing 
  of dissidents using the access provided by the peace process. Those who shared 
  our views were rebuffed and in the predictable course of things, Sinhalese extremism, 
  which too consistently criticised the process for its own reasons, attained 
  the upper hand. People who were genuinely concerned about protecting the rights 
  of the Tamil people and wanted to find a political settlement in the South, 
  were marginalised<span class=GramE>..</span> The present cataclysm is the result.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>Many people who were critical of the Norwegian process told 
  us we should support the recent war because the Government was getting rid of 
  the LTTE, and were angry that we were instead exposing the violations of the 
  Government. Sadly today, equating dissidence with treachery has become the linchpin 
  of the Government&#146;s war against democracy and the media, just as it was 
  for the LTTE for many years, and with devastating results of Tamil society.</span></p>
<p>We must confess that even as we opposed the ideology of the recent war and 
  the manner in which it was fought, we were not alert enough to the full enormity 
  of the human toll. In retrospect, there were several reasons for this lapse. 
  Estimates of the numbers killed and wounded communicated to us by civilians 
  who were coming out of the war zone were well below figures being cited by the 
  UN and other sources. At the same time we believed that under such enormous 
  international pressure, the Government must show some real concern for the civilians. 
  In this we were proved wrong.</p>
<p>Historically, the abysmal operational standards maintained by the Sri Lankan 
  military have largely gone unchallenged by the international community because 
  so much of the blame for provoking attacks lay with the LTTE. When the Army 
  made its first abortive attempt to overrun Jaffna on 9<sup>th</sup> July 1995, 
  it inundated civilian areas under barrages of shells, fired without any warning 
  and then on the following day bombed the church in Navaly where a large number 
  of refugees had gathered, killing in all nearly 300 men, women and children. 
</p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>There seemed to be something inevitable about the army&#146;s 
  violations, given the manner in which the LTTE had used peace negotiations as 
  a prelude to launching a new round of war. We covered all this and the subsequent 
  disappearances in <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Jaffna</st1:place></st1:City>, but these did not 
  feature in public discourse at the time as war crimes, partly because the Government 
  was then perceived to be intent on a political settlement, while it was the 
  LTTE that was undermining the effort.</span></p>
<p>In 2009 it was different. <span class=GramE>Neither side was talking peace, 
  and</span> neither side cared what happened to civilians who got in the way 
  of their war efforts. The rhetoric of Sinhalese <span
class=SpellE>supremacism</span> with ideological overtones of conquest was being 
  voiced from the highest echelons of power. Attacks on the media, and the continuous 
  slaughter of civilians for several months spread the stink far and wide. The 
  situation was compounded by the way the survivors were treated to suppress the 
  tragedy of the war. </p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>We will now examine if this has anything to do with fighting 
  terrorism.</span></p>
<h1><a name="_Toc248477369"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;

  Dangerous Miscalculations about Terrorism</font></span></a><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'></span></h1>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>Those of us who have grown old with Prabhakaran and Osama 
  bin Laden have a weakness for believing that these gentlemen were the heart 
  and soul of the phenomena of terrorism they represented. It is thus the accepted 
  wisdom that killing such leaders is the key to smashing terrorism. </span></p>
<p><span class=SpellE><span lang=EN-GB>Prabhakaran</span></span> is dead and the 
  jubilant extremist lobby close to the Government views his defeat as the ultimate 
  vindication of their political agenda. They believe the military victory over 
  the LTTE finally buries any argument about the need for a political settlement 
  to the minority question. They have scoffed at it, branding it a liberal illusion 
  detrimental to sovereignty.</p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>This position misses an important point about terrorist phenomena. 
  Terrorism in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Sri Lanka</st1:place></st1:country-region> has 
  a lot to do with the root causes of conflict the Sinhalese extremists deny. 
  Once the flame has been lit, the terrorist potential we see today burns on quite 
  independent of Prabhakaran or bin Laden, or other similar leaders who come and 
  go. It is fed by anger the young feel about perceived injustice and humiliation, 
  and by the absence of a creative leadership with character and direction. </span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>There are different possible responses to oppression. In history 
  we have seen anarchist movements, revolutionary movements and liberation movements, 
  all of which used violent means to fight against oppression. There was a broad 
  spectrum in the ideological make up of these movements. Some were guided by 
  broader principles and succeeded in capturing power. Movements which kept the 
  interest of the people at <span class=GramE>heart,</span> succeeded in fashioning 
  their means to suit changing situations and were not dogmatic about ends. </span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>Broader revolutionary movements at least in principle tried 
  their best to defend the people and while accepting deaths among them as the 
  price of struggle, they tried to minimise them. But movements such as the LTTE, 
  Al <span class=SpellE>Quaida</span> and Taliban have not only have shown scant 
  concern for civilian suffering, but worked towards its maximisation in the belief 
  that civilian suffering could be used to campaign against their perceived enemies. 
  The LTTE institutionalised a nihilistic mindset not only among the cadres but 
  also manipulated the community in such a manner that those who supported its 
  suicidal politics most vocally and bankrolled it, got away from its consequences. 
  Those who were trapped suffered, and were denied means of escape.</span></p>
<p>As recently as 25 years ago, while the Tamils still had democratic freedom 
  among themselves, it was possible to argue out possible strategies of struggle. 
  This resulted in various militant formations &#150; most short-lived. But the 
  overarching impact of Sinhalese and Tamil narrow nationalism, which dominated 
  the political landscape, denied to both the Sinhalese and Tamil communities 
  the ability to be creative in responding to the crisis. So many critical analyses 
  were done about the failure of the political elite in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Sri Lanka</st1:place></st1:country-region> to forge ahead with a political 
  agenda towards identifying a meaningful power sharing mechanism, to undo the 
  legacy of a state that evolved into a &#145;<st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">Sinhala</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">State</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>&#146;, 
  thereby alienating the minorities. But the political elite in all communities 
  miserably failed and not only allowed the ethnic conflict to fester but relied 
  on it to preserve their power. </p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>People naturally support leaders that inspire confidence that 
  the sacrifices they are called upon to make towards the attainment of justice 
  are worthwhile. Mahatma Gandhi did that very successfully against British rule. 
  His character and moral ideals, his single minded dedication and disinterest 
  in power, wealth or security, and his readiness to challenge injustices within 
  <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> that divided 
  the people, served to inspire a high degree of confidence unparalleled in the 
  history of such a diverse nation.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>It is the tragedy of the Tamil people that they did not generate 
  such a leadership. The LTTE was the end result of repeated communal violence 
  and of a Tamil parliamentary leadership increasingly taking refuge in rhetoric<span class=GramE>..</span> 
  And once it gained power, the LTTE systematically wiped out any discussion of 
  alternatives, compromised character among the general public and made the worship 
  of its heroism and unquestioning obeisance the only course open to the Tamils. 
  </span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>Young Tamils were not allowed to see the brutal elimination 
  of dissent in the LTTE&#146;s closed camps or even find out the truth about 
  these &#145;traitors&#146;. To them the brutality of the Sri Lankan military 
  machine was part of their real life experience. Under the constraints of a terrorised 
  society, young people did not have fearless community leaders of character, 
  who could guide them. They only saw the heroism of LTTE cadres, some of whom 
  they might know from school, and this often decided their choice of role models 
  or objects of respect.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>When one talks to young IDPs from the <span class=SpellE>Vanni</span> 
  &#150; a large proportion of <span
class=GramE>whom</span> have lost at least one family member who voluntarily or 
  otherwise fought for the LTTE &#150; one soon realises that they actually have 
  a low opinion of the LTTE leadership. The latter after all put the civilians 
  through enormous suffering and conscripted the unwilling almost to the last, 
  saying no surrender in public, while using third parties to negotiate their 
  safe exit. This however does not mean that the people have rejected the rank 
  and file of the LTTE. </span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>.</span><b><span lang=EN-GB>Even as they reject discredited 
  leaders and their ways, they would continue to admire those who heroically sacrificed 
  their lives. Who else was there for them to look up to whom the LTTE would have 
  spared? They face a moral and political vacuum within their community and outside 
  it they face the arrogance and violence of the State.</span></b></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>It is within this ambience of total despair that they identify 
  individuals whom they admire even when they will not follow them. This too, 
  as illustrated by the two examples below, is indicative of minds on the threshold 
  of suicidal pessimism that is very disturbing in itself. Why should anyone feel 
  that such are the noblest accomplishments in life open to him or her?</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>One example is of a young man caught up in the tail end of 
  the war at <span class=SpellE>Mullivaykkal</span> in May 2009. One day before, 
  he was talking normally. On his final day he packed a motorbike and his person 
  with explosives and rode away to blast himself among the soldiers who had come 
  close. As he went he told a scholar, &#147;<i>I will do my part in trying to 
  stop the oncoming army. I leave it to you to do your part in building up our 
  nation</i>.&#148; </span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>In another terrible story, told to us by a youth who had several 
  friends in the LTTE, an LTTE suicide cadre sent to <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Colombo</st1:place></st1:City> 
  was surrounded by security men. The cadre ran, when he found a bakery. He rushed 
  in and threw himself into the oven, from where his remains were recovered. He 
  evidently did this so that nothing of his person or form would remain by which 
  he could be identified and his links traced. In some way their whole existence 
  had been absorbed into the cause of Tamil Eelam.</span></p>
<p>To be sure, the situation we find ourselves in has a good deal to do with how 
  the LTTE managed society, pushed for war whenever there was a prospect of peace 
  and brainwashed the community through its propaganda monopoly. It also has 
  a good deal to do with how the State has conducted itself. And expatriate LTTE 
  supporters who basked in this vicarious glory are deserving of the highest contempt. 
  Yet one is called upon to understand the state of mind of those who sacrificed 
  their lives in this manner believing that it was to uphold their people&#146;s 
  dignity. This state of mind also extends to a significant segment of the IDP 
  community.</p>
<p>The IDPs first came out of the LTTE-controlled Vanni castigating the LTTE in 
  the strongest terms. As their bitterness became more pronounced in the face 
  of prolonged incarceration, even some women with strong religious views against 
  violence began saying that they would have been better off had they fought with 
  the LTTE and died. Presently among many IDPs, we have found a tendency to <span class=SpellE>rationalise</span> 
  what the LTTE did to them. Several people have said to us that the LTTE got 
  a large number of them killed, hoping that the high civilian death toll would 
  impel intervention by a longed for foreign <span class=SpellE>saviour</span>, 
  whom many identified with Uncle Obama.</p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>Unfortunately, an influential section of the Sinhalese polity 
  appears to believe that the Government has done the right thing, and old dreams 
  have been revived (and vocally) about denying the Tamils any autonomous space 
  by planting Sinhalese colonies and having a permanent repressive presence of 
  the military in their areas. The <span class=SpellE>Weli</span> Oya project 
  of 1984 and the <span class=SpellE>Sampoor</span> coal power plant project are 
  products of this type of thinking. Ideas such as the special economic zone in 
  <span class=SpellE>Trincomalee</span> and a similar arrangement for <span class=SpellE>Killinochchi</span> 
  put forward by the President&#146;s clique; and General <span class=SpellE>Fonseka&#146;s</span> 
  proposal to increase the strength of the peace time army by 100 000 in order 
  to preserve the gains of war, point to such intentions.</span></p>
<p>This is the time the government could have pushed for a genuine reconciliation 
  process to charter a post conflict phase. It would have allowed all the communities 
  to work towards brighter future taking into consideration the failures of the 
  past. But the present regime with its vision no broader than consolidating of 
  power of a family, is using the war victory to suppress the truth, not only 
  what happened during the last stages of the war, but also the decades-long wounds 
  that culminated in the war.</p>
<p><span></span>The opposition which rhetorically talks about the rights of the 
  Tamil community is more interested in capturing power at any cost than seriously 
  pondering its failures for allowing the situation to deteriorate to the present 
  level of despair. </p>

'></span></h1>
<p><span lang=EN-US>One marvels at the singular lack of originality and creativeness 
  in the Sinhalese polity, which poses real questions for the Sinhalese. The medicines 
  that have been repeatedly applied to the minority question have the major ingredients 
  in common. In the late 1950s and 1977, communal violence was advanced as a cure 
  for unwarranted political demands by the Tamils. In the 1950s it was used to 
  quell resistance to the Sinhala Only policy and the federal demand, and in 1977 
  it was unleashed because the Tamils had shown strong support at elections for 
  a party advocating a separate state. There was no serious attempt to address 
  the legitimate political grievances that drove these demands, only to silence 
  them.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>In July 1983, President Jayewardene, as indicated in his <i>Daily 
  Telegraph</i> interview a few days before the violence and in Minister <span class=SpellE>Athulathmudali&#146;s</span> 
  statement in Parliament on the eve of the violence, viewed communal violence 
  as a way of countering Tamil terrorism by destroying once and for all any notion 
  of a Tamil Homeland, a victory he then consolidated by planting military-backed 
  Sinhalese settlements in their areas.</span></p>
<p>In all these instances, the sight of bereaved Tamils who had lost their possessions 
  being cast into the abject humiliation of refugee camps was a sign of triumph 
  for advocates of the violence. Many other people who were uncomfortable with 
  the suffering salved their conscience by peddling stories about Sinhalese saving 
  Tamil friends or <span class=SpellE>neighbours</span> from Sinhalese mobs. But 
  there was no public outcry or a demand to try those behind the violence and 
  punish them. The result was a growing erosion of respect for the rule of law 
  among Sinhalese. And each of these &#145;victories&#146; became a prelude to 
  a major cataclysm.</p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>It also affected institutions that should have been the main 
  hope for uniting the country. One needs to be thankful that in the 1960s and 
  into the 1970s, universities like Peradeniya exuded what one calls, an atmosphere. 
  There were certain things in the category of &#145;not done&#146;. If one showed 
  any trace of communalism in one&#146;s <span class=SpellE>behaviour</span>, 
  one would have been checked by one&#146;s friends or peers. That atmosphere 
  of inclusiveness was to a great extent diminished by the politically backed 
  attack on Tamil students by fellow Sinhalese students affiliated to the UNP 
  in May 1983.</span></p>
<p>It is not necessarily that people in charge of institutions key to ensuring 
  that the communities work together approved of mistreating minorities. Rather, 
  what we have seen is a persistent deterioration of atmosphere, a lack of conviction 
  at the institutional level that such conduct is too dangerous and too degrading 
  to be tolerated Given their repeated experiences of racism (large and small) 
  in most spheres of public life, it becomes hard to blame a Tamil for feeling 
  that a separate state is the answer.</p>
<p>But the LTTE <span class=SpellE>capitalised</span> on such feelings and used 
  them towards totally destructive ends, proving that giving way to such feelings 
  may be worse. </p>
<p>The manner in which the war was fought has resulted in something far, far worse 
  than all the rounds of communal violence put together. The war&#146;s final 
  chapter was accompanied by terrible, chauvinist rhetoric on the part of the 
  country&#146;s leaders, and has ushered in an era of utter impunity for almost 
  unimaginable acts of violence. Tamil civilians were victims of mass killings; 
  those who survived were detained en masse in military-guarded camps; those released 
  became objects of crippling surveillance,</p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>That things would end this way was already hinted at in the 
  public execution of five innocent Tamil students in Trincomalee on <st1:date Year="2006" Day="2" Month="1" w:st="on">2<sup>nd</sup> 
  January 2006</st1:date>, the execution of 17 ACF workers on <st1:date
Year="2006" Day="4" Month="8" w:st="on">4<sup>th</sup> August 2006</st1:date>, 
  followed by threats and intimidation to deny justice. </span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>Numerous statements by the President, cabinet ministers and 
  the former Army Commander Sarath Fonseka taken collectively make it clear that 
  those in power see Lanka as a Sinhalese country where the others exist on the 
  sufferance of the Sinhalese. Euphemisms such as abolishing the term minority 
  and preserving the gains of war taken in context and knowing the aims and history 
  of July 1983 leave no doubt about what the President actually intended. </span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>Isolating beaten and injured Tamils in &#145;welfare <span class=SpellE>centres&#146;</span>, 
  takes us back to the kind of victories exemplified by displacement camps after 
  previous rounds of communal violence. <b>Defeating the LTTE was a legitimate 
  objective, but what has been done to the people goes far beyond anything legitimate. 
  Notionally defeating terrorism must restore the rule of law. In <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Sri 
  Lanka</st1:place></st1:country-region> there are no signs of that happening. 
  There are only signs of a re-enactment of the past and making state terror part 
  of the minorities&#146; day-to-day existence.</b></span></p>

font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;'></span></font></h1>
<p><span lang=EN-US>The prospect facing us at the coming elections should be a 
  wake up call to Lanka&#146;s sons and daughters who care for her future. The 
  voters seem likely to have a choice between persons who have all wallowed in 
  extreme impunity and abused their offices in total contempt for the Constitution 
  and laws of the land. The country then stands to be buffeted in stormy weather 
  until eventually breaking on the rocks.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>There seems little prospect of making the opposition act in 
  a sane manner. One should be able to read the signs in the Tamil Press. At the 
  end of the war the Government could have encouraged the Tamil parties to visit 
  the IDPs, speak freely on behalf of their people and contribute gainfully towards 
  a political settlement. It tried instead to divide and constrain them to toe 
  its line. Only Tamil political leaders completely subservient to it were allowed 
  to visit the IDPs, so as to have a monopoly of their votes. In these circumstances 
  it is TNA spokesmen, who were from parties persecuted and decimated by the LTTE 
  and went under its umbrella for mostly opportunistic reasons, and whose credibility 
  was at a nadir when the war ended, that hog publicity in the Tamil Press. It 
  is the old game that brought about the Tamils terrible tragedy.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>The opposition talks about restoring democracy and Human Rights 
  and yet supports the Army General as the candidate to challenge the President 
  <span class=SpellE>Mahind</span> <span class=SpellE>Rajapakse</span>, although 
  he has shown, if anything scant regard for these. Perhaps they think that by 
  going behind him, they could remove the tag of &#147;anti national forces&#148; 
  bestowed on them by the Rajapakse camp. </span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>The fact that they accepted this tag passively is an admission 
  of their lack of vision, and inability to argue out issues outside the framework 
  of Sinhalese ideology. It is amongst the strangest ironies of the times that 
  Sinhalese Nationalism which boasts itself the guardian of <span class=SpellE>Theravadha</span> 
  Buddhist heritage must do a reverse of Asoka <span class=SpellE>Maurya</span>. 
  </span></p>
<p>Asoka embraced Buddhism as an escape from the trauma and futility with which 
  he was afflicted in consequence of the bloodshed and misery of the <span class=SpellE>Kalinga</span> 
  war. It was Asoka&#146;s missionary zeal that spread Buddhism far and wide, 
  including to <st1:place
w:st="on">South India</st1:place> and Lanka. Today&#146;s Lankan standard bearers 
  of Buddhism, particularly the JHU, use it to justify and cover up, by the foulest 
  means, all the defilements of the Vanni war and much that preceded it. Even 
  worse, the supporters of the presidential contestants are fighting each other 
  using Sinhalese Buddhist rhetoric in staking their claim to being the sole agent 
  of victory in the recent war. In doing so they lose sight of the fact that the 
  claim is double edged. The claimants also become prospective owners of war crimes. 
  </p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>Sadly, the tumult and virulence of this election battle would 
  do little to educate the masses on the real tragedy that has befallen us. It 
  denies the Tamils the space to reflect on their recent political legacy, which 
  brought them unmitigated tragedy. The Sinhalese masses would continue to believe 
  that the war was a humanitarian one where the Government <span class=SpellE>minimised</span> 
  the casualties to an extent compatible with the LTTE&#146;s provocations. If 
  the people are allowed to see the enormity of the tragedy on both sides and 
  begin to understand each others&#146; trauma at a human level, the door to reconciliation 
  would open up. And the way to a political settlement offering dignity and security 
  to all also becomes easier. </span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>But political power elites still hang on to partial narratives 
  that reinforce narrow nationalism on both sides. </span></p>
<p>In spite of the constraints of this unhealthy political environment, many activists 
  keep the flame of hope alive by their humanitarian and reconciliation efforts 
  wherever opportunity permits. Moreover, social relations between the communities 
  have not reached an abysmal level where reconciliation is impossible. The Tamils, 
  despite the devastation resulting from years of war, communal violence and the 
  self destructive totalitarianism of the LTTE, have not reached the end of the 
  road. Given a leadership that puts behind the Jaffna <span class=SpellE>centred</span> 
  Tamil nationalism, which contained within it the seeds of totalitarianism, isolationism 
  and the alienation of other minorities, and is able to form imaginative alliances 
  in the spirit of give and take with other minorities; the Tamils could still 
  emerge a powerful voice in the affairs of Lanka. This is quite independent of 
  the Sinhalese polity being able put away fashioning imaginary fears and illusory 
  enemies, continually to undermine a political settlement that would ring in 
  a peaceful and prosperous Lanka. </p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>Genuine reform towards reinvigorating a democratic culture, 
  accountability, good governance, along with a framework that affords political 
  and cultural space for ethnic and religious minorities, cannot begin in the 
  absence of truth. Beyond accepting that something has gone radically wrong, 
  each community must feel and acknowledge its share of guilt for this tragedy, 
  without falling for scapegoats whom politicians are good at procuring. If that 
  happens, those who try to divide the people would stand exposed.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>The issues have long been well understood among activist groups 
  in the South and a number of them have worked tirelessly for reform. Any criticism 
  on our part would immediately strike many of them as unfair. Admittedly, we 
  too have ostensibly failed. It could be said that we were <span class=SpellE>marginalised</span> 
  by LTTE dominance in the North as well as by the dominant nationalism of the 
  South. </span></p>
<p>We might plead one consideration. Several activist groups in the South that 
  advanced the right causes have risked <span
class=SpellE>marginalisation</span> by trying to take short cuts in the face of 
  undoubtedly difficult choices. This happened when they courted the UNP&#146;s 
  <span
class=SpellE>Ranil</span> Wickremasinghe in 1999 on his West-driven idea of appeasement 
  with the LTTE and aided his opportunistic undermining of the political settlement 
  put forward by President Kumaratunge in 2000. </p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>Some people who should have known better were ready to ignore 
  principles, particularly sweeping under the carpet the UNP&#146;s responsibility 
  for August 1977, July 1983 and much that followed. Most grave among the latter 
  was its debasement of the rule of law, which President Rajapakse has carried 
  to new lengths on the pretext of combating the LTTE. It is this dereliction 
  by many well meaning activists in 1999 and 2001 that brought us to the present 
  ascendancy of Sinhalese chauvinism. Once more the UNP which tried to ride, disastrously, 
  the Sinhala Only wave in 1955, is presently trying to ride the ascendancy of 
  chauvinism by means of a dangerous and inflammable shortcut &#150; General Fonseka. 
  </span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>We do know that the failure of civil society in the South 
  to combat the culture of impunity hiding behind national security, and a parallel 
  failure in the North to oppose suicidal nationalism parading as national liberation, 
  reinforced one another. Short cuts that compromise principles have trapped the 
  country in this vicious cycle. They seemed alluring for the moment, but in the 
  end sacrificed the prospects of a happier turn around in the long term.</span></p>
<p><span></span>No doubt anyone who values human rights, the rule of law and 
  democracy would like to see the backs of the arrogance and corruption of the 
  Rajapakse regime. But even at the cost of being left out or <span class=SpellE>marginalised</span>, 
  we should give careful thought to preserving long term options. </p>
