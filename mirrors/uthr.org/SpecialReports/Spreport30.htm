  <p>On 4<sup>th </sup>August 2006 17 aid workers were
    extrajudicially executed in their <i>Action
    Contre la Faim </i>(ACF) compound in Mutur town. Through blatant cover up by
    the Sri Lankan authorities, their experts, Attorney General and diplomats
    overseas the facts of killings have been suppressed along with any potential
    association between this massacre and the killing of five students on the
    Trincomalee foreshore on 2<sup>nd</sup> January 2006. </p>
  <p>With the support of individuals equally interested in bringing
    out the truth and finding justice we have uncovered information that reveals
    that the 17 aid workers were killed by at least one member of the Muslim Home
    Guard (Jehangir) and two police constables (Susantha and Nilantha) in the
    presence of the Sri Lankan Naval Special Forces. Four different types of guns
    were used. Evidence suggests that the killers had prior approval from ASP
    (Sarath Mulleriyawa) and OIC (Chandana Senayake) for their vile enterprise. But
    it is highly unlikely that the ASP and OIC would have taken a reckless approach
    or that they had any particular reason to want the aid workers killed and they
    had earlier received orders from Trincomalee to ensure the safety of the aid
    workers. We believe they may have received an instruction from their superiors
    in Trincomalee (namely the DIG Rohan Abeywardene and SSP Kapila Jayasekere)
    that the aid workers should be killed. The commandos must have been informed by
    their superior to let the killings take place and may be directly responsible
    for firing the bullets that killed at least one of the aid workers. </p>
  <p>SSP Kapila Jayasekere, along with Zawahir (OIC Crime Harbour
    Police, Trincolmalee), is widely known to have been responsible for planning,
    orchestrating and covering up the killing of the five students by STF assassins
    amidst a naval security cordon and hundreds of witnesses, who were part of a
    captive audience. The intimidation of families and witnesses and the killing of
    witnesses and a journalist who pursued the case are well documented. This
    includes the family of Hemachandran, one of the five students killed, in
    particular Hemachandran’s brother, Kodeeswaran. Kodeeswaran had spoken to a
    member of the STF killing team, believed to be VAS Perera its head, who
    answered one of the victims’ mobile telephone just prior to the killing of the
    five students. Kodeeswaran was then systematically harassed by the security
    forces until he was killed in the ACF massacre seven months later. We believe
    that the 17 aid workers would have lived, had disciplinary action been
    instituted against SSP Jayasekere over the killing of the five students.</p>
  <p>The murders of the 17 aid workers and the five students are
    among thousands who have died by violence during the past 26 months. Perhaps we
    know more about these 22 tragedies because of contact with some of the
    families, but the ones we do not know are no less poignant. The stories of
    thousands of young dying and maimed in the Vanni, having been forced to fight
    for the LTTE against their will, remain a closed book until perchance a
    plaintive unsent letter is recovered from a dead cadre. </p>
  <p>These two cases, given also the international interest,
    remain the most promising means of making cracks in the prison of impunity,
    which grips the nation. In the history of crimes of this nature, even when they
    lead to investigation and court proceedings, we are left in the dark about the
    deeper political underpinnings of the crime, instigation at higher levels, the
    thinking behind and motivations, knowledge of which are key to exposure and
    deterrence. </p>
  <p>The country has learnt to be comfortable with grave crimes
    going unpunished one after another, with the certainty that even graver ones
    would follow. <span lang=EN-GB>The answer to
    the question why Sri Lanka is steeped in recurrent gross crimes, especially
    against the minorities, that go unchecked is not far to seek. The rulers
    without good sense or vision would fight hard against command responsibility
    being invoked in judicial practice. This would have been relatively harmless if
    the politicians and security forces were reasonably law abiding. Unfortunately,
    this country is determined to earn the contempt and ridicule of the rest of the
    world.</span></p>
  <p><span lang=EN-GB>For years
    the State has gone on denying, obfuscating, abusing detractors, intimidating or
    killing witnesses and making matters progressively worse. Our envoys like the
    foreign minister, foreign secretary, minister for human rights, Attorney
    General and many more have tried to cover the country’s shame with rhetoric – ‘<i>We
    have our Supreme Court, our judges, our own Police Force, Attorney General,
    forensic pathologists and ballistic experts. We don’t need foreign help in
    investigations that are progressing well</i>’. </span></p>
  <p><span lang=EN-GB>The ACF
    case by itself proves this rhetoric to be empty – not because of local
    incompetence but because of malice. Malice against justice and against the
    minorities. We use the word malice advisedly because it is an unvarying
    condition, with no desire for correction.</span></p>
  <p><span lang=EN-GB>As for the
    Police that was directly responsible for the killing of both the Five Students and
    the ACF staff, it has largely ceased to be a police force. T</span>he Police
    are more involved in perverting the evidence and silencing witnesses than in
    any real investigation. <span lang=EN-GB>In a
    state that has deliberately truncated itself to a Sinhalese State, the Police
    have been increasingly used as its criminal arm.</span></p>
  <p><span lang=EN-GB>The
    hypocrisy about our state institutions has to stop and the fact has to be faced
    that there has now been a long history of justice being out of the reach
    especially of minorities even for sensational crimes that draw world attention. </span></p>
  <p><span lang=EN-GB>It is not
    without great pain that we appeal to the outside world for justice. <s> </s>It abases us and hurts our pride and
    often, for unfair reasons, our self-respect. When we had working institutions
    solving the cases above was routine work. But today the criminality of the very
    institutions that are meant to deliver justice has thrown huge barriers against
    justice and the people are helpless.</span></p>

  <p>The five students were killed by STF assassins amidst a
    naval security cordon and hundreds of witnesses, who were part of a captive
    audience. That was on 2<sup>nd</sup> January 2006, more than two years ago. The
    ACF killings followed seven months later on 4<sup>th</sup> August 2006. These
    make up 22 deaths among thousands who have died by violence during the past 26
    months. The stories of thousands of young dying and maimed in the Vanni, having
    been forced to fight for the LTTE against their will, remain a closed book
    until perchance a plaintive unsent letter is recovered from a dead cadre. </p>
  <p>Perhaps we know more about these 22 tragedies because of
    contact with some of the families, but the ones we do not know are no less
    poignant. Each has its unique story. Most of the dead were ordinary boys and
    girls. Often a tragedy strikes us not in the immediate anguish as in a calm
    commonplace remark by a mother on a peculiar trait of her son, which signals a
    void time cannot heal.</p>
  <p>Narmathan was one of the ACF victims wearing a bath towel at
    the time of his death. The time of the incident had long been a point of
    controversy and it seemed knowledge of the victim’s bathing habits might throw
    light on it. Narmathan’s mother reflected, “<i>He was always bathing, starting
    at five in the morning before he set off to give tuition classes. He would bathe
    at least five times a day</i>.”  </p>
  <p>There is however one pressing reason why these 22 deaths
    remain important. These are from two incidents over which there has been
    enormous international pressure on the Government to find the culprits and
    punish them. Notwithstanding public assurances and the appointment of a
    Commission of Inquiry with a group of eminent persons (IIGEP), the Government
    of Sri Lanka has remained adamant that nothing of significance should come out.
    Every independent attempt to bring out the truth has been met with attack and
    abuse. We have dealt with several instances in our reports and will not repeat
    them here.</p>
  <p>These two cases, given also the international interest,
    remain thus the most promising means of making cracks in the prison of impunity,
    which grips the nation. In the history of crimes of this nature, even when they
    lead to investigation and court proceedings, we are left in the dark about the
    deeper political underpinnings of the crime, instigation at higher levels, the
    thinking behind and motivations, knowledge of which are key to exposure and
    deterrence. </p>
  <p>At the core of these crimes in Sri Lanka is the endemic
    refusal of the rulers to move from criminal responsibility to command
    responsibility. This means that however grave a crime, a few from the lowest
    ranks of the security forces are brought to court for carrying out the wishes
    of their superiors, and inevitably the public feels sorry for them. Thus in the
    Bindunuwewa massacre (Special Report 19 Part I), the High Court passed death
    sentences on two junior officers. A superior of ASP rank who was on the scene
    was not touched and the Supreme Court released those convicted. The country has
    learnt to be comfortable with grave crimes going unpunished one after another,
    with the certainty that even graver ones would follow.</p>
  <p>For these reasons following up the Five Students and ACF
    crimes to their root and bringing out the main institutional and political
    underpinnings is worth every bit of energy we put into the effort. We are certain
    that it would open windows and throw light on other crimes of this nature. This
    report is a follow up on our previous reports. Because of a system where the
    Police are more involved in perverting the evidence and silencing witnesses
    than in any real investigation, we are often reduced to exposing procedural
    aberrations and the intimidation of witnesses. </p>
  <p>As time passes we move on to another case and do the same
    thing. As human rights advocates we are reduced to another bunch of
    entertainers rather than actually help bring out the truth and deter crimes
    against humanity. We could best try to make some real progress in bringing out
    the truth, however long and onerous. First, the ACF case.</p>
  <h1><a name="_Toc192316203"></a><a name="_Toc192316393"></a><a

  <p>Almost everything said on this case by anyone trying to
    bring out the truth has come under fire. The first was the statement by the
    SLMM Head Ulf Henricsson of 30<sup>th</sup> August 2006 blaming the security
    forces. The ICJ came in to observe magistrate’s proceedings and issued two
    reports and several statements. In April 2007 the ICJ merely stated the
    identification by the Australian pathologist Dr. Dodd of a 5.56 mm calibre
    bullet found in the head of victim Miss. Romila Sivapragasam and what it would
    very likely imply. And hell broke loose. This was just one among many
    criticisms the ICJ had made on the conduct of the investigation. In particular
    it faulted the police investigation of proceeding as though the LTTE were the
    perpetrators, virtually ruling out any other possibility.</p>
  <p>The Attorney General in June 2007 tried to prove what Dr.
    Dodd called a 5.56 mm bullet was in fact the core of a 7.62 mm bullet.
    Amazingly, Dr. Dodd went back on his earlier identification on flimsy reasons
    without even demanding from the Government the missing, certified, original
    photograph of the bullet, and unjustifiably tried to shift the controversy on
    to the ICJ, which had in fact relied on Dodd’s original claim. We dealt with
    this question in ‘<i>A Bullet for a Fig Leaf’</i>, Special Report No. 27.  </p>
  <p>Interestingly, the controversy evoked an array of writings
    locally, from lawyers and even the odd academic, free with their moral
    indignation against foreigners allegedly trying to exonerate the LTTE. The
    absence of hard evidence for their arguments was made up with semantics and
    insinuation. There was the danger that in the absence of any real investigation
    the case was going to be mired in verbal controversy, and the truth obscured.
    In the Addendum to this report we provide further strong evidence that backs up
    Dodd’s original identification of the 5.56 mm bullet.</p>
  <p>Indications we received from the beginning were that the
    SLMM’s identification of the security forces as the likely perpetrators was
    right, but their estimate of the time as early morning 4<sup>th</sup> August
    2006, which was also the time given officially by the Sri Lankan pathologist
    Dr. Waidyaratna, was wrong as we had testimony that the victims had been seen
    until the afternoon. The Sri Lankan pathologist contrary to what he put down in
    the inquest reports had, we later learnt, told Peter Apps of Reuters that the
    probable time of death was the 4<sup>th</sup> afternoon. This the JMO from
    Anuradhapura told Apps after examining some of the bodies at Trincomalee
    Hospital on 8<sup>th</sup> August 2006, well before preparing the post mortem
    reports. A list of our reports dealing with this case is given at the end.</p>
  <p>From what we earlier knew the killings could have taken
    place any time from 4<sup>th</sup> Friday afternoon to 5<sup>th</sup> Saturday
    morning when the deaths were reported. Very early, in September 2006, we
    obtained through one of our contacts the testimony of an elderly man from Mutur
    who lived close to the ACF office that an army patrol went into the ACF office
    at 4.15 PM. They left after a very short time. At 5 PM masked men in commando
    uniform came in a cavalcade of motorcycles. A senior officer followed in a
    vehicle with guards and they entered the ACF office. In about half an hour, he
    said, they went away. </p>
  <p>What confused us was that the source gave us the day as the
    5<sup>th</sup> of August, Saturday, when the town itself was fairly quiet. This
    source has subsequently been un-contactable. We should have paid more attention
    to this testimony, but were (Special Report No. 23 of November 2006) misled by
    strongly held opinion in Trincomalee that the killings took place on the 5<sup>th</sup> morning. It was later from other testimonies that we realised that people
    remembered events during the crisis as first day, second day etc and not by the
    date or day of the week.  </p>
  <p>We also mention another testimony we received in February
    2007 from a youth known to the ACF staff who was in Mutur two weeks after the
    incident. A Muslim elder met him in a shop and told him that the ACF was in
    Mutur helping the Muslims during the crisis by distributing potable water and
    relief during the siege and also helping with sanitation in camps. He added
    that some of ‘our boys’ had been involved in the killings. He said that he was
    on the road when he saw the security forces and some of the Muslim home guards
    coming from the ACF. Two home guards were mounted on an ACF motorcycle. One of
    them was Jehangir.</p>
  <p>This youth, although giving us genuine information, which
    matched the earlier testimony, made the kind of mistake we initially made. He
    had in mind what the SLMM concluded and said it happened on Friday morning. It
    was after several conversations with this youth that he remembered that the
    elder had also told him that he had seen this after he had attended prayers at
    the Mosque, and was subsequently convinced that it happened in the afternoon.
    His attempts at contacting the man again proved futile. </p>
  <p>These two testimonies focused our attention on the Naval
    Special Forces (which in the first testimony were mistaken for the more
    familiar STF because of the commando uniform) and Muslim home guards. </p>
  <p>Making the initial slip on the time was helpful in that once
    we realised it, we tried to reconstruct events more carefully with whatever new
    information we received. It was in respect of the Five Students and ACF cases
    that for the first time we were up against an outright cover up by the Sri
    Lankan authorities, their experts, Attorney General and diplomats overseas, and
    needed to be much more vigilant in pursuit of the truth. Fortunately, on the
    way we encountered more people who were equally keen and willing to do things
    that would have been pointless doing if no one was going to bring out the
    truth. It is to them we owe what we set out below.</p>

    and further Indications of the Time</span></span></a></h3>
  <p>A circumstance that led the SLMM to decide on the time of
    the incident as before 7.00 AM on 4<sup>th</sup> August 2006, was that ACF
    Mutur was un-contactable by radio or other means from that time. We received
    reports from Trincomalee that calls were received from Mutur ACF staff on the 4<sup>th</sup> evening and 5<sup>th</sup> early morning. But attempts to track them to the
    reported sources brought negative results. The course of the investigation also
    showed that the Government was very reluctant to release the phone call
    records.</p>
  <p>On the other hand, other testimonies of direct or indirect
    contact by Mutur residents earlier in the day appeared to stand. A religious
    leader in Mutur told us that he had been to the ACF around 8.00 to 8.30 AM in
    the morning and advised the staff to join them as they were leaving Mutur on foot.
    The ACF staff refused saying that their superiors had told them to remain in
    the office to be picked up.</p>
  <p>A member of the ACF staff who was not staying at the office
    and left Mutur on foot with most of the residents, was positive that the staff
    members were alive when they left about 10.00 AM on the 4<sup>th</sup>. He had
    not met them but a lady who cooked had met them after 9.00 AM. This was further
    supported by a report in the <i>Sunday </i><i>Virakesari, </i>a Tamil language Sunday newspaper of 13<sup>th</sup> August 2006: “<i>Finally, the sister next door who fed them
    also met them and said, “Everyone is packing up and going and you are staying.
    There will be no point in worrying after something happens</i>.” </p>
  <p>The decision by Tamils to pack up and go seems to have been
    taken on the 4<sup>th</sup> morning and not before. A refugee at the Methodist
    Church told us that the LTTE came that morning and told them that they are
    going to fire mortars at the Jetty naval garrison, and if they are staying they
    must dig bunkers or they must go. Some started digging bunkers and found the
    ground too hard and decided that they must all leave. It was then that people
    began scurrying to make some last minute arrangements. </p>
  <p>When we contacted the lady interviewed by <i>Virakesari</i>,
    she was scared to talk. Muslim friends also told us that Muslims who were
    leaving had after mosque prayers asked the Muslim ACF employee Jaufer to join
    them and leave on foot, but he wanted to stay with the others. This may be any
    time after 11.00 AM, as prayers usually conducted at Friday 1.30 PM may have
    been held earlier.</p>
  <p>About mid-2007, a senior Sister at the Mutur Convent told us
    that sometime after their exodus from Mutur, she met some Muslims in
    Trincomalee, who told her that after the LTTE had left, some at the ACF had
    walked down to a grocery store on the Main Rd. close to the Hospital to buy tea
    and some eatables. This seemed afternoon on the 4<sup>th </sup>since the
    general consensus was that the LTTE vacated the town around noon on that day.
    Another source told us that two boys from a Tamil family that was staying with
    Muslims had met Narmathan and some others from the ACF at a shop close to the
    Hospital late afternoon on the 4<sup>th</sup>. In neither of these were we able
    to trace the sources.</p>
  <p>A concerned Muslim lady gave us information that supported
    the general drift. Abdul Hakim, a Muslim militant leader in Mutur, was shot
    dead by the LTTE on 30<sup>th</sup> September 2005. After that the militants
    divided. One group remained armed. The other felt that Jihad is a deeper
    ethically demanding concept that is much more than carrying arms and became a
    non-violent religious group. The second group became law abiding citizens and
    started exposing crimes of the militant section. (See Appendix I)</p>
  <p>A member of the second group told this lady that the
    killings had taken place around 5.30 on Friday 4<sup>th</sup> evening and some
    of the Muslim militants had been involved. The informant promised more, but was
    thereafter unreachable. The lady gathered that people in Mutur were being
    intimidated to be silent on this. </p>
  <p>While sharing an end of the day stimulant, a Muslim man in
    Mutur told a friend recently that the ACF killings took place on the afternoon
    of Friday 4<sup>th</sup> August. He identified Home Guard Farook (No.68069) as
    one of those involved. Farook was notorious in that before August 2006 the security
    forces allegedly used him to abduct, torture and kill Tamils coming from the
    LTTE-controlled area. We also received testimony that he went out with the
    Special Forces on the 3<sup>rd</sup> August evening. But we have so far not
    received information on what he was doing on the 4<sup>th</sup>. Unlike
    Jehangir who was garrulous, Farook was quiet.</p>
  <p>Another incident
    that was not taken seriously at that time is significant in retrospect. On
    Friday 4<sup>th</sup> afternoon an ACF group went with expatriate officer Elias
    to collect their colleagues in Mutur. They returned to the ACF office about
    7.00 PM. One of those who came back was informed by a friend that the Programme
    Manager Alabdeen had got a call and he then told Frank Kano that about 15
    bodies had been found in a house in Mutur. The others did not take it seriously
    as rumours were coming in that the ACF staff had left and were seen in various
    places. It now appears that one of the neighbours of the Mutur ACF had seen the
    bodies and phoned Alabdeen whom he knew. Alabdeen very likely felt bad and gave
    a euphemistic version. Our source thinks the call came about 6.00 – 6.30 PM.  </p>
  <p>Inconclusive as things were, it appeared almost certain that
    the killings took place in the afternoon or evening of 4<sup>th</sup> August.
    At least whatever the cause of the breakdown of radio communication, it seemed
    to have to do with mundane causes, such as an inability to run or restart the
    generator that powered the communications rather than deliberate damage. It is
    conceivable that the LTTE did visit the ACF office on Friday morning, as they
    did the Methodist Church, and again advised them to leave. If the ACF staff had
    told them that their orders were to stay, the LTTE may have got angry and done
    something to the radio. But there is nothing to support this except a report
    from some of the ACF staff of a cable linking the radio to the antenna being
    pulled out. It falls to the courts to ask the ACF for the radio and clear the
    matter. The inability to find confirmed instances of calls using cell phones
    was problematic but not crucial. If they were unable to run up their generator
    and charge the batteries, their cell phones too may have run out of charge.</p>
  <p>But one factor is worth mentioning. The Police very early
    obtained all the cell phone numbers of the victims and details of calls made
    from the cell phone companies. But to date this evidence has not been made
    public. Is it because calls were made during the course of the day that
    conflict with the Government’s version that the victims were killed early in
    the morning?</p>

  <p>When the LTTE came into Mutur on the night of 2<sup>nd</sup> August 2004, the Police left their positions in town and regrouped at Mutur
    police station. Government artillery shells were falling wildly. Magistrate
    Ganesharajah and the Magistrate’s police security, which included Sergeants
    Mahendran and Padmananda, went to the Police Station. The Police warded off the
    Tigers with small arms and mortars.</p>
  <p>One witness (hereafter referred to as W) who remained in the
    Sinnamattakalappu area near the courts saw in the morning of 2<sup>nd</sup> August about 40 bloodied sarongs. Many
    sarongs had on them weapons and ammunition. The LTTE cadres who came were all
    in sarongs, not in uniform. This witness saw a group of LTTE cadres having a
    meal and is certain from their accent that they were neither from Batticaloa,
    Mutur nor Jaffna, but seemed to speak with a Hill Country accent.</p>
  <p>The Police Station
    was under siege. On the 2<sup>nd</sup> little before noon around half a dozen
    policemen and home guards went to the Jetty to obtain ammunition and some
    weapons from the Navy who managed to hold on. The Police were quite well
    stocked with weapons but lacked ammunition. While these were being brought back
    in a tractor, an LTTE shell from the direction of Pachchanoor landed close to
    it, killing, according to a member of the party, a police sergeant and a home
    guard. The rest abandoned the cargo. Most of the survivors returned to the
    station. One who went missing returned to Mutur some days later. Nilantha who
    worked at the armoury was slightly injured, but was able to function and got
    back to the station.   </p>
  <p>At the Police
    Station itself the men fought valiantly even though the officer in charge was
    only the Acting OIC, Inspector D.M. Abeywardene. Mutur was one of those
    stations where the superiors usually kept away in Trincomalee. The policemen
    felt the absence of more senior officers who could lead and told the IGP when
    he talked to them. The night of 2<sup>nd</sup> August was critical with the
    Police running low on ammunition. About mid night an LTTE shell exploded
    killing a policeman. Meanwhile Judge Anton Balasingham of the Trincomalee High
    Court was trying his best to get the Mutur Magistrate out. But the Police in
    Trincomalee wanted him kept there. It looked to sources close to Judge
    Balasingham that the Police wanted to keep the Magistrate as a shield.  </p>
  <p>Around 11.30 AM on
    Thursday 3<sup>rd</sup>, the Police were contemplating abandoning the station
    and moving to the Jetty where the Navy was. Their superiors at Trincomalee
    persuaded them to stay until relief arrived. Naval Special Forces Commandos
    were landed at the Jetty and they came along the coast reaching the Police
    Station about 1.30 PM the same day, bringing enough ammunition and arms.</p>
  <p>A point of
    importance is that ASP Sarath Mulleriyawa and OIC Chandana Senanayake of the
    Mutur Police arrived at their station with the commandos. Thereafter the ASP,
    OIC and the officer in charge of the commando unit, referred to by others
    present as a major, stayed together at the Police Station.</p>
  <p>That afternoon
    things looked quieter and about 4.30 PM some commandos with home guards who
    knew the area went towards the Hospital. Although the hospital had suffered
    shell damage, some displaced persons were there. Those who went checked them
    and were coming away when an LTTE man who had disguised himself as a Muslim in
    a prayer cap fired and killed one commando and injured two others. The dead man
    and the injured were carried to a point on the beach close to the Police
    Station where a naval vessel docked, quickly loaded and took off. The incident
    at the Hospital deterred the commandos from venturing into the south and east
    of the town the same day (3<sup>rd</sup>). They returned to the Police Station.</p>
  <p>On Thursday night
    the news quoted the Army Commander that Mutur is 80% captured and the LTTE were
    trapped and cannot escape. The security forces radio at the police station
    announced at 6.30 AM on Friday 4<sup>th</sup> morning that they had captured
    Mutur town and several LTTE bodies were strewn around including 50 to 60 bodies
    close to the Jetty.</p>
  <p>With regard to the
    ACF killings these claims caused controversy. The <i>Daily News</i> of 4<sup>th</sup> morning quoted cabinet spokesman Keheliya Rambukwelle claiming (on the 3<sup>rd</sup> night) that ‘<i>Muttur town is under the total control of the Security
    Forces</i>’. But the same spokesman
    after the SLMM statement pointed to the security forces as the party most
    likely behind the ACF killings, maintained that the crime, committed around the
    4<sup>th</sup> morning according to post mortem reports, was the work of the
    LTTE.</p>
  <p>Another event on
    Thursday 3<sup>rd</sup> is of considerable, but also misleading, significance.
    Jehangir was as mentioned, one of the home guards at the Police Station. Being
    natives of the place, several of them were moving in and out of the Police
    Station and bringing intelligence. Jehangir had a brother named Zahir Khan who
    was in the armed Muslim group. According to a story reaching the Police at that
    time, a Tamil boy who described himself a member of the Karuna group got
    friendly with him. Zahir believed him and told him the truth about himself. The
    boy being really an LTTE cadre pulled out a weapon and shot Zahir dead.
    Jehangir who heard about this the same day, was seen very angry, swearing
    revenge. </p>

    Evidence at Last</span></span></span></a></h1>
  <p>On Friday morning
    the Special Forces went on patrol with some of the home guards. Jehangir was
    keen to show them the places where the LTTE supposedly were. About 8.30 AM, the
    officer commanding the Special Forces at the Police Station gave orders to his
    men on patrol, “<i>Demala kathakaranna kattiya civil ekeng hitiyanang</i>…”
    (whose purport was, “If you encounter any Tamil speakers (i.e. Muslims or
    Tamils) in civilian dress, finish them off [if you have any suspicions]”). This
    order appeared to reflect the shooting dead of a commando by an LTTE cadre
    wearing a Muslim prayer cap the previous day. The significance of the order for
    the ACF killings lies in that it made arbitrary killing of civilians
    permissible.</p>
  <p>We mentioned that
    Jehangir was angry about the LTTE’s killing of Zahir Khan and he was regularly
    getting information from Muslims who were moving about quite freely on Friday.
    The fact that most civilians had left Mutur on foot by 10.00 AM and the ACF
    people were still there was bound to attract attention.</p>
  <p>Going back to our
    witness W,<span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'> </span>having been cut off from developments to the
    east of his area, he went out of his home in Sinnamattakalappu and by then the
    area was deserted. He then walked in the direction of the Roman Catholic and
    Methodist churches, to see if he could find his wife and children whom he had
    sent to the Methodist Church, but by then all had left. (They had gone to
    Kantalai with the Tamils and later phoned him from there.) On the way he met
    two Muslims on bicycles, who told him that the Army had come into town. He then
    came across a tea boutique that was open, and the few people who were there
    offered him food. He had not eaten for some days, and said that he preferred
    only&nbsp;a cup of tea for a start. He got back around

</script>
    1.30 PM and it was then that he saw the Army (Special Forces) near the
    DS’s office west of the Hospital in the direction of the Police Station further
    west.</p>
  <p>The Special Forces,
    home guards and possibly policemen who accompanied them returned to the Police
    Station at about 4.00 PM and after a short time went out again and came back by
    5.00 PM. Among those who accompanied the Special Forces were the home guards
    Jehangir, Ramzan, Fahid Rilvan, Sultan Faseeth and Ganguly (nickname). </p>
  <p>A witness who saw
    them on their return opines that it was on this last trip that the ACF killings
    took place. His reasoning was that Rilvan had told him that he came back on a
    motorcycle, although this motorcycle was not brought into the Police Station.
    Rilvan had not talked about the killings. This also matched one of the earliest
    testimonies we received, that after the incident Jehangir and another were seen
    leaving the ACF on one motorcycle – one of the two stolen from the ACF, the
    second presumably later (see Appendix I). The time also fell into place and
    matched the pathologist’s honest opinion given to Peter Apps – Friday late
    afternoon.</p>
  <p>This also made it
    certain that the Police and Home Guards knew much more about the killings and
    that was the place to make further inquiries. Indeed, Jehangir was not the type
    to remain silent as we learnt.</p>

    The Truth Finally</span></span></span></span></a></h1>
  <p>Early attempts to
    get information from sources close to the Police and Home Guards were
    fruitless. What was clear was that they knew, but were very scared to talk. And
    so, it was maintained, their superior SSP (Operations) Kapila Jayasekere knew
    about the killings only when apparently an anonymous caller told Prem working
    at the Trincomalee ACF office on the 6<sup>th</sup> and he told the Police
    resulting in Jayasekere ordering SI Gunawardene to investigate. Contrary to
    what the Police maintain, a local councillor Ragees from Mutur had informed ACF
    Trincomalee on the 5<sup>th</sup> morning and also told the BBC the same day. </p>
  <p>After a search by
    friends, we came across a number of sources with a good knowledge of goings on
    at the Police Station. Several sources are involved and we will merely describe
    what happened. A number of persons would speak out if they would not suffer
    adverse measures from the protectors of the law. </p>
  <p>Having gone through
    over a year of deception by the Police and Attorney General’s Department, a
    simple policeman with a sense of shame who was then in Mutur confessed, “<i>Ape
    kattiya thamai marala dhamma. Kaatath kiyanda bahe. Api boruwata thamai satchi
    dhunna</i>.” Rendering the Sinhalese idiomatically into Sri Lankan English, it
    reads, “<i>Our chaps only killed and dumped them. It is a shame we can’t tell
    anyone. For lies only we gave evidence</i>.” Indeed, just before the policemen
    went before the Commission of Inquiry, a senior officer told them to maintain
    that they were stuck in the Police Station and did not know what went on
    outside.  </p>
  <p>About 3.00 PM on 4<sup>th</sup> August it got around the police station that a message had come from a senior
    officer of the Trincomalee Police that the ACF staff was stranded, to take care
    of them and send them to Trincomalee safe and sound. Our sources said that the
    police officers in charge did not act as though this was their intention. </p>
  <p>After the Naval
    Special Forces patrol came back to the Police Station around 4.00 PM there was
    a sense of relief. They were sure that the LTTE had left Mutur town. Jehangir,
    who had come to know that the ACF staff had stayed back had been insistent
    about the ACF being an LTTE base. We believe that anything that Jehangir said
    in anger was a pretext for others high up who wanted to harm the ACF staff, as
    all responsible persons knew that it was civilians who were at the ACF office.
    Jehangir as a home guard had no rank and was lower than a constable. Such
    persons are at best servitors and scavengers used in dirty work (See Appendix
    I). In Mutur, Jehangir had been guiding the commandos and had in the meantime
    become very chummy with them.</p>
  <p>The ASP and OIC
    asked Jehangir, the OIC’s bodyguard Susantha, and another favourite Nilantha,
    who received a minor injury on the 2<sup>nd</sup> from LTTE fire in an incident
    described above, to go with the Special Forces to see if there were any LTTE
    cadres at the ACF. A party of about two-dozen went including a dozen commandos
    (Naval Special Forces) and the rest home guards and policemen. On the way
    Jehangir spoke to men who came on a bicycle who confirmed that the ACF staff
    was there.</p>
  <p>Led by the
    commandos, Jehangir and the rest of the party including policemen and home
    guards turned left from the main road past the Hospital, and went to the ACF.
    The commandos surrounded the place. Those at the ACF were drinking tea and
    eating biscuits, stuff they had bought a little while ago.</p>
  <p>The commandos called
    the ACF staff and asked them in Sinhalese what they were doing there after
    everyone else had left. The latter replied that their Trinco office had asked
    them to remain. Jehangir butted into the conversation and without giving the
    ACF staff a chance to explain, insisted that the staff were LTTE. Susantha and
    Nilantha, the two policemen with him said nothing. The commandos remained
    passive. Jehangir got the staff to kneel, and the victims were fired upon as
    they begged for mercy. It was all over within five minutes from the time they
    arrived. Two were killed away from the others, apparently trying to run away
    and their bodies were found separately.</p>
  <p>The main persons who
    fired at the ACF staff were Home Guard Jehangir, Police Constable Susantha and
    Police Constable Nilantha. The party got back to the Police Station by 5.00 PM.
    The word of a mere home guard and servitor of dubious reputation sufficed
    apparently for the commandos and policemen to commit the atrocity.</p>
  <p>Upon their return,
    there was an air of celebration. Jehangir, Susantha and Nilatha were given a
    heroes’ welcome by ASP Sarath Mulleriyawa and OIC Chandana Senanayake, who
    warmly shook hands with them.</p>
  <p>This was very
    strange. The fact of the ACF staff being stuck in Mutur was much talked about
    in INGO circles. There had been a meeting of INGOs and NGOs at 11.00 AM the
    same day at the Trincomalee UN office where the matter was taken up. Most
    importantly, the ASP and OIC in Mutur had been asked to ensure that the ACF
    were safely conveyed to Trincomalee.  </p>
  <p>How does one explain the celebration of murder at the Mutur
    police station? The way it happened and the far reaching cover up, all go to
    suggest that it was not the ASP and OIC who took the decision to kill. Despite
    their receiving instructions from a senior officer to safeguard the ACF staff,
    someone else more powerful, it seems, gave instructions to use some pretext to
    kill them. Jehangir and perhaps some other hotheads who wanted revenge may have
    provided such a pretext. The commandos must have been instructed by their
    commanding officer to let it happen. We explain later why someone more senior
    in Trincomalee may have welcomed the pretext provided by Jehangir for the
    executions.</p>

    Report</span></span></span></a></h1>
  <p>We argued in Special Report No.27 ‘<i>A Bullet for a Fig
    Leaf’</i> that Dodd’s reasons for going back on his initial identification of a
    5.56 mm projectile found in Romila’s body were entirely unacceptable. He
    changed his mind after the Sri Lankan Government Analyst sent him a purported
    photograph of the projectile that was not the original – the original we must
    assume has been destroyed. An elementary difference between a discharged 5.56
    mm projectile and the core of a 7.62 mm projectile, which the Government
    Analyst claimed the object was, is that the former has lands and grooves
    visible to the naked eye, while a core has a smooth surface.</p>
  <p>Further, Dodd said he had relied on three CID men present at
    the second autopsy to make the identification. Sub Inspector Sanjaya Perera had
    earlier submitted to court among productions from the scene objects that were
    cores of bullets with their distinctive grey blackish colouring as opposed to
    the copper colouring of a bullet. Neither he nor the expert, Dr. Dodd, could
    have mistaken a core for a discharged projectile.</p>
  <p>Our sources said that while the Police were generally issued
    with T-56 weapons, which fired 7.62 mm bullets, Susantha’s personal weapon was
    black in colour, the barrel about the size of one’s forearm and fired bullets
    about the size of revolver bullets, thick and squat, like 9 mm bullets. From
    this and further information in the Addendum, we conclude that Susantha’s was
    an 18.5 inches long Uzi submachine gun. Nilantha had an LMG (Light Machine
    Gun), which fired bullets fed by an ammunition belt. (The bullet types are 9 x
    19 mm for the Uzi, 7.62 x 39 mm for T-56 and 5.56 x 45 mm for M-16.) Susantha
    was a technical buff who did handiwork such as electrical wiring around the
    station and was a particular favourite of OIC Senanayake whose bodyguard he
    was. Uzi is a bodyguard’s weapon.</p>
  <p>We further found that Susantha PC 59495 knew different kinds
    of weapons and had with two sergeants manned the 80 mm and 60 mm mortars during
    the defence of the Police Station. PC Nilantha, the other policeman involved in
    the killings was also close to the OIC. He assisted the sergeant in charge of the
    station’s armoury. Their closeness to the OIC is a point of immense
    significance. They were trusted henchmen.</p>
  <p>Susantha and Nilantha killed about six of the ACF victims,
    while Jehangir killed most of those remaining. Jehangir was also an expert in
    different weapons and taught policemen their use. A minimum of four types of
    ammunition were used at the scene. There is no reason for us to trust the
    Police’s collection of productions. The earliest testimony we quoted above said
    that the killers soon departed and about half an hour later another group came
    in a cavalcade in commando type uniform. This suggests that someone higher up
    was alarmed by the ACF killings, and the group came to pick up traces of
    incriminating ammunition. The commando officer appears to have wanted to make
    sure that no 5.56 mm or other novel types of ammunition were left lying around
    – an indication that such bullets, distinct from the common 7.62 x 39 mm, were
    fired. We confirm this in the Addendum. The naval commandos were seen having M
    16 and FN Minimi guns, both of which fired 5.56 x 45 mm ammunition.</p>
  <p>What the foregoing tells us is that the whole question of
    weapons use in the incident had been distorted by the investigation and does
    not deserve any credit for professionalism. This also shows that Dr. Dodd,
    unethically, took what seemed the easy way out by going back on his earlier
    positive identification of a 5.56 mm projectile, rather than prolong a
    controversy over a bullet he did not have in hand. He would have done better if
    he had simply demanded that the Government Analyst give him the original
    photographs taken and certified at the autopsy. </p>
  <p>M-16 and FN Minimi (M 249) weapons, both of which fired both
    M193 and SS109 type 5.56 x 45 mm bullets, were definitely available at scene of
    crime. Whether one was used, or not, the commando unit shares the culpability
    for murder. If one was not used there was really no reason for the Government
    to get so thoroughly worked up about Dodd’s initial identification of a 5.56 mm
    bullet in Romila’s head.  </p>
  <p>While we postpone further discussion of the question of the
    bullet in Romila to the Addendum, we mention here that although initially
    reluctant one of our sources said that Jehangir killed the four women who were
    in a group. At some point Jehangir changed guns with one of the commandos he
    was chummy with. With the additional evidence in the Addendum, we may put an
    end to the controversy. Romila was on available evidence killed by a 5.56 mm
    bullet.</p>

    ACF Killings?</span></span></span></a></h1>
  <p><u>The following points are striking:</u></p>
  <p style='&quot;%1\:1\:0\:\.&quot; Vikadakavi 20080327T1954;
'>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Most Mutur civilians had left for Killiveddy and Kantalai on
    foot by 10.00 AM. By 3.00 PM the ASP and OIC had been told authoritatively the
    plight of the ACF staff and asked to look into their safety. Meanwhile Jehangir
    badly wanted revenge for his brother and was campaigning that those at the ACF
    are Tigers. But the general sense was that the Tigers had all left. That is
    what reports from the security forces were saying, the Special Forces upon
    return from patrol had not reported a Tiger presence in town and the Police had
    their own intelligence. Looking for Tigers at the ACF office at this point
    sounds bizarre.</p>
  <p style='&quot;%1\:2\:0\:\.&quot; Vikadakavi 20080327T1954;
'>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Susantha and Nilantha who participated in the killing were
    very close to the OIC and the question arises if they had been instructed to
    kill. The ASP and OIC had completely disregarded advice from Trincomalee about
    the ACF staff around 2.30 to 3.00 PM and sent this patrol with the commandos
    around 4.00 PM ostensibly to see if there really were Tigers at the ACF. </p>
  <p style='&quot;%1\:3\:0\:\.&quot; Vikadakavi 20080327T1954;
'>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The commandos were indifferent to the fate of the ACF staff,
    made no attempt to check if they were LTTE and completely disregarded their
    obvious civilian character. Jehangir, Nilantha and Susantha simply proceeded to
    shoot the staff based on Jehangir’s absurd claim that they were Tigers, and
    Jehangir who had no rank is lower than a constable.</p>
  <p style='&quot;%1\:4\:0\:\.&quot; Vikadakavi 20080327T1954;
'>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This strongly suggests that the ASP and OIC had in fact
    strongly hinted to the three that the ACF staff must be killed. They are very
    unlikely to have taken such a reckless approach unless some powerful superior
    in Trincomalee had given an instruction to kill rather than protect. The ASP
    and OIC who were with the commando officer at the Police HQ in Mutur must have
    obtained his compliance.</p>
  <p>We now come to the police set up. The chief police officer
    in Trincomalee was DIG Rohan Abeywardene. Under him were three SSPs. The two
    original SSPs were SSP Trincomalee, Nihal Samarakoon, and SSP Kantalai. The
    third SSP was Kapila Jayasekere, earlier SP Operations and was in July, just
    before the ACF killings, promoted to SSP Operations. Mutur police station came
    under SSP Trincomalee who is answerable for what happened there even if he was
    overridden by the DIG.</p>
  <p>Police reports on investigations make no reference to SSP Nihal
    Samarakoon and the ACF case was from the beginning handled by Kapila Jayasekere
    and subsequently by the same pair Kapila Jayasekere and Zawahir, OIC Crimes,
    Harbour Police, who handled the investigation of the 5 Students’ case – we have
    pointed out in Special Report No.24 that these two played a leading role in the
    latter crime and the cover up. Was there a connection between the ACF killings
    and the Five Students’ case?</p>

    and Five Students’ cases</span></span></span></a></h1>
  <p>We have noted in our reports the systematic intimidation of
    witnesses and families in the Five Students’ case. Because of this a great deal
    of information was lost as witnesses and families were forced to flee and, as
    we mentioned before, an important witness, Balachandran, was killed. Among the
    witnesses forced to flee were the family of Yogarajah, which directly links the
    two cases. Of Yogarajah’s three sons, the youngest, Hemachandran was one of the
    five students killed on 2<sup>nd</sup> January 2006 and his eldest Kodeeswaran
    was one of the ACF employees killed.</p>
  <p>Kodeeswaran’s house is about 60 yards from the beach. When
    the bomb blast was heard at about 7.35 PM on 2<sup>nd</sup> January 2006, his
    mother became anxious and told the others that Hemachandran had gone that side.
    Yogarajah went towards the beach. He got to the junction in front of the Urban
    Council. He was caught by men in military uniform (whom he takes to be the STF
    or Police and we know to be STF), gave him a blow on the back and ordered him
    down. He lay flat, back up, with another 25 or so persons, including women. An
    STF man who looked crazed pointed a gun, threatening the people, “<i>They are
    all Tigers, all must be shot.</i>” Some women who were detained screamed. The
    Navy was nearby, but did not interfere. Soon afterwards, the powerful light
    that was on the side of the road was switched off, Yogarajah thinks by the STF.
    Few minutes later, he heard boys shouting, “<i>Aiyo Amma</i>” (Help, Mother).
    Then he heard gunshots. Ten minutes later the same persons ordered them to get
    up and go back the way they came.</p>
  <p>While the father was at the scene, Kodeeswaran was
    desperately trying to get through to the cell phone of Hemachandran’s friend
    Rohan. Twice there was no answer. The third time someone answered and spoke to
    the caller for three minutes until 7.52 PM. The firing took place shortly
    afterwards.</p>
  <p>The middle brother Baskaran said that Kodeeswaran never
    fully disclosed the import of the conversation, but from hints dropped, he
    believes the speaker at the other end was VAS Perera, the head of the STF team,
    and he had got Kodeeswaran’s address and personal details.</p>
  <p>Before inquest proceedings began in the Trincomalee District
    Court on 10<sup>th</sup> January, two men came home in civils about midday and
    threatened the family not to testify. The next day some persons came home and
    shouted ‘<i>Ado</i>’ (a rude threatening way of addressing people in
    Sinhalese).  </p>
  <p>Ten or twelve days after the beach incident, auto rickshaw
    driver Balachandran came home around 10.00AM and spoke to them from the gate.
    Balachandran knew the Yogarajahs from their former residence at Railway
    Approach Avenue near where he lived (Madaththady). He said that Driver
    Hemachandran (alias Aathavan) drove the green auto rickshaw from which the bomb
    was first thrown at the students (Special Report No.24). Further inquiries by
    victim families brought the information that the two persons seated at the back
    of the auto rickshaw who threw the bomb at the students were a son of Weerakody
    and a Sinhalese vegetable seller whose son with an unruly record was killed a
    little earlier, probably by the LTTE. Weerakody Senior had been killed by the
    LTTE nine days before the students were killed.  </p>
  <p>Yogarajah reflected that the auto rickshaw driver
    Hemachandran knew his son of the same name as they all lived in the same
    neighbourhood earlier and the former used to come occasionally seeking his son.
    Yogarajah knew that Driver Hemachandran was a thug and enjoyed close ties with
    and protection from the Police. He warned his son not to consort with him as
    that might have repercussions from the LTTE.  </p>
  <p>Balachandran left after telling the Yogarajahs not to tell
    anyone about this, as it would place him in danger. He was reluctant to come
    there afterwards. Baskaran thinks what Balachandran told them was heard by the
    policemen at the checkpoint for the Prison and Old Police Station barely a few
    feet away. The policemen were usually behind cover. Balachandran was abducted
    from his home on 24<sup>th</sup> August 2006 and killed. Weerakody’s son in the
    Navy, Udawatte, reportedly supervised the killing.</p>
  <p>The families on 2<sup>nd</sup> February 2006 observed the 31<sup>st</sup> day at the same beach where the incident took place. At that time SP Kapila
    Jayasekere passed them while driving from the direction of the courts towards
    Fort Frederick. A little later six or seven policemen, two of them in civils,
    came from the direction where Kapila Jayasekere went. They approached
    Kodeeswaran and asked threateningly, “<i>What are you doing</i>?” Kodeeswaran
    was the sort who gets quickly worked up and talks back strongly. A Tamil police
    sergeant who knew him observed, “<i>He was the sort who reacts quickly, but is
    scared within</i>.”</p>
  <p>Just about that time a letter came home warning the
    Yogarajahs that they must all leave the country or everyone of them would be
    shot dead.  </p>
  <p>Kodeeswaran was going about on the motorcycle that
    Hemachandran used to ride. One day the Police stopped him late evening on Green
    Rd. while he was returning home. An officer, whom Baskaran thinks may have been
    Kapila Jayasekere, looked at the number and asked Kodeeswaran, “<i>Are you
    keeping well</i>?” Baskaran said that even stopping someone on Green Rd. was
    unusual</p>
  <p>On another occasion Kodeeswaran was returning home from the
    ACF office pushing his motorbike with a deflated tyre towards the petrol shed
    in front of the Buddhist temple to inflate it, when an army vehicle stopped in
    front of the temple. Seven or eight soldiers came towards him and questioned
    him for a long time holding him up. Kodeeswaran later told his father that he
    realised that they held him up to abduct him, but he somehow made his escape.</p>
  <p>After the killing of the five students, Trincomalee folk who
    often find out what is going on within the security forces, formed a strong
    conclusion that Inspector Zawahir, Deputy OIC of the Harbour Police had
    connived with Kapila Jayasekere to stage the Five Students’ tragedy. It
    happened on a day when the OIC for that area was on leave and Zawahir was
    acting. </p>
  <p>Baskaran reflected that Kodeeswaran used to get very angry
    when he saw Inspector Zawahir passing in his vehicle. He used to remark, “<i>I
    feel like throwing a bomb at him</i>.” Also remarkably, after the ACF incident
    where Kodeeswaran was killed, one policeman was placed on duty opposite their
    house to check visitors. All these factors indicate that Yogarajah’s family was
    being closely watched. It is not just the original killing of the five
    students, but also the killing later in January of reporter S.S. Rajan who
    provided media publicity for the killings and funerals, the continuous
    intimidation of those who might move the case forward and the killing of
    Balachandran, are all manifestations of the ruthlessness with which the Police
    in particular was determined to suppress the evidence.</p>
  <p>In the light of this the Police and especially SP Kapila
    Jayasekere and his superior DIG Abeywardene would have felt nervous about
    Kodeeswaran. Having gone to the lengths they did in crime, their careers were
    threatened by exposure in court. Kodeeswaran’s ACF colleagues knew he was under
    threat. One told us that he avoided going out of Trincomalee town, and should
    never have been sent to Mutur under these uncertain conditions.</p>
  <p>When persons wanting to harm Kodeeswaran found that he
    remained exposed in Mutur due to bad instructions from the ACF, and there was
    on the other hand Jehangir crazy about revenge campaigning that the ACF office
    was a Tiger stronghold, what happened is not surprising. The planned massacre
    of the five innocent students was an eloquent statement of government thinking
    on active young Tamils. The stranded youths at the ACF were an opportunity not
    to be lost. The Yogarajahs were aware of the danger and blame the ACF for not
    listening to other NGOs and to the parents and allowing this to happen.</p>
  <p>One could not have expected anything from the police
    investigation under SSP Kapila Jayasekere other than to suppress evidence of
    the State’s culpability. Inspector Zawahir who was unfavourably identified with
    Kapila Jayasekere in the Five Students’ case visited an elder whom we believe
    was one whose testimony we cited above. According to Zawahir he left home on 3<sup>rd</sup> August because of LTTE terror and got back just the day, 9<sup>th</sup>, when
    Zawahir interviewed him. This elder Haji Abdul Rahuman has been missing from
    late September 2006. </p>
  <p>Zawahir’s bullying of witnesses was also in evidence in the
    Five Students’ case. The Police first wanted the parents to certify that their
    sons were LTTE cadres before releasing the bodies. He told Dr. Manoharan, the
    parent of Ragihar, one of the Five Students, at Trincomalee Hospital at 7.00 AM
    on the morning after the killings, “<i>My son learnt table tennis from your
    son. I will release your son’s body, but why do you want to interest yourself
    in the others</i>?” A number of features of the ACF case places it a potential
    fiasco like the Bindunuwewa case.  </p>

  <p><span lang=EN-GB>Inmates of
    the Bindunuwewa Rehabilitation Centre, all young Tamils, were attacked on the
    morning of 25<sup>th</sup> October 2000 by a mob of an estimated 2000
    comprising villagers and outside elements ferried in, while the Police stood
    by, abetted and participated in the outrage. 27 youths from the Centre were
    killed and 14 injured. The youths were either LTTE surrendees or persons picked
    up on suspicion, none of whom had been charged with any offence. </span></p>
  <p><span lang=EN-GB>The </span>Trial-at-Bar
    comprising High Court Judges, Sarath Ambepitya, Eric Basanayake and Upali
    Abeyaratne delivered death sentences on five of the accused in July 2003. Two
    of the defendants were police Inspector Senaka Jayampathy Karunasena and
    Sub-Inspector Tyronne Roger Ratnayake. By 27<sup>th</sup> May 2005<span
class=textbold> the five-member bench of the Supreme Court comprising Justices
    T.B. Weerasuriya, Nihal Jayasinghe, N.K. Udalagama, N.E. Dissanayake and Raja
    Fernando had acquitted all five on appeal.</span> The bench led by T.B.
    Weerasuriya ruled that the Attorney General failed to prove the charges without
    reasonable doubt. <span lang=EN-GB>We discussed
    this in Special Report No.19 Part I of 12<sup>th</sup> June 2005.</span></p>
  <p><span lang=EN-GB>For many
    observers justice was parodied even at the High Court level by prosecuting
    relatively junior officers acting under orders from their superiors, when in
    fact these superiors – ASP Dayaratne and HQI Jayampathy Seneviratne – were also
    present at the scene of crime. B.M. Premaratne, SSP of the region too is
    answerable under command responsibility. Especially also because he gave the
    media a biased and twisted account that the Tamil youths had broken into the
    store of the Centre, armed themselves with implements for attack and provoked
    the villagers by displaying their genitals and throwing stones.</span></p>
  <p><span lang=EN-GB>In our
    report we furnished strong reasons why Uva Province Chief Minister not only
    knew about the massacre beforehand but also was among the instigators.</span></p>
  <p><span lang=EN-GB>Against
    this build up involving the high and mighty, legal proceedings trying to pin
    the blame on an Inspector and Sub Inspector made a mockery of justice. The
    Supreme Court thankfully put the finishing touches and brought the farce to a
    close.</span></p>
  <p><span lang=EN-GB>The answer
    to the question why Sri Lanka is steeped in recurrent gross crimes, especially
    against the minorities, that go unchecked is not far to seek. The rulers
    without good sense or vision would fight hard against command responsibility
    being invoked in judicial practice. This would have been relatively harmless if
    the politicians and security forces were reasonably law abiding. Unfortunately,
    this country is determined to earn the contempt and ridicule of the rest of the
    world.</span></p>
  <p><span lang=EN-GB>Where the
    ACF and Five Students’ cases resemble the Bindunuwewa case lies in that all
    occasioned intense lobbying, propaganda and perversions of the legal process
    aimed at obscuring the truth. If more evidence turns up against obstruction by
    the State, we could see who would be sacrificed if, as is now the norm in Sri
    Lanka, the prosecution works towards criminal responsibility. It may just be
    VAS Perera and one or two of his men in the Five Students’ case. </span></p>
  <p><span lang=EN-GB>In the ACF
    case, it would be confined to PCs Susantha and Nilantha and Home Guard
    Jehangir. The ASP and OIC would maintain that they only asked these
    subordinates to go and see if there were Tigers at the ACF. They would deny
    instigation to kill. There is no police force here with the independence and
    integrity to question all who were there individually and build up a case
    against senior officers. </span></p>

  <p><span lang=EN-GB>Command
    responsibility is no secret in the Five Students’ case. The Human Rights
    Commission’s Special Rapporteur and many locals, besides us, have identified SP
    (now SSP) Kapila Jayasekere as the executor of the plot. Defence Advisor
    H.M.G.B. Kotakadeniya sent the STF team with, according to him, the Defence
    Secretary’s consent. Insufficient attention has been paid to DIG Rohan
    Abeywardene under whom Kapila Jayasekere was acting. We have since learnt that
    the same night the students were killed, there was a late night meeting at the DIG’s
    office to plan the cover up. Thereafter intimidation of witnesses with a strong
    Sinhalese hegemonic flavour proceeded shamelessly without any check. Both DIG
    Abeywardene and SP Jayasekere had an STF background.</span></p>
  <p><span lang=EN-GB>Apart from
    the Five Students’ case, Rohan Abeywardene was the presiding DIG during the
    organised communal violence of 12<sup>th</sup> April 2006, when the Police were
    asked to keep off and all telephones of senior officers did not answer. This
    was followed by the ACF incident, also under DIG Abeywardene, remarkable so far
    for the high level cover up which we have documented. Lakshman Seneviratne MP
    said in Parliament on 6<sup>th</sup> June 2007:</span></p>
  <p>“<i>Robberies,
    murders and extortions are going on unchecked in Colombo today.&nbsp; For the
    last several weeks we attempted to find the persons involved in the
    incidents.&nbsp; DIG Rohan Abeywardene who was in charge of the Eastern
    Province is today DIG Colombo. He is a close confidante of Defence Secretary
    Gotabhaya Rajapaksa. I categorically state that they are responsible for what
    is going on in Colombo today.</i>” (<i>The Nation</i> 10 Jun.07.) The DIG
    naturally denied the charge. Those who know his record in Trincomalee would
    find the MP’s charge hard to dismiss (see also Appendix I). DIG Colombo,
    invariably a political appointment, to which Abeywardene succeeded, was at a
    time the State was at its criminal worst. </p>
  <p><span lang=EN-GB>There were
    a number of alerts about the ACF staff stranded in Mutur and unless command
    responsibility is called into force, the ASP and OIC in Mutur at the time are
    not going to say what instructions they received from their superiors in
    Trincomalee. They all knew there were unarmed civilians at the ACF office. The
    ASP and OIC sending two trusted subordinates with Jehangir and the commandos to
    look for Tigers in the ACF office, who then took it into their head to shoot
    the staff, is not going to wash. The commandos who went with them have not, so
    far as we know, been questioned. What instructions they had is crucial to
    assigning degrees of culpability. </span></p>
  <p><span lang=EN-GB>Also of
    importance is the tracing of alerts to the security forces by the various INGOs
    and NGOs on the ACF staff stranded in Mutur on Friday 4<sup>th</sup> August and
    what was done with these alerts. A major cited below was aware and ‘working on
    it’. What did he mean? A meeting of INGOs and NGOs was held at the Trinco UN
    office at 11.00 AM to discuss the stranded staff, before an ACF team set off at
    1.00 PM to try to bring them back. It would be very, very unusual if after the
    discussion the departure of another rescue mission were undertaken without at
    least telephone consultations with the security forces commands in Trincomalee.</span></p>
  <p><span lang=EN-GB>In Special
    Report No.25 we cited ACF sources: “</span><i>On the 4<sup>th</sup> afternoon
    Frank Kano of ACF/ Trincomalee spoke to an army major from its civil affairs
    office. The Major responded that he was aware of the problem and is working on
    it and would get back if he had any information. On the same afternoon, Frank
    Kano went to the office of Nihal Samarakoon, SSP Trincomalee, to hand over a
    list of their staff in Mutur. Although the SSP was not in, the list was handed
    over to an assistant who promised to pass it on</i>.”</p>
  <p><span lang=EN-GB>The
    foregoing is crucial to disentangling what happened, along with the fact that
    by 3.00 PM a message had been sent to the Mutur Police to look after the safety
    of the ACF staff. Was it SSP Nihal Samarakoon who sent that message? Was
    Samarakoon really out of office when the ACF arrived or was he avoiding the
    issue knowing something untoward was taking place? Samarakoon has not been an
    effective officer, nor was he known to be a dirty man. Before answering these
    questions we must say a word about the extraordinary impunity brought into the
    Police Force by the constant interchange of personnel between the Police and
    the STF.</span></p>

lang=EN-GB>12. An STF Mafia within the Police</span></span></span></a></h1>
  <p><span lang=EN-GB>The STF, which
    was formed as a paramilitary force in counterinsurgency by selecting persons
    from the Police, was the initiative of President Jayewardene’s son Ravi in
    1984. From the time it was deployed in the East in early 1985 it quickly earned
    notoriety as ruthless and lawless, beginning with the Thambattai massacre to
    the Kokkadichcholai massacre in 1987, the scores of headless bodies in 1990,
    victims strangled at the STF HQ in lakes in 1995 and the Pottuvil massacre in
    2006. Observers who are careful with their language, readily called the STF
    ‘racist’. After finishing a tour in the STF, men went back to the Police
    supposedly to enforce the law. In referring to colleagues who served in the
    STF, policemen would often grimace and say, “<i>They are that type</i>”. </span></p>
  <p><span lang=EN-GB>In Trincomalee
    during 2006, the balance was tilted heavily towards the STF types. DIG Rohan
    Abeywardene and SP (later SSP) Operations Kapila Jayasekere were from the STF.
    Even so, when a government wants the STF as an institution to play a different
    role, it has the command structure where it could function credibly.
    Unfortunately, the present Government’s outlook dominated by Gotabhaya
    Rajapakse and Defence Advisor Kotakadeniya is geared towards tapping the worst
    traditions of the STF.</span></p>
  <p><span lang=EN-GB>An STF team
    brought into Trincomalee and taking instructions from ex-STF men Rohan
    Abeywardene and Kapila Jayasekere accomplished the exhibition killing of the
    five students on 2<sup>nd</sup> January 2006. The intimidation and racist
    threats against witnesses came from the same quarter. Appointing Maj. Gen.
    T.T.R. de Silva Rtd. to the civil office of Government Agent Trincomalee
    augmented the repressive approach. The ex-STF men among the Police in
    Trincomalee District acted as a mafia and decent policemen were helpless.</span></p>
  <p><span lang=EN-GB>From the
    very top persons who did things policemen should never do were encouraged and
    protected. Ex-STF men exercised their influence in advancing this culture of
    impunity. Kithsiri was an ex-STF man in the Mutur Police during 2006. One of
    his specialities was to organise Muslim home guards to commit atrocities under
    the protection of the security forces.</span></p>
  <p><span lang=EN-GB>Kithsiri
    was behind the incident on 10<sup>th</sup> June 2006, where a Muslim gunman
    boarded the bus in Mutur town and shot dead two passengers including the
    12-year-old-boy Sajeevan. The boy’s <i>sitthi </i>(mother’s younger sister) who
    was a witness was taken away by Kithsiri and threatened not to give evidence.
    But she was very angry and gave the evidence. </span></p>
  <p><span lang=EN-GB>Sub
    Inspector Athula was a good officer who did his duty in apprehending armed Muslim
    elements extorting money from a Saudi NGO. He was transferred out on orders
    from DIG Abeywardene. According to police sources in Mutur, it was Kithsiri who
    was behind the DIG making the transfer.</span></p>
  <p><span lang=EN-GB>Rohan
    Abeywardene and Kapila Jayasekere, must be held responsible for the
    encouragement to criminality throughout the District. Soon after the Mutur
    exodus on 4<sup>th</sup> August 2006, Muslim criminal elements protected by the
    Police in Mutur continued their depredations among the displaced in Katalai
    under the very noses of the Police (see Appendix I). Kantalai is a different
    SSP’s division from Mutur. This could not have happened unless DIG Abeywardene
    wanted it that way. </span></p>
  <p><span lang=EN-GB>Inspector
    D.M. Abeywardene who was OIC Crimes at Mutur was considered a good officer. He
    was helpless. He used to complain to friends that elements having the approval
    of powerful persons were bringing the Police to disrepute, thwarting his
    efforts to keep order. He said that the way things were he was going to get
    transferred.</span></p>
  <p><span lang=EN-GB>It was
    Inspector Abeywardene who was in charge of the successful defence of the Mutur
    police station in the face of the LTTE attack. It is surely galling for him
    that his bravery and achievement in leadership have been tarnished by the ASP
    and OIC who took charge everything was over. They went above him to impose the
    cowardly and abominable crime of the ACF massacre on the Mutur Police. To add
    insult to injury, he was forced to assist in the cover up. This backdrop places
    the crime in perspective.</span></p>

lang=EN-GB>13. Final Pieces of the Puzzle:
    Events of Friday 4<sup>th</sup> August Afternoon</span></span></span></a><span
lang=EN-GB> </span></h1>
  <p><span lang=EN-GB>How does one explain the two seemingly incongruous events on 4<sup>th</sup> August: One, the radio message from the Trincomalee Police to protect the ACF
    staff stranded in Mutur and send them to Trincomalee at 2.30 to 3.00 PM and the
    ASP’s and OIC’s order around 4.00 PM to go and see if there were Tigers at the
    ACF office?</span></p>
  <p><span lang=EN-GB>The answer is that information about the stranded ACF staff was coming
    through two different channels – one benign, and the other potentially
    sinister. It is safe to say that the ACF staff in Mutur did not become a major
    issue until Friday afternoon. Everyone was too preoccupied with their own
    problems. In Mutur itself the fact that the ACF staff had not left with the
    others would have caused some surprise. By then the LTTE was outside town or on
    the fringes and people were moving about.</span></p>
  <p><span lang=EN-GB>Their presence would have reached the Mutur police station through the
    Muslim home guards who were moving in and out and possibly through other police
    informants. It was an unusual development and would have been communicated to
    their superiors in Trincomalee in their regular briefs about the ground
    situation. The emergency was not over. A plan to bring journalists to Mutur on
    Friday was postponed to the next day.</span></p>
  <p><span lang=EN-GB>The second channel was the ACF itself. They had asked the staff to stay
    in the office and had planned to fetch them. We have confirmed that after the
    morning’s meeting in the Trincomalee UN office, one group with expatriate
    officer Elias went towards Mutur with the intention of fetching them. Another
    group with expatriate officer Frank Kano, Alabdeen and Anthony Romulet Perera
    set about the task of obtaining help from the security forces. </span></p>
  <p><span lang=EN-GB>We verified that this group made telephone contact with SSP Nihal
    Samarakoon early in the afternoon and told him about the plight of their
    colleagues. They also made an appointment to meet him and give him the details
    of those in Mutur. We could be quite certain that this was the cause of the
    police message to Mutur police station asking them to take care of those
    stranded. Samarakoon was the SSP in charge of Mutur.</span></p>
  <p><span lang=EN-GB>This message was of a general public character. Inspector D.M.
    Abeywardene was in charge of the radio and the message was heard by several
    people and got around the police station quickly. Inspector Abeywardene would
    routinely have communicated this to the ASP and the OIC. There were other radio
    messages directed to individual officers. In such an event Inspector
    Abeywardene sent for the person, usually the OIC. The OIC then went into a room
    alone leaving his bodyguard outside to answer the call in private.</span></p>
  <p><span lang=EN-GB>We also learnt from police sources that the officers communicating with
    and giving instructions to the Police in Mutur were usually one of SSP
    Operations Kapila Jayasekere and ASP Saman Ratnayake. Inspector Keerthi
    Ranaweera, OIC Administration, Mutur, was also then in Trincomalee, and was
    among those who spoke on the radio.</span></p>
  <p><span lang=EN-GB>As often happens, someone who did the right thing places a crime in
    context, which would otherwise have been a blank. Such is the nature of the
    publicly known radio message from Trincomalee enjoining the protection of the
    ACF staff. It should normally have deterred anyone intending to cause them
    harm, but for the arrogant impunity encouraged by this government among
    sections of the security forces.</span></p>
  <p><span lang=EN-GB>The foregoing strongly suggests that the decision to kill the ACF staff
    was based on local information and exchanges with certain superiors in
    Trincomalee. The radio message enjoining protection was a nuisance that was
    bound to raise questions among many of those present, but was ignored. If not
    for that message it would have been easier to cover up the crime. We reliably
    understand that one of the earlier efforts at a cover up was to write off the
    crime as LTTE cadres killed by Muslim home guards.</span></p>
  <p><span lang=EN-GB>Several factors point to the crime being a deliberate act in the full
    knowledge that the victims were humanitarian workers.</span></p>
  <p><span lang=EN-GB>It was widely felt among the constabulary in Mutur that Home Guard
    Jehangir was intent on killing Tamils on that Friday.  His homicidal disposition on that day featured in discussions
    among policemen. For the ASP and OIC to send Jehangir with two of their
    henchmen and the Special Forces to go and see if there were LTTE at the ACF is
    none other than an instigation to kill. Jehangir was already railing that the
    LTTE were there.</span></p>
  <p><span lang=EN-GB>The ASP and OIC would not have made such a fatal move by themselves
    without instruction and cover provided by DIG Trincomalee. Kapila Jayasekere
    may have been a super SSP who could ignore Nihal Samarakoon, his senior, but an
    ASP tasked with murder would have wanted further guarantee.</span></p>
  <p><span lang=EN-GB>There were no exigencies of war, which might have allowed the
    explanation of the incident as a mishap. There was no fighting in the vicinity
    at that time. No one challenged the party that went to the ACF office at any
    point. The victims were clearly unarmed and were well known in Mutur as
    humanitarian workers. </span></p>
  <p><span lang=EN-GB>It could not have been lost on the ASP and OIC that the ACF premises as
    those of an international humanitarian agency enjoyed quasi-diplomatic status.
    Nor could they complain of an exigency or difficulties of communication, which
    prevented them from communicating with superiors in Trincomalee.</span></p>
  <p><span lang=EN-GB>There was radio communication with facilities to speak confidentially.
    No less importantly, there was ready cell phone access. A cell phone would have
    been part of a senior officer’s equipment. Although the Dialog cell tower in
    Mutur was down, there was ready access to the Trincomalee signal from the
    Police Station, which is close to the sea and across Cottiar Bay. Many of those
    at the Police Station were calling their friends and families on Friday. There
    can be no doubt that the killing party was sent to the ACF after full
    consultation with superiors in Trincomalee.</span></p>
  <p><span lang=EN-GB>When the ACF party in Trincomalee went to meet SSP Samarakoon sometime
    around 4.00 PM in keeping with an appointment already made, he was unavailable.
    This too is strange. It is likely Samarakoon knew that something unpleasant was
    going on.  </span></p>
  <p><span lang=EN-GB>Most such crimes are accompanied by curiosities that seem unimportant at
    first glance, but speak loudly on further reflection. Around midnight on the
    second a policeman was killed by LTTE shelling. His body was to be transferred
    to Trincomalee by sea the following day, 3<sup>rd</sup>, where the post mortem
    was to be done. The Trincomalee Magistrate wanted an order from the Mutur
    Magistrate. Since the latter was at the Police Station, the Police got him to
    view the body and make the order, which he did. </span></p>
  <p><span lang=EN-GB>Early on
    the 5<sup>th</sup> morning, local councillor Ragees saw the ACF bodies in the
    compound and informed ACF Trincomalee about 9.00 AM. The Police certainly knew
    that the talk was getting around. The Mutur Magistrate was still at the Police
    Station, but the Police did not ask him to make the order for the post mortem,
    nor did they protect the site. The tragedy was withheld from the Magistrate who
    left Mutur later in the morning. We have pointed out that ASP and OIC Mutur
    would not by themselves have taken the decision to order or instigate the
    killing of the ACF staff. Who was it in Trincomalee that encouraged them to
    kill? The following information we received to our inquiries brings us very
    close to the answer.</span></p>

    3<sup>rd</sup> to 5<sup>th</sup> August 2006</span></span></span></a></h1>
  <p><span lang=EN-GB>We have
    already said that SSP Jayasekere was in close radio contact with Mutur and what
    we give below suggests that he was given virtually a ball-by-ball briefing and
    consulted minutely on every development.</span></p>
  <p><span lang=EN-GB>On the 3<sup>rd</sup> when the Police in Mutur contemplated evacuation Jayasekere asked them to hold
    on saying the Naval Special Forces were coming to relieve them. There was then
    a move to evacuate the body of the slain policeman with some relatives along
    with the Magistrate. According to police sources Jayasekere and Inspector
    Ranaweera told them to keep the Magistrate until they arrived and that they
    would come soon. The body went, but the Magistrate was kept behind.</span></p>
  <p><span lang=EN-GB>The strange
    developments surrounding the killing of the ACF staff has been described and
    also the celebration and congratulations from the ASP and OIC that followed.
    This was 4.00 to 5.00 PM on the 4<sup>th</sup>.</span></p>
  <p><span lang=EN-GB>SSP
    Jayasekere and Inspector Ranaweera arrived at the Mutur police station about
    midnight on 4<sup>th</sup> August, hours after the ACF massacre. Jayasekere
    slept in what was a sort of reception room. In the morning the SSP was with the
    officer in charge of the commando unit, thought by those present to hold the
    rank of a major. The ACF bodies had been seen early in the morning and the
    Police certainly knew that the talk was getting around. Yet Jayasekere who had
    held the Magistrate back in Mutur did not breathe a word to him about the work
    he had in hand. The bodies lay in the sun and rotted. According to official
    police records, Jayasekere was told about the killings by ACF Trincomalee on
    the 6<sup>th</sup> upon which, the DIG presumably, appointed Jayasekere to
    investigate the crime, bypassing SSP Nihal Samarakoon.</span></p>
  <p><span lang=EN-GB>DIG Rohan
    Abeywardene must explain how he appointed or at least allowed Kapila Jayasekere
    to be in charge of the investigation of both the Five Students’ and ACF cases,
    where Jayasekere was himself the chief object of investigation. The similarity
    of the crimes too could hardly escape notice. In both instances young, unarmed
    Tamils were surrounded and executed after any prospect of escape was
    blocked.   </span></p>
  <p><span lang=EN-GB>Jayasekere
    and DIG Abeywardene need to be investigated very thoroughly in respect of both
    the cases. These two officers along with SSP Nihal Samarakoon are liable in
    virtue of command responsibility. Samarakoon needs to explain himself. Even if
    he was just conning along with some nasty officers, he is as liable. Why did he
    miss the appointment to see the ACF representatives on Friday 4<sup>th</sup> August 2006 afternoon? Did a superior ask him to take a break?</span></p>
  <p><span lang=EN-GB>Further
    issues on both the cases and some testimony will be dealt with in the
    Appendices and the Addendum. </span></p>

  <p><span lang=EN-GB>One thing
    is certain about the ACF killings. They would not have happened if minimally,
    timely disciplinary action had been taken against SP Kapila Jayasekere once his
    role in the Five Students outrage became widely known. Instead he was promoted
    to SSP in July 2006. The ACF killings followed just after – a celebration
    observed by the Mutur ASP and OIC with handshakes. Jayasekere may not have
    spelt out the order for the ACF killings, but in his presence the air in the
    Police Force was reeking with impunity – anyone could do anything. Both
    killings flowed from the same compulsion to kill young Tamils.  </span></p>
  <p><span lang=EN-GB>That brings
    us to the State. For two years it has gone on denying, obfuscating, abusing
    detractors, intimidating or killing witnesses and making matters progressively
    worse. Our envoys like the foreign minister, foreign secretary, minister for
    human rights, attorney general and many more have tried to cover the country’s
    shame with rhetoric – ‘<i>We have our Supreme Court, our judges, our own Police
    Force, Attorney General, forensic pathologists and ballistic experts. We don’t
    need foreign help in investigations that are progressing well</i>’. </span></p>
  <p><span lang=EN-GB>The ACF
    case by itself proves this rhetoric to be empty – not because of local
    incompetence but because of malice. Malice against justice and against the
    minorities. We use the word malice advisedly because it is an unvarying
    condition, with no desire for correction.</span></p>
  <p><span lang=EN-GB>Take the
    Chief Justice’s role as ex-officio chairman of the Judicial Service Commission.
    He had the ACF case transmitted to the Anuradhapura Magistrate after the Mutur
    Magistrate had issued orders in the exercise his investigative function
    (Special Reports 25 and 27). The public senses the true intention of such
    meddling. For one, it scares off witnesses. An important witness Haji Abdul
    Rahuman, who was earlier down to testify, is now missing. A bold local
    magistrate who is strict with the Police can do a great deal for justice and
    this instance, the case was moved out of the locality. There are at least two
    more important instances of the JSC removing magistrates from cases to cover up
    for the security forces (Special Report No. 25 and Appendix III of Special
    Report No.29)</span></p>
  <p><span lang=EN-GB>The
    Attorney General’s Department that has led the evidence at the Commission of
    Inquiry purposefully relied on the distorted evidence and accounts provided by
    the Police. It has not helped in making any honest breakthrough, in contrast
    with the alacrity with which it set out to quash Dodd’s identification of a
    5.56 mm projectile. </span></p>
  <p><span lang=EN-GB>We must
    also question the bona fides of JMO Anuradhapura who was mysteriously imposed
    as pathologist for this case. We now know that the time he put down in the
    inquest reports, </span>‘<i>Most likely in
    the early morning of 04 August 2006</i>’ was very misleading. He must also
    explain the missing original photograph of the ‘5.56 mm’ bullet found in Romila
    at the second autopsy that has remained a subject of controversy. Now that we
    know that Uzi submachine gun and other bullets had also been used that did not
    turn up in the investigation, we must ask if the Anuradhapura JMO removed any
    evidence during the first post mortem.  </p>
  <p><span lang=EN-GB>Further,
    the fact that only one type (7.62 mm) turned up in the investigation, whereas
    the fact that at least three different types of bullets were used, along with
    controversy about the type of bullet found in Romila, questions the integrity of
    the process of collection, preservation and transmission of evidence and
    ballistic analysis.</span></p>
  <p><span lang=EN-GB>As for the
    Police that was directly responsible for the killing of both the Five Students
    and the ACF staff, it has largely ceased to be a police force. In a state that
    has deliberately truncated itself to a Sinhalese State, the Police have been
    increasingly used as its criminal arm.</span></p>
  <p><span lang=EN-GB>The
    hypocrisy about our state institutions has to stop and the fact has to be faced
    that there has been a long history of justice being out of reach especially for
    the minorities, even in respect of sensational crimes that draw world
    attention. This hypocrisy reaches bewildering heights when our Foreign Ministry
    secretary Dr. Kohona, an Australian citizen, articulates Asianness (<i>New York
    Times</i> 9 Mar. 08) as governments who are nice and courteous to each other –
    leave alone however abominably they treat their own people.</span></p>
  <p><span lang=EN-GB>The ACF
    case has been an act of grand perjury where the entire hierarchy down to the
    Attorney General’s Department and Police have misled the evidence. We will not
    insult the AG’s Department by supposing that the truth evaded their
    intelligence. The President disingenuously cited the paucity of witnesses in
    the Five Students case and allowed Kapila Jayasekere to get a promotion. The
    Government has piously refused any foreign role in checking our institutions
    citing their virtues that now lay naked before the world. Who will now see that
    a measure of justice prevails in Sri Lanka?   </span></p>
  <p><span lang=EN-GB>It is not
    without great pain that we appeal to the outside world for justice. In our
    courts and police we had institutions that were working quite well until the
    communal violence of 1977 when the new UNP regime used the Police as an
    instrument of appalling crime against a minority. The institutions never
    recovered since, but deteriorated further. This is not going to change
    overnight and certainly not under this Government. We have no alternative but
    to eat humble pie and accept outside help.</span></p>
  <p><span lang=EN-GB>It abases
    us and hurts our pride and often, for unfair reasons, our self-respect. When we
    had working institutions solving the cases above was routine work. But today
    the criminality of the very institutions that are meant to deliver justice has
    thrown huge barriers against justice and the people are helpless.</span></p>
  <p>In this connection
    we welcome UN Human Rights Commissioner Louise Arbour’s statement on 15<sup>th</sup> January with regard to the Sri Lankan conflict where she pointed out that
    international law prohibited all sides in the Sri Lankan conflict from
    committing unlawful killings or torture, arbitrary detention, recruiting or
    deploying child soldiers, and forcing people out of their homes. She said “<b><i>Violations
    of these rules by any party could entail individual criminal responsibility
    under international criminal law, including by those in positions of command</i></b>.”
    It is now time for her and others of a similar mind to get a move on.</p>

  <p>We received
    important testimony that corroborates aspects of the evidence cited above.
    Every revelation of sensitive evidence at present leaves someone potentially
    vulnerable. We are constantly faced with the dilemma of balancing the public
    good that revelation would bring with the danger faced by witnesses. Young
    Tamils are being targeted by the Defence Ministry’s killers simply because they
    were active or showed some spirit – that is all the 22 victims considered in
    this report were guilty of. The recent case at the end of Appendix II shows how
    little a life counts under this Government. No investigation and even the Press
    too scared to report it. The Tamils certainly need liberation from the Tigers
    but not to live under a regime that is no better.</p>
  <p>After 15 months of
    the Commission of Inquiry there is no meaningful protection for witnesses or
    others. Three witnesses were killed. Haji Abdul Rahuman, a key witness in the
    ACF case, is missing from late 2006 after the Police had identified him as a
    witness. The Police has thoroughly misinformed the CoI about him. Others
    affected in the two incidents have been continually harassed and intimidated
    into leaving the country. Some did not have the means or the will to carry on
    in Sri Lanka. Asylum in a few prominent cases cannot be the solution to a much
    larger problem. This should never be lost sight of.</p>
