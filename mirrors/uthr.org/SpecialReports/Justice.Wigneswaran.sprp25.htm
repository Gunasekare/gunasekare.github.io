or significant experience of your career? </span></b></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;
mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho";color:black'>A:</span></b><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho";
color:black'> I have had several significant incidents, specially when I was up
in the north. It related to episodes with the military as well as the
militants. But what I would like to share with you as a significant experience
relates to a committee meeting we had in Colombo at Shrubbery Gardens in the early
1980s. </span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;
mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho";color:black'>I was in the committee of the
Judicial Officers Association. There was an emergency meeting convened. I had
come all the way from Mallakam to attend the meeting. Several judges had come
for the meeting from all over Sri Lanka. The committee was agitated about the
stoning of the Supreme Court Judges' residences. </span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;
mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho";color:black'>Almost every one of the
committee members wanted to stage a strike. They simply wanted to show their
protest against the manner in which some of the members of the higher judiciary
had been treated. After a lot of heat was generated, a vote was about to be
taken. If taken it would necessarily have been carried through with at least
95% of those present voting for the staging of the strike by judges until steps
were taken against the perpetrators of the high handed act. </span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;
mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho";color:black'>I excused myself for raising a
contrary view. However serious the matter at hand was, judges should not under
any circumstances strike, I said. We were not a trade union. Even if we were to
strike, we should remember that in 1980 a headstrong government that had
received a five sixth majority in parliament had sent so many workers home.
Their families were still suffering. </span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;
mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho";color:black'>The executive could easily
dismiss the judges, call upon some senior lawyers to act for some time and meanwhile
recruit new judicial officers for the original judiciary, which was in all
about 150 in number at that time. I was prepared to go back to Hulftsdorp where
I had practised for 15 years. </span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;
mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho";color:black'>I asked the judges, how many
of them were confident that they could get back to their respective areas and
practice our profession. In any case I said, the committee should not decide
for the entire membership. This was a serious decision to be made. Not an
emotional ad hoc decision at the spur of the moment. </span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;
mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho";color:black'>I had spoken for about 10
minutes. I was prepared to join the others in the strike and face the
consequences if they too were truthfully prepared to face all eventualities.
Someone asked what was the alternative. I said, Superior Court Judges were
quite capable of looking after themselves. They did not need our strike. </span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;
mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho";color:black'>We could pass an unanimous
resolution expressing our shock and utter disappointment at the high handed
acts and the seeming executive lethargy that had followed.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Slowly the members changed their views.
Finally only a strongly worded resolution was passed. A strike was averted. </span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;
mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho";color:black'>A senior judge who was wholly
supportive of the strike, when he met me in the Court of Appeal many years
later (almost a dozen), welcomed me by saying &quot;here comes the man who
broke our strike!&quot; In a country where decisions are more often taken on
emotional grounds bringing untold misery in their wake, I was able to reason
out an alternative. </span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;

color:black'> Many judges plan out their future while still in service. Even
judgements are sometimes tailor-made to attract lucrative after retirement
benefits. I am sorry I have no plans. I work in the present. The future is
always uncertain and would be looked after by He who created me and who has
directed me so far. </span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;
mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho";color:black'>Q: What was the toughest
problem you encountered during your time as a judge? </span></b></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;
mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho";color:black'>A:</span></b><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho";
color:black'> There are two incidents that come to mind. The army had shot at a
disabled driver and killed him at Atchuveli within my jurisdiction at Mallakam.
The army pleaded self-defence but later evidence proved the army had concocted
the defence. </span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;
mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho";color:black'>On examination of the dead
body and the adjunct areas, I was satisfied that it was not what the army had
made it to be. Since the soldiers who shot had admitted to the firing of
ammunition from their respective firearms (in self defence as they said) which
killed the deceased, I wanted the police to arrest them and produce them before
me the next day in the Mallakam courts. </span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;
mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho";color:black'>The next day when I came out
of my official residence, which was just behind the courts, I found several
armed soldiers all over. They were pointing their guns more or less towards me.
Obviously the army was annoyed with me for arresting two of their soldiers. </span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;
mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho";color:black'>Fortunately, as a senior cadet
at Royal College, Colombo, I had handled guns and I did not feel the slightest
perturbance at the sight of guns or at the obvious show of strength and threat.
Many a judicial officer in the north had been completely flustered and rattled
by the malignant militaristic environment that pervaded the Northern Province
at that time. </span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;
mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho";color:black'>In any event we in Mallakam
had faced unprovoked gunshots from helicopters, which landed right at the
entrance to the court house while sittings were on. We had continued sittings
thereafter within minutes of adjournment, thanks to the courageous lawyers and
litigants. </span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;
mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho";color:black'>I went into my chambers and
sent word for the officer in charge of the soldiers. At least 25-30 soldiers
were to be seen around. If I remember right, one Wijeratne, a short stocky officer,
came in. I asked him why such a large contingent of soldiers was present within
the court premises. He said they had come to give security to the two soldiers
taken into custody. I told him that once the police took control of the
soldiers, the security of the soldiers passed onto the police. </span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;
mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho";color:black'>There were an ample number of
policemen under the command of A.S.P. Navaratnarajah and that the soldiers and
their trucks and jeeps were unwanted in the court premises and must immediately
leave the court compound. Wijeratne hesitated. I told him that I gave him just
two minutes to leave the court premises with all his men and vehicles. That was
an order. It was carried out. </span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;
mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho";color:black'>An officer called Rajudeen
thereafter had come to see me but would not inform my staff what business he
had with me. A visitors book that had to be signed by all who wished to see me,
handed over to him to fill in his name and state the reason for seeing me, was
thrown by him to the ground, allegedly. Hence he was not allowed to see me. </span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;
mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho";color:black'>Thereafter the case went on.
Bunty Zoysa came over to look after the interests of the soldiers. But on the
JMO's evidence, the ballistic expert's evidence and the basis of eyewitnesses
evidence, the two soldiers were found to have been involved in cold-blooded
murder. But soon the Attorney General entered a nolle prosequi and the soldiers
were spared a trial in the High Court. They went scot-free. </span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;
mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho";color:black'>The next incident was during
the 1983 July riots. The army had just shot down many persons on the road
without any provocation whatsoever and their bodies were lying at various
places within my jurisdiction. </span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;
mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho";color:black'>Inquirers into sudden deaths
suddenly disappeared. Relatives of deceased contacted me through lawyers. The
police refused to come out of their police stations for fear that there might
ensue clashes between the army and police. </span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;
mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho";color:black'>I spoke to the OIC, Chunnakam
over the telephone and the conversation was as follows: </span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;
mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho";color:black'>&quot;Why aren't you
coming?&quot; </span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;
mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho";color:black'>&quot;We fear the army.&quot; </span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;
mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho";color:black'>&quot;But who told you that
the army is responsible for the shootings?&quot; </span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;
mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho";color:black'>&quot;Sir! They are
responsible.&quot; </span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;
mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho";color:black'>&quot;No. I say people dressed
in army uniforms had committed these murders. So why don't you come?&quot; </span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;
mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho";color:black'>They came. </span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;
mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho";color:black'>I conducted the inquests
personally on all the dead bodies and gave a verdict of homicide in each of them
by persons dressed in army uniforms travelling in such and such vehicles,
giving the vehicle numbers provided to me at the inquests. I directed the
police to investigate as to whom those vehicles belonged to. </span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;
mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho";color:black'>Later, human rights activists
traced the numbers to genuine army vehicles and what happened in Mallakam was
splashed across the globe in human rights journals! </span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;
mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho";color:black'>Q: You spoke of prejudice and
personal agendas interfering with the judicial process on your last day on the
Supreme Court bench. Could you elaborate more on that? </span></b></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;
mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho";color:black'>A:</span></b><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho";
color:black'> It is not my intention to point accusing fingers at any
individuals. But if you ask any lawyer in Hulftsdorp who has some understanding
of what happens in the Higher Judiciary today, he would tell you looking at the
constitution of a bench and the subject matter coming up before that bench, as
to what the outcome would be. </span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;
mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho";color:black'>More often such evaluation
would be correct. How is it possible? It is because the bias, prejudices and
may be personal agendas of individual judges are fairly well delineated, that
it is possible to safely predict. Some judges would be very hard regarding the
same matter when it relates to one set of litigants and very lenient with
others. </span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;
mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho";color:black'>There was this subsequent case
with similar facts to the earlier case. The same judge dealt with the later
case differently compared to the earlier case. The judge, when it was pointed
out to him, said the facts were different. I was told Faiz Musthapha, who
appeared in the later case, in exasperation had said, &quot;Sir, not that the
facts are different. But the voices in support are different!&quot; </span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;
mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho";color:black'>Whatever our personal views
with regard to a counsel may be, we must not forget that counsel appear for and
on behalf of litigants and it is the litigants' interests which are at stake.
Many of us often forget this and allow our personal animosities and prejudices
to take charge of us. Those who have been prosecutors all their life before
joining the higher judiciary, often look at counsel with a jaundiced eye. </span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;
mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho";color:black'>Q: Have you had personal
experience of this prejudice during your tenure at the Supreme Court? </span></b></p>

style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho";
color:black'> Yes. Within few weeks of my coming to the Supreme Court this
judge who was the leader of our bench, when a junior lawyer got up to support a
Fundamental Rights (Article 11) application based on police brutality, asked
the lawyer why he was supporting that application, saying, &quot;After all, you
were assaulted by the police for what you had done. If you had acted properly
the police would never have assaulted you. Why are you wasting our time?&quot;
The junior lawyer was never given a chance to support his application. </span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;
mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho";color:black'>If a similar application was
supported by a senior counsel, this judge would have been tongue-tied, though
his prejudices were perennial. All police acts or administrative acts are fair
and reasonable, seemed to be the presumed viewpoint of those who had acted for
the executive and its allied institutions throughout their professional life
before adorning the higher judiciary benches. </span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;
mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho";color:black'>Q: When you refer to personal

these biases? </span></b></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho";color:black'>A:</span></b><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho";
color:black'> So long as self-interest and self-advancement happen to be the
motivating factors, political elements must per- force creep in. Not that
judges are divided among themselves on strong politico-philosophic viewpoints.
I remember some judges in the District Court used to be classified as pro
landlord judges and others pro-tenant judges. </span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;
mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho";color:black'>That is not the case in the
higher judiciary. All political viewpoints are ultimately geared towards
personal self-advancement. If a person could shift his steps at the right
moment, like Mohammed Ali in the ring, he would attract political patronage
from whichever political quarters he desires. Political slantings are more
often for personal advancement. </span></p>

jettisoned from the appellate courts under any circumstances. So my answer to
your question is, recruit more from minority communities at the initial stages.

organised by the International Bar Association. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>His crackling description
of that most obscene of phenomena, a political judge who remains irrevocably
tainted by his or her political partisanship, comes immediately to mind when

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>One of the very few truly
bold persons to speak out in regard to issues that most in the legal and

in their impact. They reflect the parlous state in Sri Lanka today, of a separate
and independent judicial branch of governance, historically expected to rise
above mundane politics and impartially apply disinterested legal rules to
disputes that may arise between citizens themselves or the citizens and the
State. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>As this columnist has
stated previously, the degeneration of that branch of governance has
implications that go beyond the politicians who have been all collaborators in
this degenerative process. The implications go beyond the equally few
individuals who profess to head civil society in this country. They also go
beyond those miserable souls who head the legal profession or indeed, those
eminent legal personalities who have also participated in this most fundamental
of all betrayals and with regard to whom, accountability ought to be
particularly severe.</span></p>

to make as a basically civilised nation. Justice Wigneswaran's answer to the
question, as to whether he agreed with President Chandrika Kumaratunga's recent
observation that Sri Lanka's judicial system is the most corrupt in Asia, is
therefore very illustrative. He points that, if that were indeed the case, then
the most important remedial measure is that political manipulation of the
