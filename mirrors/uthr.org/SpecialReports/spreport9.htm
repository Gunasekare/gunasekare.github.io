<h3><a name="_Toc515699707"></a><a name="_Toc516743976">SUMMARY</a></h3>
<p>Despite continuing promises made by the Government, any sense of normalcy has 
  not come to the communities of Jaffna. The refusal to initiate institutional 
  reform from within the Army, combined with a deliberate and concerted attempt 
  to evade credible and transparent investigations into cases of missing persons, 
  has created an environment where a variety of human rights violations committed 
  by the Security Forces and the LTTE have increased. Reprisal action by the Army 
  and disappearances following arrest or detention have risen. &quot;Hunting&quot; 
  expeditions, where masked informants point out LTTE suspects who are immediately 
  gunned down by the Army even while being unarmed, have resulted in some innocent 
  civilians being killed and claimed as LTTE. Beatings during round ups, especially 
  if detained for questioning, and sometimes at check points, have only further 
  ingrained a sense of insecurity, especially among rural villages. Arbitrary 
  execution of civilians by the LTTE continues to take hold and threatens anyone 
  who might be seen merely speaking with a member of the Security Forces. In a 
  brutal display of the mentality existing today, both the LTTE and the Army have 
  on occasion publicly displayed the bodies of their victims as a terrifying warning. 
  The need for independent inquiries into questionable deaths of civilians both 
  during and after battles, is desperately needed if the people are to believe 
  that any type of honest rehabilitation is to occur in the future.</p>
<p>Recent incidents involving the Army which are detailed in this Report include 
  the killing of an unarmed man having mental disorders, as well as the shooting 
  of a young woman in an empty street long after a grenade throwing incident had 
  subsided. In one incident parents had been beaten while taking vigil outside 
  a detention centre where their children were held after a round up. Cases presented 
  include labourers killed while returning home from work and men taken from their 
  home and shot on the beach by the Navy with no explanation given to family members. 
  Land mines set by the LTTE and grenades thrown have frequently injured and killed 
  civilians in a continuing demonstration of their absence of concern for the 
  people. One of the most disturbing features of many of these deaths is the habits 
  surrounding cover ups by the Army. Victims were in a number of instances claimed 
  to have been carrying grenades or involved in offensive action, in an attempt 
  to caste a veil over foul play. In several cases, such claims have been denied 
  by witnesses or family members. Civilian deaths due to military operations are 
  further difficult to investigate due to the lack of proper post-mortem facilities 
  and experienced personnel in Jaffna. An investigation of the medical situation 
  in Jaffna as it stands today is found in the Addendum at the end of this Report. 
</p>
<p>LTTE killings serve as a reminder that any talk of critical evaluation or constructive 
  solutions from within the Jaffna community could be followed by strict and repressive 
  silencing. The methods remain the same. Unarmed civilians are executed in or 
  around their family home, after which the body is publicly displayed with a 
  written warning to all &quot;traitors&quot;. In several cases, friends and relatives 
  of victims have given reliable accounts as to why LTTE claims are utter and 
  dangerous nonsense. Those killed may have been seen speaking to a soldier at 
  a checkpoint, may have been frankly honest in their opinion of the LTTE while 
  talking with neighbours or may have simply been a victim of local rumours. After 
  the killing of one man well-known to be openly critical of the LTTE for many 
  years, the community of Point Pedro was left devastated and terrified. Though 
  reprisal killings by the Army have been viewed as on the increase, they remain 
  the exception rather than the norm. But this fact has by no means curtailed 
  the killing and injury of civilians due to grenades and mines detonated by the 
  LTTE.</p>
<p>Vadamaratchy stands out as an example of better discipline and responsibility 
  on behalf of the Security Forces. There has been a genuine concern for the safety 
  of civilians during attacks, sensitivity to their rights and feelings, and greater 
  accessibility. Colonel Wijeratne, the brigade commander, has spent time visiting 
  families and getting to know the community. Unfortunately, this newly found 
  discipline has for the most part, not taken hold within the Army as an institution. 
  Terror continues to be the most visible face of the Army for many of the communities 
  in Jaffna.</p>
<p>So why does the Government remain silent on disappearances? It is suggested 
  here, with good reason, that it is because a significant number of those arrested 
  in Jaffna had died in detention due to torture and indiscriminate assault. </p>
<p>The determination of the people and their courage to stand up and speak their 
  mind alone has the power to bring any sense of stability to Jaffna. Unfortunately, 
  their voice is not often heard. LTTE propaganda abroad has implicitly asserted 
  the view that the people who struggle to hold on to their lives in Jaffna are 
  no longer to be cared for, and that the area today is merely a place where the 
  LTTE can practice its military moves without any regard for the civilian population. 
  But if the Government continues in its failure to implement drastically needed 
  institutional changes within the Army and the Ministry of Defence, Jaffna will 
  remain to be this &quot;free-fire zone&quot; for all parties to the War. The 
  LTTE will continue its suicidal attempts to provoke reprisals. The Army will 
  continue to see disappearances as an acceptable feature of conflict. Statistical 
  data put forth by the Government describing decreases in violations are meaningless 
  or at best of seasonal significance, in the absence of matching institutional 
  change. If a serious commitment to human rights is to be implemented, then the 
  practices of the past and the present must be stopped immediately before they 
  become the norm of the future. A start needs to be made by a policy of providing 
  recognition and positive support for officers who have demonstrated a capacity 
  for benignant transformation.<a href="#a"> [Top]</a></p>
<h3><a name="_Toc515699708"></a><a name="_Toc516743977">JAFFNA: A VISION SKEWED</a></h3>
<h3><a name="_Toc515699709"></a><a name="_Toc516743978">0: Introduction</a></h3>
<p>In its recent statement on the human rights situation in Jaffna, Amnesty International 
  had placed the number of persons missing after being detained by the armed forces 
  at 676. Interestingly, this figure has been implicitly substantiated in Sri 
  Lankan Ambassador Janaka Nakkawita's statement at the 53rd Session of the UN 
  Commission on Human Rights on 27th March 1997. He said that of the 1652 complaints 
  received up to 28th February 1997 from sources including the ICRC, UNWG on Disappearances 
  and MPs, 857 were found to be duplications and of the remainder 72 have been 
  traced. Even if 80% of the 676 could be traced, it would still place Sri Lanka 
  in the top league for missing persons. In the face of this it is surprising 
  to find the Government doing little that is tangible beyond making statements 
  of good intention. For example the ambassador told UNCHR that the Human Rights 
  Task Force that reports to the president was in the process of establishing 
  its tenth regional office in Jaffna. This talk had been in the air since September 
  last year and the HRTF did make a preliminary visit to Jaffna. But nothing happened. 
  Talk then was around that the HRTF is to be superseded by a Human Rights Commission 
  and the list of names of commissioners was made public. To date there has been 
  a complete blank with regard to the commission's activities. Legal proceedings 
  into violations by service personnel remain a story of promises and anticlimaxes 
  in the same tradition.</p>
<p>This lack of headway on the part of the Government's effort on reversing the 
  trend can be partly explained by sheer inefficiency and the lack of support 
  it gives to officers who have demonstrated a capacity take independent initiatives 
  towards improvement. For one thing the political establishment or the cabinet 
  of ministers hardly seem to think about the ramifications of this problem. Far 
  too much initiative has already been surrendered to the Defence Ministry, which 
  is still controlled by the old guard whose general approach is to cover up rather 
  than seriously investigate violations and take firm action against the offenders. 
  Not knowing what government policy is, if there is indeed one, officialdom moves 
  only on definite orders from the president ahead of each step, on what ought 
  to be routine matters. These small token steps too come usually on the heels 
  of concerted local and international pressure following a major incident that 
  gets into the news. </p>
<p>Another aspect of it stems from practices long associated with the Army that 
  ultimately relies on terror to the detriment of any fresh political initiative. 
  The actions of the Army in different parts of the Jaffna peninsula, and its 
  relations with civilians have a revealing continuity with practices that took 
  shape during the early months following the Army's take-over of Jaffna. Relations 
  in Vadamaratchy remain exemplary. Even with current disappearances at a low 
  ebb, relations in Thenmaratchy are a matter for no little concern. The lack 
  of information about missing persons is, as we have argued, deliberate and purposeful. 
  We shall return to this after shifting our focus to other related matters. Disturbingly, 
  the recent record indicates an increasing tendency towards reprisal action against 
  civilians. At the same time, in a continuing demonstration of its absence of 
  concern for the people, the LTTE continues throwing grenades and detonating 
  land mines in the hope of provoking such reprisals. Where civilians are not 
  killed or injured in reprisals, they most certainly become casualties due to 
  these initial explosions. The routine manner in which acts of homicide and murder 
  by the security forces is covered up bodes ill for future developments. The 
  families of victims are too vulnerable to pursue the matter further and Defence 
  Ministry press releases are fated to be the last word in these instances.<a href="#a">

<h3><br>
  <a name="_Toc515699710"></a><a name="_Toc516743979">1: The general situation</a></h3>
<p>The fact that the Army has made significant efforts at certain levels to distance 
  itself from the past has been recently acknowledged by two prominent citizens 
  in Jaffna as quoted in the press. They had spoken to the effect that 'the Army 
  is doing a difficult job very well'. The Roman Catholic Bishop is also quoted 
  as having said that there had been no major violations since last November when 
  two cases involving rape and murder by soldiers were publicised. This perception 
  is widely held at one level. We record below one known instance of reprisals 
  involving the death of two civilians and injury to several others on 29th January. 
  The Major General commanding the 51st Div. later apologised to the people and 
  promised to punish the offenders. Certain practices have also been adopted to 
  make the Army more disciplined in its dealings with civilians. It seems the 
  general pattern that soldiers wanting to search civilian houses after nightfall 
  do so only in the company of a civilian official - the local headman (GS). Alternatively 
  they surround the house and wait until daybreak. In Jaffna town itself the situation 
  is considered quite normal. The Town Commandant, Brigadier Jayasundera, is readily 
  accessible on the phone to civilian officials and is said to at least investigate 
  complaints. Receipts are also issued for arrests under his command.(Elsewhere, 
  we have reports that it is followed in some areas.) In other areas too army 
  commands have been known to be responsive, even if belatedly. Early this year 
  a pregnant woman in Thenmaratchy facing a medical emergency died on the way 
  to Jaffna hospital owing to delays at checkpoints. Following representations 
  to the authorities, one could now travel about 7 miles from Chavakacheri to 
  Mamapalam Junction near the town with minimum delay.</p>
<p>Yet at many other levels a certain passive resentment is building up which 
  owes to the lack of improvement, stagnation or even deterioration in aspects 
  of the general outlook. Often the dominance of security considerations has ceased 
  to have meaning. The Defence Ministry, the effective ruling power in Jaffna, 
  is seen as having ceased to think or as being simply cussed. Every activity 
  from the transportation of medicines to small village level programmes need 
  clearance from this Ministry. Someone carrying a 4 months supply of pressure 
  tablets (not always readily available in Jaffna) for personal use would be asked 
  to leave these behind at Ratmalana Airport. Visitors to Jaffna are still allowed 
  only in a controlled and selective manner. Some international human rights groups 
  who wanted to visit Jaffna had been told that 'it is not convenient'.</p>
<p>Approval for the MSF which was already in Point Pedro to send medical specialists 
  to Jaffna Hospital was delayed for nine months and approved only recently. We 
  understood on good authority that the main reason was the MoD seeing foreign 
  doctors from organisations of this kind as meddling too much in human rights 
  matters.(See addendum on Jaffna hospital.)</p>
<p>The Jaipur Foot manufactory under the Friends in Need Society, Jaffna, was 
  sent materials after USAID had spent 6 months obtaining approval from the MoH 
  and MoD in Colombo. Upon reaching Jaffna the military authorities there returned 
  to Colombo some of the materials including cylinders, that are used in making 
  new legs for the war-maimed. (The society continues to improvise cylinders by 
  stripping aluminium bodies of the abandoned buses.) Such procrastination on 
  basic things run entirely counter to flowery promises about revitalising Jaffna. 
  The resulting uncertainties about the Government's attitude to Jaffna, combined 
  with a hostility towards Jaffna coming alive under Government control on the 
  part of an influential section of Tamils outside, help to perpetuate an air 
  of pessimism among the residents.</p>
<p>To the residents and users of Jaffna town the frequency and manner in which 
  checkpoints are operated has become a sore point. Civilians need to dismount, 
  remove their hat if they were wearing one, and roll their bicycles or motor-cycles 
  past the soldiers - a practice observed by oppressed castes in the past when 
  passing high caste persons. The effect of doing this day after day even on very 
  balanced minds should not be underestimated. An intellectual who had been a 
  consistent opponent of the LTTE and politically a Leftist, as distinct from 
  a nationalist, observed, &quot; At least once in twenty days I cannot help wondering 
  if after all the Tigers are right!&quot;</p>
<p>The main reason for the high frequency of check-points as one approaches town 
  seems to be that the army high-command has taken over buildings in the town-centre 
  to site its head-quarters. This is not the case in Vadamaratchy and Thenmaratchy 
  where the brigade command centres are away from the commercial areas. By May, 
  there was a significant easing of the tedium of check points, notably outside 
  Jaffna town. Some of them had also been closed owing to a transfer of troops 
  to support the ongoing operations in the Vanni.</p>
<p>Despite a surface calm, the occasion on which a schoolboy gets assaulted by 
  a soldier at a sentry point or during a round up is enough to set off undercurrents 
  whose course would be unpredictable. For the present these remain unnoticed, 
  and the military authorities are largely oblivious to such matters. This is 
  reflected in the indifferent manner in which civilian dignity is being trodden 
  upon in parts of Thenmaratchy in contrast to the early weeks following the Army's 
  entry in April 1996.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the army captain in Chavakacheri placed in charge of 
  civil affairs is described as someone who speaks neither Tamil nor English, 
  does not entertain those who cannot speak Sinhalese, and whose use of the latter 
  is generously spiced with abuse. The top brass are described as almost inaccessible, 
  and of probably not wanting to meet civilians. In the rural areas military decisions, 
  against which there is no appeal, could be even more alienating and more arbitrary. 
  On approaching the Colonel in charge at Kachchai, in Thenmaratchy South, the 
  lady principal of Allarai GTM school was refused permission to hold the annual 
  sports-meet. The reason was that she could not provide details of persons who 
  were attending. The lady's position was that such a request could not be complied 
  with as it was a public function. On another occasion the same Colonel went 
  into Kachchai Central School where students were training for the District Drill 
  Display Competition, shouted at the teacher in charge, asking him whether he 
  was training Tigers, and forbade further training. The competition organised 
  by the Education Department is a regular event in which most schools take part.</p>
<p>Such developments, though relatively isolated they may be, must be seen in 
  the context of procrastination and the absence of meaningful action on the missing 
  persons issue and the rising tendency to reprisal action.</p>
<p>Another practice whose deep significance is not so evident at present is the 
  display of bodies of LTTE cadre killed in public places. This happens in places 
  such as Valikamam West where the LTTE maintains a tenuous, but sizeable, clandestine 
  presence. The Army too receives information quite freely and launches what are 
  described as 'hunting' expeditions. The informant wearing a mask and dressed 
  in military uniform is taken on the pillion of a motor cycle or in an armoured 
  vehicle. As soon as the person or persons are pointed out, the soldiers open 
  fire. Few chances are taken and those killed are frequently off-guard, unarmed 
  and in no position to offer resistance. One place where their bodies are regularly 
  displayed is Suthumalai Road junction in Manipay, where William Mather Memorial 
  Church is sited. The people see those killed as ignorant boys who in response 
  to bombing and shelling, or in an unwitting moment, joined the LTTE - who did 
  not deserve such an end, and certainly not such humiliation in death. The display 
  is also no doubt a warning. The connotations of such actions in an ethnic conflict 
  act as a hindrance to the Tamils believing that the Government seeks political 
  accommodation on terms of equality and mutual respect.</p>
<p>Moreover such counter-insurgency strategies take away from the consideration 
  and respect owed to civilians, even when responding to LTTE attacks. Although 
  the number is still small in relation to the mid-80s, in comparison with last 
  year, there has been in recent months, a rising incidence of civilians getting 
  hurt or killed in Army action following LTTE attacks. The Army puts them all 
  down to cross-fire, whereas, as our reports indicate, in a number of cases this 
  is simply not true. In the case of the school-boy shot dead by the army in Anaikottai 
  on 8th April following an LTTE grenade attack, there was a big turnout at the 
  funeral, indicative of a mood of protest. Passive protest is also in such instances 
  hinted at in condolence notices in the press signed 'School Welfare Society 
  &amp; Old Students' Association'.</p>
<p><br>
  We have also cases in this report where ordinary civilians had been killed and 
  later claimed as Tigers carrying grenades. In some cases the families had also 
  been placed under pressure to endorse the false claim.It is far too premature 
  to say that normality or civil administration has returned to Jaffna. Many in 
  the rural areas with little interest in politics do say that it is not possible 
  to live with the Army. Round ups are regular and even the old are kept in schools 
  for a good part of the day without food or water. Those taken for questioning 
  are routinely beaten. Frequently different sections of the Army have the same 
  information about a person once connected with the LTTE, resulting his being 
  continually beaten and released by different units coming in to the area. In 
  such instances the parents are extremely anxious to send their sons abroad because 
  they are always on pins. This makes any kind of planned existence impossible 
  for the people, a number of whom have been displaced as many as eight times 
  during the course of the war.<a href="#a"> [Top]</a></p>
<h3><a name="_Toc515699711"></a><a name="_Toc516743980">2: Reports of incidents</a></h3>
<p>These detailed reports are meant to give a general idea and speak for themselves. 
  <br>
  Point Pedro (Vadamaratchy): 27th Novemebr 1996 (National Heroes Day):<br>
  The day was tense as talk had been around that the LTTE would do something to 
  celebrate its leader's birthday. About 6.10 a.m. firing noises and a grenade 
  explosion were heard in the suburb of Thumpalai. The people of the area lay 
  flat on the ground for about 45 minutes. A lady then ventured out cautiously 
  and found Mr.Yogarajah's house full of soldiers. This is what had happened: 
  Yogarajah is a seaman who had come home on vacation and was at home with his 
  wife and five daughters. About 5 a.m. there was a knock on the door. Upon opening 
  he encountered LTTE cadre asking to enter the house. Yogarajah protested, since, 
  to begin with, no one with girls likes to entertain strangers at that hour. 
  The LTTE boys persisted and appeared to be nervous. Yogarajah allowed them inside. 
  Two boys climbed into the ceiling. A little later there was a second knock and 
  this time it was the Army. The officer asked Yogarajah if there were any LTTE 
  cadre in the house, to which Yogarajah replied in the negative. As the soldiers 
  were moving away, there was a noisy crash through the ceiling and one cadre 
  fell onto the ground. The soldiers came rushing back and the person on the ground 
  was shot dead. The house was then surrounded and the family of the house was 
  asked to come out. Soldiers then climbed the roof and began removing some of 
  the tiles. Firing noises and a grenade explosion were heard and the second Tiger 
  in the ceiling died swallowing cyanide. </p>
<p>It turned out that the two dead Tigers were from the same area. One had his 
  father in Germany and the mother and the rest of the family in the Vanni. The 
  father's brother was later questioned by the Army. The second was a Brahmin 
  and a grandson of Rathina Iyer. The new pattern seems to be for the LTTE to 
  send in people of the same area who may find survival easier. Yogarajah was 
  taken by the army and released the same day after questioning. Four days later 
  he was arrested again. Colonel Larry Wijeratne, the brigade commander, visited 
  one of the daughters who was in grade 10 at Methodist Girls' School and assured 
  her that the father would be unharmed. Arrangements too were made for the family 
  to exchange letters. At the time of writing his release was said to be imminent.</p>
<p>Mulli Junction (Thunnalai, Vadamaratchy): 18th January 1997: What follows is 
  the final tragedy that overtook an innocent man. Krishnalingam (43) was a valuation 
  officer. Having studied at Maradana Technical College, he followed a course 
  in quantity surveying in the UK, which he had not completed because he had a 
  blackout after which he returned home. He found employment as a government quantity 
  surveyor, married and was stationed in Galle during the 1983 communal violence. 
  His trauma in the wake of the violence was exacerbated owing to his already 
  vulnerable condition. He went to Point Pedro as a refugee. But his wife returned 
  to Colombo with her parents soon after the riots. But he had refused to leave. 
  His marriage was under strain. But a reconciliation was brought about around 
  1990. Krishnalingam however returned to Point Pedro towards the latter part 
  of last year after the Army took control of the area. He reported to the valuation 
  department in Jaffna. But the authorities in Colombo said that he should report 
  there. He lived with his mother giving tutions in English and Mathematics. He 
  was a short, stout person who also knew Karate. He was a devout Hindu. On occasions 
  when he was mentally disturbed, he would go on a pilgrimage on foot visiting 
  several temples, often staying at the Chella Channanithi temple pilgrim's rest, 
  Thondamanaru, for several days. </p>
<p>On the Thursday before he died, a lady relative who came to visit her mother 
  called Krishnalingam and gave him a message from his wife. The same evening 
  Krishnalingam went to the house of a friend, waited for sometime and left, since 
  the friend was late in coming home. The same night he told his mother, 'mother 
  I want some peace', and went to Puttalai Pillayar Kovil on foot. Such things 
  he had been doing despite the prevailing curfew. On Friday morning he went to 
  Vallipuram temple. On Saturday morning he set off along the Point Pedro - Kodikamam 
  road towards Chuttipuram temple which was one of his favourite haunts. He was 
  only carrying a shoulder bag. At the Mulli junction sentry point (4th mile post) 
  he was shot dead by a soldier. He had received shots in the neck and head. The 
  'Daily News' quoting the military version reported that the army doing a clearing 
  operation in Thunnalai had fired at an LTTE terrorist who had a grenade in his 
  possession. Krishnalingam's relatives who came for the funeral from Colombo 
  raised the matter with Colonel Larry Wijeratne pointing out that Krishnalingam 
  was certainly not a terrorist but a patient, and would never have carried a 
  grenade in his bag. They also said that had he been difficult at the check point, 
  since there were several soldiers around, they could have easily brought him 
  under control and that there was no necessity to shoot him. They added that 
  if it had come to the worst, they could have shot him in the legs rather than 
  in the head. Wijeratne promised to look into the matter and had taken a statement 
  from the soldier who shot Krishnalingam. The soldiers' version was that he had 
  refused to show his bag at the check point and had become physically aggressive. 
  According to Colonel Wijeratne, he had issued strict instructions not to shoot 
  at civilians. We shall see that claims about the dead victim having a grenade 
  is a common ruse in cover ups. </p>
<p>Krishnalingam had a problem which many psychiatric patients face. When feeling 
  better, they often stopped taking their pills and consequently become aggressive. 
  Having experienced the 1983 communal violence in the South, Krishnalingam had 
  developed a strong attachment to Vadamaratchy as his home, where he was free 
  as he could never be elsewhere. Friends have often seen him in the market buying 
  supplies for his brother's family on the other side of the bund, while most 
  people are reluctant to cross the bund. Krishnalinagam has been heard to remark, 
  &quot; Who are these fellows to stop me from going where I want to go in my 
  own home&quot;.</p>
<p>Ponnalai (Vallikamam West): 29th January 1997: In the morning a group of fisherfolk 
  from Moolai were moving towards Ponnalai causeway for their day's work. When 
  they came close to the military post at the junction a mine exploded. In what 
  followed nine civilians and a soldier were killed. Six women were injured. A 
  statement was issued by the Tamil parties presently in Jaffna to the effect 
  that the death of civilians took place because of soldiers firing into them. 
  An army spokesman in Jaffna later told the Tamil parties that their statement 
  which was published in the 'Sunday Observer' was incorrect because the mine 
  which exploded had been suspended from a tree and that the civilians were killed 
  by the mine explosion, which because of it its position above the ground, had 
  a wider spread. The soldiers, he claimed, had fired upwards towards the tree 
  and not at the ground towards the fisherfolk. He also said that they could check 
  with the hospital authorities who in the course of the post-mortem had not found 
  bullets. A Tamil party spokesman said that this was possibly true since the 
  survivors who were in a state of shock had heard firing noises and had thought 
  the bullets were fired at them. Since doubts remain, the matter deserves a fuller 
  inquiry. (See addendum on Jaffna hospital.)</p>
<p>Puttur: 10th February 1997: About 9.00 in the morning an army patrol was returning 
  to Puttur along the Kodikamam Road. They were about 300 yards from the check 
  point which was around a bend. Normally army patrols take the precaution of 
  moving in single file where 20 men would stretch over about 100 yards of the 
  road. Perhaps, being close to home, they had lost their caution and were bunched 
  together like a crowd of boys after a film show. This had evidently been observed 
  by the LTTE a number of times. The soldiers also had a prisoner, Kandasamy Sasikumaran, 
  a boy of 16, carrying a helmet in his hands. As the soldiers approached a small 
  bridge an LTTE man who was observing them signalled to three others who while 
  hidden out of sight of the soldiers, pressed the plunger. For sometime there 
  was only a pall of smoke accompanied by firing from the soldiers. When the smoke 
  cleared soldiers who had hidden in neighbouring houses came onto the road and 
  firing noises ceased. Two soldiers lay dead on the road while an injured man 
  signalled with his hand. A vehicle quickly came form the camp and took away 
  the dead and the injured. The young man whom the soldiers had been holding prisoner 
  was also seen by local civilians coming onto the road, holding the helmet. The 
  soldiers then turned nasty and brutally assaulted civilians in the area. One 
  man was pleading on his knees while a soldier held him by the hair and beat 
  him with a thick piece of wood. As five women came out of the house in which 
  they were hiding, they were shot in the legs. (Fortunately these turned out 
  to be only flesh wounds.) Three dead bodies were later brought to Jaffna Teaching 
  Hospital. Two were of civilians. One was a civilian killed by the army in reprisals 
  at the neighbouring camp of Sirupiddy. Another was of the 16 year old boy prisoner. 
  The third was of the LTTE cadre who had given the signal. While escaping he 
  had run into soldiers moving towards the location, and had swallowed cyanide.</p>
<p>The 16 year old boy used to come to Puttur East every day from Watharavattai 
  to purchase bread for some families in his village. On this morning the army 
  had taken him suspecting him of supplying bread to the LTTE. It is understood 
  that the post-mortem report by Jaffna hospital stated that the boy bearing several 
  injuries, had died in the mine blast. But we have firm testimony that he was 
  seen after the mine explosion. (See addendum on Jaffna hospital.) The boy had 
  apparently been brutally done to death. The matter was later taken up with Major 
  General Balagalle by the EPDP. The General came and apologised to the people, 
  promised that such incidents will not happen again and that the offenders will 
  be punished. A lady in the village later observed sarcastically, &quot;The big 
  man came and apologised to us. The dead came alive, and it all ended well!&quot;</p>
<p>The other three Tigers who were involved in the operation were later seen in 
  the locality by a civilian. He asked them, &quot;Why do you set off mines where 
  civilians are living, making life impossible for us?&quot; The Tigers replied 
  to the effect that there was nothing else they could do and so they had to do 
  this. </p>
<p><br>
  Kokkuvil/Thavady:24th February 1997: A man was travelling along the Anaikkottai-Kulappiddy 
  road when he was called by a man dressed in a neat shirt and sarong. The latter 
  asked the traveller if he knew him. The traveller recognised him to be Kulatheepan, 
  the LTTE's Vanni GA, whose responsibilities had included collecting taxes from 
  vehicles bringing supplies into the Vanni. The traveller told him, &quot;The 
  people are tired of this war, they cannot take any more. Why do you not go for 
  peace talks?&quot; Kulatheepan replied, &quot;You wait two weeks and everything 
  will be made clear.&quot; The traveller noticed that Kulatheepan was surrounded 
  by a guard, members of which had taken up positions around him and were on the 
  look out for the army. The traveller then asked him, &quot;Do you know that 
  there is a God above watching everything?&quot; Kulatheepan thought a little 
  and responded, &quot;Yes I believe that there is a superior power above us&quot;. 
  The two soon parted company, each going his own way. The traveller had been 
  afraid that had he prolonged his stay someone would have seen them together 
  and informed the army.</p>
<p>The next day however Kulatheepan met his death. Kulatheepan and his superior, 
  Senthamil, who was the political leader for Jaffna were ambushed by the army 
  at 6.45 a.m. near Pathirakali Amman temple, Thavady. Also killed in the army 
  firing was Kandiah Sivashanmuganathan(41), a merchant and father of two boys, 
  15 and 7 years, and a girl of 14. He was passing that way to his shop. The bodies 
  were taken to Jaffna hospital where Sivashanmuganathan's wife and a child identified 
  his body. The Police refused them permission to remove the body saying that 
  it had belonged to a member of the LTTE. </p>
<p>Towards the end of February travellers passing by saw a horrifying sight. A 
  severed head was placed on three stones near Kulappiddy junction. According 
  to local talk, this was the head of a soldier who had fallen into the hands 
  of the LTTE when he went alone to obtain a drink of toddy. Such acts have been 
  perpetrated by both sides. There have been reports that in the same area at 
  least on two occasions heads of LTTE cadre who had fallen into the hands of 
  the Special Forces had been severed and placed in front of their parents' houses. 
</p>
<p>Thenmaratchy West: Mid-March 1997: Troops rounded up an area about 3 miles 
  in circumference including parts of Maravanpulavu, Navatkuli, Kaithady &amp; 
  Koilakandy and all - old and young - were taken to a school. Except for 20 young 
  persons, the rest were later asked to go back. The parents and relatives of 
  those detained refused to return, despite some of those refusing to go being 
  beaten by angry soldiers. A masked person was then brought in an auto, who cleared 
  all those detained. The latter were then released in the presence of the local 
  headman.<br>
  <br>
  Jaffna Convent:3rd May 1997: In the morning at 6.45 a grenade was thrown by 
  two Tigers at the security post by the water tank across Main Street from Holy 
  Family Convent, Jaffna. One policeman was injured, but not too badly. The Tigers 
  who had thrown the grenade ran into an army truck while trying to get away and 
  were shot dead. The streets naturally emptied. Pathmarajah Sudharshini(20), 
  a young girl who had gone to church in the morning when returning home was perhaps 
  the first civilian to venture into that area. This was about 20 minutes after 
  the incident. She was shot at by security personnel, was injured and was taken 
  to the intensive care unit at the JTH. Upon investigating the incident the EPDP, 
  EPRLF, &amp; PLOTE discovered that the shooting of the girl took place well 
  after the excitement. They subsequently had a meeting with Brigadier Jayasundera, 
  the Town Commandant, and urged him to set up a committee of inquiry into the 
  incident.<a href="#a"> [Top]</a></p>
<h3><a name="_Toc515699712"></a><a name="_Toc516743981">3: Instances of civilian 
  death or injury resulting from military action</a></h3>
<p>The following gives a sample of cases: (See also A Note on Military Operations)</p>
<p>Meesalai:18th December 1996: Kandiah Vijayanathan(21) was taken in a round 
  up and detained at Chavakachcheri. He was later found shot dead with an injury 
  at the back of the neck. The Army claimed that he had been shot while attempting 
  to escape.</p>
<p>Karainagar: 11th January 1997: Thevarajah Vigneswaran (22) and Somasundaram 
  Sivakumar (22) were shot dead by the Navy about 8:30 p.m. The official (navy) 
  version is that the two were walking along the seashore during curfew hours 
  and did not heed a call to stop. The truth is of course very different.<br>
  The two had no LTTE connection, were close to the navy, were well known to them, 
  and the second was close to the EPDP if not a member. The first had a shop close 
  to the navy camp that was patronised by its personnel and the families had been 
  pro-security forces in their outlook. The house of the first was supplied with 
  electricity by the navy and other neighbours came there in the nights to watch 
  TV and videos. Curfew was only formal and people moved about freely inland. 
  The first was married to a charming lady and the second who lived about 200 
  yards away was to marry a sister of the first.<br>
  <br>
  On the day in question the two men, the ladies and several neighbours, including 
  children, had watched a video and the two men came to the entrance of the home 
  of the first, intending to go to a friend's to dine. To everyone's surprise 
  naval personnel came there, took the men away to the beach and shot them in 
  the head. An inquiry was held but nothing came of it, although the EPDP had 
  said that it would press the matter. The EPDP's 'Thinamurasu' of Jan. 19th-25th 
  while stating the navy's claim, added that Mr. Baskaran, MP EPDP, &quot;brought 
  this [the murders]to the notice of the authorities&quot;.</p>
<p>It was speculated locally that some naval personnel had entertained designs 
  on the two women. But on that night the naval personnel had not come into the 
  house although the women were there. The navy now provides rations to the families 
  of the victims. Some who were there have admitted privately that they could 
  identify the navy personnel who committed the crime, but had told the inquiry 
  the contrary - the navy was after all the law in Karainagar. As in many similar 
  cases the official version remains the last word on the matter, and that happens 
  all too easily.</p>
<p>Ponnalai:17th January 1997: Ratnasabapathy Vigneswaran(40) was shot through 
  the back of his head at 1 a.m. No further information other than that the body 
  was found. Needs further investigation. </p>
<p>Kokkuvil: 23rd January 1997: Rasalingam Ratnasingam (45), father of four, was 
  shot dead by the army while returning home in the evening.</p>
<p>Putthur:10th February 1997:(see above)</p>
<p>Sangaratthai, Valikamam West: 28th February 1997: Troops in ambush at Sinnappu 
  School shot dead two labourers returning home about 6:45 p.m. They were Nagamutthu 
  Rajendram (40), father of three, and Krishnan Perampalam (32), father of four. 
  The families who went to Mavady camp the following day were told that the two 
  were killed because they were carrying grenades. When they visited the scene, 
  they only found a bag with a smashed coconut sprout (pooraan). The latter is 
  normally consumed by poorer folk. </p>
<p>Chankanai, Valikamam West: Mid-March: Nadarajah, a car broker past middle age, 
  went to his sister's place in the evening to obtain some curries for dinner. 
  While returning he was shot dead by soldiers. When relatives, including the 
  sister and her husband, went to the Army regarding this matter, they were asked 
  to sign a declaration that the deceased had been a member of the LTTE.</p>
<p>Nacchimar Kovil, Jaffna: 17th March 1997: Pakianathan Aingaran (18), student 
  of St. Henry's, Illavalai, was killed when troops travelling in an armoured 
  vehicle opened fire upon hearing an explosion. Two others were injured.</p>
<p>Karainagar: 29th March 1997: A youth, Tharmarajah Janarthanan, was shot dead 
  by the Navy. According to the Navy the youth was shot after he threw a grenade 
  during a search operation conducted by them. The Thinamurasu (Apr. 6-12th) quoted 
  the parents as saying that the naval personnel who entered their home just after 
  mid-night had ordered them out and interrogated their son. Gunshots were heard 
  subsequently.</p>
<p>Alaveddy:7th April 1997: Sivarajah Manivannan of Arunachalam Vidyalayam, Alaveddy, 
  &quot;died under tragic circumstances&quot;- press notice in the Uthayan by 
  the School Welfare Society and the Old Students' Association.(The form of the 
  notice indicates that he was killed in a firing incident and we have no further 
  details.)</p>
<p>Anaikkottai:8th April 1997: Kanapathippilai Pratheepan (16,O/Level) of Balasubramaniam 
  Vidyalayam, Anaikkottai was shot dead at mid day when the army fired back in 
  response to a grenade thrown by the LTTE. The body was collected from Jaffna 
  Hospital after identification by parents, the school principal and teachers. 
  There was a massive turn out at the funeral. The EPDP called for a judicial 
  inquiry.</p>
<p>Thinnevely East: 20th April 1997: Nithyanantharajah Pushpalatha (31), mother 
  of two, was injured in the stomach and a leg during the shooting incident at 
  2:30 a.m. Her husband had been killed by the IPKF in 1988.</p>
<p>Malusanthy, between Manthikai &amp; Nelliady, Jaffna Road, Vadamaratchy: 22nd 
  April (approx.): The LTTE shot dead two soldiers whom they had apparently observed 
  going to drink toddy for some time. Troops then assaulted several civilians 
  in the area. Colonel Wijeratne who was away during the incident is said to be 
  trying to trace those assaulted.</p>
<p>Jaffna Convent:3rd May 1997:(See report above)</p>
<p>Irupalai: 3rd May 1997: Kandiah Selvaratnam (58), a coconut plucker, lost a 
  leg by treading on a minefield meant to protect an army post in Vithanayar Lane.</p>
<p>Between Chunnakam &amp; Mallakam: Mid-May 1997: An LTTE mine explosion claimed 
  the lives of 4 soldiers travelling in a tractor and a civilian passer-by. In 
  the sequel about 60 civilians were assaulted by soldiers. In a statement, Major 
  General Balagalle, apologised for the assault and promised appropriate punitive 
  action against those responsible.</p>
<p>Manipay, Anaikottai, Suthumalai, Kokkuvil: 19th, 20th May 1997: Firing noises 
  and grenade explosions were heard in this area. A civilian Kathiravelu Suresh 
  (33) and his wife Jamuna (24) were hit by gunfire. The former was killed and 
  the latter was taken to Palaly base to be treated. Four other unidentified bodies 
  were brought to Jaffna hospital.</p>
<p>Inuvil West: 20th May 1997: Kandasamy Rathinamma, an old woman, was shot dead 
  when she went into her compound holding a lamp at 4:30 a.m. to ease herself. 
  Her body was handed over to Jaffna hospital by the Chunnakam Police with several 
  gunshot injuries in her chest. <a href="#a">[Top]</a></p>
<h3><a name="_Toc515699713"></a><a name="_Toc516743982">4: Killings by the LTTE</a></h3>
<p>5th January 1997: G.W.Piyadasa(65), a Sinhalese who had been resident in Jaffna 
  for 40 years was shot dead by the LTTE near Innuvil junction. He was accused 
  of having contact with the army and giving information. The LTTE notice further 
  asked people not to have contact with the army whether willingly or unwillingly. 
  With long experience Piyadasa was no doubt a careful man. During the 80s in 
  particular, a number of individuals, Sinhalese, Tamil and Muslim, were killed 
  on the slenderest accusation of giving information. In the present climate of 
  a large number of people giving information, even an innocent conversation by 
  Piyadasa with soldiers who had moved into that area would have been given an 
  adverse interpretation. For example, in the case of the killing of two key LTTE 
  leaders in Thavady which is close to Innuvil, 1 1/2 months later, the army had 
  been able to obtain accurate information without the help of any Sinhalese around.</p>
<p>Kokkuvil, Manjavannapathy: 6th January :A man about 50 years old was found 
  shot dead. The local talk was that he had been `punished' by the LTTE</p>
<p>17th January: Uthayakumar , a merchant, was shot dead by the LTTE who claimed 
  responsibility saying that he was an informer.</p>
<p>Point Pedro: 18th January: Krishnakumar(48) of Valvettithurai was attached 
  to the security division of the Point Pedro CTB Depot and was a widower. His 
  deceased wife Indra had been the daughter of Mr.Kandasamy, Emeritus Principal 
  of Palaly Teachers' Training College. He lived alone with his mother and was 
  fond of dogs, of whom he kept several. As has often been found characteristic 
  of several critics of the LTTE of Valvettithurai origin (same as the Leader), 
  he was very frank and open about his criticism of the LTTE. This had obviously 
  been reported to the LTTE a long time ago. The fact that he was an outsider 
  and the fear of associating with someone openly critical of the LTTE, rendered 
  Krishnakumar somewhat isolated.</p>
<p>While the LTTE controlled Jaffna peninsula, it had used its middle class supporters 
  to spy and inform on others of similar social status. For example, a retired 
  gentleman in Point Pedro used to be visited after dark by two men from the LTTE 
  Intelligence Unit riding a motorcycle. He was periodically given instructions 
  to spy on particular persons. During 1993 this gentleman told some of his close 
  associates that the LTTE would soon place Krishnakumar under detention. But 
  this had not happened. Nothing happened until recently</p>
<p>On the day concerned an army patrol passed his house in V.M. Road near Vada-Hindu 
  Girls' School and the dogs barked. It was 6.50 p.m.(old time) and almost dark. 
  A little later the dogs barked again. Krishnakumar went out to look and five 
  shots were heard. His mother then came out and found him dead. Though it was 
  curfew time the mother carried a lantern and walked 1 1/2 miles to Manthikai 
  hospital to obtain help. The army came at 3:00 a.m. the next morning and took 
  away the body in an ambulance. The body was brought to the house after the inquest. 
  The event sent shock waves of terror among the people of Point Pedro. Hardly 
  anyone attended the funeral besides Krishnakumar's brother Jeyakumar and his 
  wife - the only ones to stand by the mother. Krishnakumar had no children. </p>
<p>It was later reportedly claimed by the LTTE that Krishnakumar had worked for 
  the Army Intelligence Unit. This is strenuously denied by all those who knew 
  him well. Such an occupation is not undertaken by those who are openly critical 
  of the LTTE. This is one of those periodic actions by the LTTE to keep the people 
  reminded that they would come back &quot;to wipe away their tears&quot;.</p>
<p>Point Pedro: 25th January: S.T.R.Jeyakumar was killed by the LTTE in exactly 
  the same manner on a Saturday at the same time, exactly a week after Krishnakumar 
  was killed. Jeyakumar was a photographer in Point Pedro with two children and 
  had gone to live in Vavuniya during the war. Following the army taking over 
  Vadamaratchy in April 1996, Jeyakumar brought his family back to Point Pedro 
  and resumed his trade of taking videos and photographs at functions. On the 
  day concerned someone came to his house, called him out and said that he had 
  come to collect some photographs. When Jeyakumar did not recognise the man, 
  the caller asked him to look at his face and then opened fire. The Uthayan report 
  indicated a claim that he had been an informant to the Army. There was also 
  local gossip to the effect that he had links with other militant groups who 
  had just begun setting up offices in Jaffna. All this was mere speculation. 
  Again those who knew him well averred that he had no links with the security 
  forces. Jeyakumar's funeral was well attended as he was a man of the area and 
  his children counted many playmates. Those in the locality are unaware of any 
  LTTE claim.</p>
<p>Polikandy (Vadamaratchy):30th January 1997: S.Shanmugam was executed by the 
  LTTE. He is said to have been fluent in Sinhalese. There have been several other 
  reports of killings by the LTTE of which we do not have the details. The Uthayan 
  of 25/12/96 quoted an Army spokesman as saying that the LTTE killed a 65 year 
  old woman in Point Pedro.</p>
<p>Manipay:6th February 1997: Y.Srinivasan(48) was killed by the LTTE. The charges 
  against him in a notice beside the body were reported in the Uthayan. He is 
  said to have betrayed supporters of the LTTE and provided information to the 
  army about an LTTE camp and hidden equipment. He is also said to have betrayed 
  a planned ambush in Sitthankerny resulting in the army recovering a claymore 
  mine. The LTTE further asked others who had fallen for &quot;charmed words and 
  privileges&quot; to give up such activities.</p>
<p>Nunavil:8th April 1997: Chelliah Padaiveerasingham was called out from his 
  house near the junction at 7.30 p.m. by someone standing at the gate. A shot 
  was heard a little later. His body was found the next morning a short distance 
  away. There was a board saying that he had been punished. The EPDP said (Uthayan 
  10/4/97) that he had been killed by the LTTE. Other sources in the area said 
  that Padaiveerasingham lived in a neighbourhood from which a number of persons 
  had joined the EPRLF, but that he was an innocent man having no contact with 
  the army. This contention is further strengthened by the fact that this killing 
  had left many people in the area puzzled. There was no local knowledge or rumour 
  to suggest that he had any links with either the Army or the LTTE. People simply 
  reasoned that the LTTE did not appear to have been responsible because it issues 
  a warning or two before killing someone. But we have a number of cases of LTTE 
  killings on record where no warning was given, and the LTTE denied responsibility. 
  Some people in the area drew the conclusion that the killing had been done by 
  Tamil groups who had recently come to Jaffna. The modus operandi however is 
  the one used by the LTTE and there are no indications that the other Tamil groups 
  who had been in Jaffna now for four months have indulged in such activities. 
  Yet some of the recent killings by the LTTE may have to do with driving fear 
  into persons who may have family or other connections with the Tamil parties 
  now in Jaffna. <br>
  <br>
  Imayaman Kovilady, Vadamaratchy : Mid May : Tharmalingam Saimini, a young woman 
  of 22 years, was shot dead by the LTTE. Her `crime' was that she was engaged 
  to a member of the Sri Lankan army. It is said that the LTTE had issued 3 warnings. 
  The funeral arrangements were undertaken by the Army.</p>
<p>Sarasalai, Thenmaratchy : 23rd May : Arumauam Kumarasooriyar ( 42), a trader, 
  also known as Suresh, was taken from his home by the LTTE during the night. 
  His dead body as discovered near Kamalasini School, Mattuvil, the following 
  morning. The charge against him is reportedly that he had retailed goods that 
  were shipped into Jaffna and supplied by the Army. Some sections of the army 
  are involved in trade on the side , even running some well-patronised canteens.<a href="#a">

<h3><a name="_Toc516743983">5: Civilians affected directly by LTTE attacks:</a></h3>
<p>Chavkacheri, Chankatthanai:19th January: LTTE cadre threw a grenade at soldiers 
  manning a temporary road - block and ran away. A school boy, Paramanathan Parthipan 
  (15) and some other civilians suffered injuries. </p>
<p>Ponnalai : 29th January : See 3 above and last section of Addendum on JTH.</p>
<p>Chankanai East : 19th February: According to a statement by the Army reported 
  in the 'Uthayan' and not contradicted, a claymore mine exploded in Chankanai 
  East at 7.30 AM on 19th February 1997, and a grenade was thrown, resulting in 
  5 civilians being injured and a 10 years old girl who was badly hurt being taken 
  to Palaly base for treatment.</p>
<p>Thalayady, Maruthankerni: 15th March: Passenger bus no 62-4774 plying route 
  No 807 at 6.15 a.m. was blasted by an LTTE land-mine. It is speculated that 
  those exploding the mine had thought that the bus was carrying soldiers. But 
  only regular passengers were in the bus. A woman, Pathmavathy(30), of Maruthankerny 
  and a man, Kandiah ( 65) of Udutthurai, were killed. 11 others were injured.</p>
<p>Thinnevely : mid-April : LTTE cadre threw grenades at soldiers between the 
  University of Jaffna and the post office. Those injured were 3 women and a man 
  who were 2nd year commerce students of the University :- P.Jeyarani (24), S.Priya 
  (23), N. Pushparani (25) &amp; C.Easan (23).</p>
<p>Illavalai, Valikamam North: 3rd June: An Army escorted bus was subject to a 
  land mine attack, killing a policeman, two soldiers and two civilians. The injured 
  civilians were taken to JTH.</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc516743984">6:A Note on Military Operations</a></h3>
<p>Despite a disturbing trend, reprisals remain the exception rather than the 
  rule. In Vadamaratchy discipline remains good. As an example, Irumpumathavady 
  in Navindil is an area frequented by the LTTE. Recently soldiers acting on information 
  ambushed and killed two or three LTTE cadre. About a week later the LTTE shot 
  and killed two soldiers on a motorcycle near the local army camp. Within an 
  hour the situation was normal and people were going past the army camp without 
  fear.</p>
<p>LTTE attacks on the Army mainly rely on hand grenades and claymore mines and 
  are thus principally aimed at un-nerving and provoking reprisals. The LTTE operates 
  in larger numbers in the south-eastern sector of Thenmaratchy where direct confrontations 
  sometimes take place. The LTTE admitted losing 4 men in a confrontation at Vettilaikerni 
  in early May. About 2.30 A.M. on 4th May the LTTE attacked the Army camp at 
  Thanankilappu and withdraw after half an hour leaving two dead. The Army too 
  seems to have suffered casualties as suggested by a report in the 'Uthayan', 
  that two helicopter landings in the army camp were sighted. 13 soldiers were 
  killed in an LTTE attack in Vettilaikerni just before independence day (4th 
  February). On 17th April 10 soldiers and two civilians travelling with them 
  were killed in a mine blast in Vadamaratchy East (uncleared). Their vehicle 
  was one in a convoy going on a mission. Following a round up using masked informants, 
  three persons from the same family in Nagar Kovil {Ariaratnam Selvakumar (23), 
  Ariaratnam Arulmathy (21), &amp; Periyathamby Amalanathan (31)} were taken away.</p>
<p>On the 6th December 1996, 6 soldiers having their usual bath at a well 75 yards 
  from the Meesalai camp in Thenmaratchy were killed when two claymore mines operated 
  by a pressure switch exploded. Overall, troop casualties appear to have declined 
  in comparison with last year, and the levels are far below the high casualty 
  rate in the East. The distinction between cleared and uncleared areas remains. 
  Often Special Forces mounted on motorcycles operate in uncleared areas. </p>
<p>Reports of LTTE casualties could be gleaned from the 'Uthayan'. These are often 
  coded ambiguously as 'bodies of unidentified youth'. One often reads that the 
  Police from Chavakacheri (in case of Thenmaratchy) or Chunnakam (in the case 
  of Valikamam) brought the bodies of unidentified youth to Jaffna Hospital for 
  identification and post-mortem examination. This usually means that no relative 
  had so far come forward to make an identification.</p>
<p>For example, the 'Uthayan' of 18-02-97 reported that the Chavakacheri Police 
  brought 8 bodies to Jaffna Hospital over the past 3 days, 5 from 3 separate 
  incidents. 3 unidentified bodies from an incident in Palai on the dawn of 15/2 
  were brought to Jaffna Hospital on the 17th evening. All three had gunshot injuries, 
  one had the chest and two hands smashed. The bodies of Nadaraja Prabakaran(21) 
  and Yogeswarasarma(22) killed on Sunday (16th) during the shooting incidents 
  in Mattuvil - Point Pedro Road and Navatkadu, Varani, respectively, were brought 
  to Jaffna Hospital in the evening, the same day. Their names were given by the 
  Police, but where they are from is not known.&quot;</p>
<p>There is, taking into account the circumstances given and not given, little 
  cause for doubt in the case of the first three. In the case of the last two 
  they may have possessed some form identification or may have been known in the 
  area. But for more than 24 hours, no one had come forward to claim the bodies. 
  Based on this, the element of doubt is however greater. We have given a case 
  above (24/2) where in the case of an innocent civilian killed, the family had 
  come to Jaffna Hospital for the body, but the Police refused saying that he 
  was LTTE.</p>
<p>Other typical reports are : (Uthayan 19/1/97): The body of a youth with gun 
  shot injuries was seen on Eluthumattuval - Nagarcovil road in the morning, the 
  day before yesterday. No further details were received of this corpse clad in 
  black trousers and a green banian.</p>
<p>(Same issue of Uthayan) :The corpse of a youth about 20 years, said to have 
  been shot dead in Chankanai, 9:50 a.m., day before yesterday, was brought by 
  the Chunnakam Police the same day. There were gunshot injuries in the left side 
  of the chest and in the neck. His name was given as Jegan. (Uthayan 27/2): The 
  body of a youth said to have been killed in the incident in Kokkuvil West day-before-yesterday, 
  was brought to Jaffna Hospital yesterday by the Chunnakam Police. It was made 
  known that the deceased was a member of the LTTE.</p>
<p>(The latter incident appears to have been in the context of the operation in 
  which two key members of the LTTE were killed the previous day in the same area 
  - report above)</p>
<p>(Uthayan 30/3): The body of an unidentified youth, about 29 years of age, said 
  to have been killed in the shooting incident at about 4:30p.m. in the Kondavil 
  area day before yesterday, was brought to Jaffna Hospital by the Jaffna Police 
  yesterday for identification and inquest proceedings. The corpse had gunshot 
  injuries in the back of the left shoulder and the upper right hand.</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc515699714"></a><a name="_Toc516743985">7 :Vadamaratchy</a></h3>
<p>We once more highlight Vadamaratchy as an area where the conduct of the army 
  has been exemplary. Missing persons have been very few and we know of only one 
  case in Irumbumathavady where arrest is being denied, which remains to be clarified. 
  Sadly much of this owes to the initiative of Colonel Larry Wijeratne, the brigade 
  commander, rather than to the army as an institution. In dealing with the people 
  he tries to understand them and remove causes for offence. On the vexed question 
  of persons having to dismount at check points and walk past soldiers he has 
  now made it the routine that people need not dismount from their vehicles. In 
  cases of persons who were victims of army action he has visited their homes 
  and tried to reassure their families. In the case of Muralitharan (Bulletin 
  No.13) who died under torture by the army, the Colonel visited the home, carried 
  the baby and made his personal apologies to the wife. In places where soldiers 
  had tended to misbehave, in order not to expose the complainants he had visited 
  homes in the area, which served as a warning to the soldiers. As a result he 
  has also been successful in forming a number of societies and even those of 
  youth, where issues could be discussed. </p>
<p>One of the successes was to arrange for 92 students (two from every GS division) 
  to visit the South where they were given opportunities to meet those of their 
  age in the South and also visit places of interest. This went ahead despite 
  warning letters to the headmen (GSs) from the LTTE. Applications for travel 
  to Colombo need to go through the brigade HQ and in following the normal routine 
  there is a long wait. Owing to the shortage of teachers the Colonel had politely 
  told teachers who gave him their applications to travel to Colombo, that rather 
  than wait their turn in the queue, if they would go during the vacation he would 
  see to it that they would travel as soon as their school broke and could then 
  return in time for the reopening. </p>
<p>In principle every civilian has access to the brigade commander. Normally the 
  civilians would first go to the civil affairs officer and if he could not help 
  them in the way they wanted, they could see the brigade commander if they were 
  prepared to wait. More recently the Colonel has been visiting places and homes 
  informally in civilian dress.</p>
<p>Recently the Colonel had been invited as the guest of honour at the prize givings 
  at Hartley College and Methodist Girls' School, Pt. Pedro. His speeches were 
  much appreciated. The Manila based Radio Veritas claimed in its Tamil broadcast 
  that the Colonel has been forcing himself on schools and has also forced schools 
  to fly the national (Sri Lankan) flag at their functions. Both these charges 
  are denied locally. The invitations were spontaneous. The Colonel had in fact 
  told the school principals that they are not under any compulsion to fly the 
  national flag.</p>
<p>It is also the first time after 1978 (at St.Patrick's) where a Sinhalese had 
  been so honoured at a prize -giving in Jaffna. The people are mainly looking 
  for decency and humanity. We are also given a strong hint of the wasteful and 
  destructive nature of government and military policy over the past decades, 
  as opposed to what could have been achieved by an appeal to reason and humanity.

  and Democratic Accountability</a></h3>
<h3><a name="_Toc515699716"></a><a name="_Toc516743987">8.1 The People</a></h3>
<p>Experience, that has been long and tragic, ought to have taught us that it 
  is the willingness of people at all levels of society to stand up and speak 
  their minds fearlessly that would ensure its health and well-being.</p>
<p>It is heartening to note that Jaffna is doing better than what might have been 
  expected in the light of what happened during the past 11 years. The Roman Catholic 
  Church has been the largest organised body in Jaffna, but it had almost totally 
  failed to take up a moral position during the long years of internecine strife 
  and internal oppression when blood flowed freely. The opportunism and culpability 
  of some clergy is also well-known. In recent times however it is a most encouraging 
  sign that Bishop Thomas Saundaranayagam is rising up to the occasion and saying 
  things that need to be said by a leader of his standing. In a number of interviews 
  he has given the press and visiting delegations, his remarks have been wide-ranging. 
  He has criticised the Government over its shortcomings and the needless disabilities 
  suffered by the people. But he has also done the difficult things like giving 
  credit to the Government and the Army where credit is due. He has also been 
  self-critical. Commenting on the lack of democratic initiative within the Tamil 
  community, he has said, &quot;For seven years we have been silent. We need once 
  more to teach ourselves how to speak&quot;. Tamil readers in Jaffna have however 
  not been given the benefit of what he has been saying. The Tamil press has generally 
  avoided publishing remarks which challenge the nationalist position. </p>
<p>There have also been letters to the editor of the Uthayan protesting against 
  arbitrary arrest and corruption. What follows is an excerpt from a letter to 
  the editor of the Athena (6th January 1997). It is a carefully drafted letter, 
  a good deal of which is double edged, and is capped by the irony of the editor's 
  note: &quot;...It has been pointed out in the press that the people returned 
  to Valikamam placing their faith in the armed forces. Arrests and disappearances 
  resulting from the activities of the armed forces have created a situation where 
  the gap between them and the people could only increase. I trust that my writing 
  this will not be taken as an action against the forces resulting in harm being 
  done to me. Yet it is being widely talked about that we came trusting the armed 
  forces and that we have been taken for a ride. Therefore I trust and plead that 
  the armed forces would treat this as a problem of those who placed their trust 
  on them and will take remedial action accordingly. <br>
  &quot;Even in recent times many persons have been arrested by both the Tigers 
  and the armed forces. But no information about these arrests is published in 
  the press. This has caused many readers of the Uthayan (the only paper in Jaffna) 
  to wonder if it is being subject to censorship through clandestine means...&quot; 
</p>
<p>Editor's note: &quot;In consideration of the safety of this reader from Anaikkottai, 
  we have decided to withhold his name.&quot; </p>
<h3><a name="_Toc515699717"></a><a name="_Toc516743988">8.2 Tamil Political Parties 
  in Jaffna</a> </h3>
<p>From January four former militant groups, the EPDP, EPRLF, TELO &amp; PLOTE 
  are represented in Jaffna as political parties. The EPRLF had largely ceased 
  to function as a militant group since 1990. There had been misgivings about 
  their deployment in Jaffna owing to a negative view of the activities of some 
  groups that had worked closely with the armed forces. For example, in our recent 
  report on the Vanni, we highlighted some of the activities of the PLOTE and 
  TELO in Vavuniya. Manikkathasan, who is the deputy leader of the PLOTE, has 
  been personally associated with a number of uninvestigated killings even under 
  the present government. Under the terms in which these groups were to set up 
  office in Jaffna, they could maintain rifles in their offices and certain leaders 
  were allowed to carry pistols for their protection while moving around. So far 
  the earlier fears have not materialised and these groups are so far known to 
  be playing only a political role in the peninsula proper (i.e. excluding the 
  Islands where the EPDP had long maintained an armed presence). </p>
<p>Up to this time there have been no major complaints although doubts remain. 
  At least people who need help with someone arrested, want to go to Colombo urgently, 
  wish to make a telephone call to Colombo, wish to find a job or talk about some 
  other problem, feel that they could approach someone who might do something. 
  These groups have also been exerting pressure regarding missing persons and 
  have been pressing for inquiries in the case of persons killed by army action. 
</p>
<p>There would always be the nagging fear that some elements from these groups 
  who are very much beholden to individual army officers rather than to anyone 
  else, may, if things become difficult, be used in the manner in which they have 
  been used in Vavuniya and the Eastern Province. The LTTE no doubt hopes that 
  such an eventuality would arise. If such pitfalls are avoided, this may be an 
  opportunity for these groups to redeem themselves. The TULF has been criticised 
  for not coming to Jaffna and according to a TULF spokesman, they are seriously 
  thinking of moving in. </p>
<h3><a name="_Toc516743989">9. Hobson's choice facing disillusioned combatants</a></h3>
<p>On both sides many of the combatants see themselves caught up in a war that 
  has lost all meaning for them. But all choices seem unenviable. In recent weeks 
  there have been well publicised desertions of security personnel sent to the 
  Vanni from safer postings. A batch of applicants who went recently to be interviewed 
  for selection as army officers were surprised to find themselves strongly discouraged 
  by serving officers who met them on the way. In the case of the Tamil struggle 
  the causes of disillusionment are very deep and have been increasingly felt 
  from its militarisation in the 80s. We have discussed this in earlier reports 
  and the issue has been covered from several perspectives in the 'Broken Palmyra'. 
  We merely point to some recent developments.</p>
<p>With the opening of the Vavuniya-Mannar road earlier this year the army stopped 
  the boat service from Vidathaltivu in the LTTE controlled mainland to Mannar 
  Island that had been under army control. The pass system operated by the LTTE 
  had made it very difficult for its deserters and ex-militiamen to leave its 
  domain. The army wanted travellers to Mannar Island to come to Uyilankulam on 
  the newly opened main road and take a bus. The people did this despite being 
  forbidden by the LTTE and in time it became regularised. With many pressing 
  matters on its hands the LTTE lost control of the situation. Consequently, it 
  became an escape route for LTTE deserters who went to Uyilankulam and surrendered 
  to the army.</p>
<p>On 1st May 1997, about 4 LTTE men went along with the civilians with concealed 
  weapons and suddenly opened fire at soldiers manning the Uyilankulam entry point. 
  Two soldiers were hit of one whom died later. The soldiers had been without 
  success trying to get the civilians into two queues. Fortunately there was present 
  a competent civil co-ordinator, Wijedasa, a retired army officer who was trilingual, 
  who got the people to lie down before the army responded with small weapons 
  and cannon. The shells fell further afield killing the son of Bar Ponniah of 
  Mannar, father of a four months child. One shell killed two cows, and a lady 
  about to feed them stood transfixed by shock holding the bag of feed, when a 
  piece of shrapnel from a second shell, tore through the bag though not harming 
  her. Subsequently LTTE deserters who came to surrender were beaten and the message 
  has been given that the army does not want LTTE deserters to come that way. 
  The people of the area live on pins owing to occassional shelling.</p>
<p>Once the LTTE's deputy leader Mahattaya was placed under custody in 1993, those 
  who were closely associated with him became suspect and were tortured by their 
  own organisation. According to local figures in Chavakachcheri, when the Army 
  moved in there in April 1996 they used Mahattaya loyalists who had come over 
  to them to screen out LTTE cadre who had remained in refugee camps. The mother 
  of a detainee from Meesalai said that her own son was being tortured by former 
  LTTE men now working for the army. A number of former LTTE men now dressed in 
  Sri Lankan army uniform have been observed in Jaffna. In the Manipay area a 
  former LTTE area leader is now said to hold the rank of 'captain' in the army. 
  The LTTE cadre Sayanthan (alias Anandan) who was responsible for the landmine 
  attack at Ponnalai on 29th January (report above) was arrested in Araly after 
  being shot in the leg. He told a fellow prisoner apologetically that he did 
  not have time to take the cyanide. The army is known to have been treating him 
  well. </p>
<p>Thus one gets accounts of many strange things in Jaffna. A young man who came 
  from Colombo and attended a funeral in his village, was closely questioned by 
  a former acquaintance. Others at the funeral warned him, &quot;Be careful of 
  what you tell him, he is very close to the LTTE&quot;. The next day this young 
  man was going past an army camp when to his surprise he observed the same person 
  who questioned him holding hands with a soldier, engaged in a very friendly 
  conversation. A young man Ramesh who lived near Valvettithurai was shot dead 
  by the LTTE. The local talk is that LTTE cadre had visited his home, had dinner 
  with him and he had gone along with them to escort them safely out. But subsequently 
  they had shot him. <br>
  What follows is the story of a young man caught up in a tragedy that is very 
  characteristic of the atmosphere. After the forced exodus of the civilian population 
  from Valikamam in 0ctober 1995, Haran deserted from the LTTE and stayed with 
  his family which included two sisters, who were refugees in Thenmaratchy. One 
  day the LTTE came to the area and said that they were looking for two LTTE deserters 
  who were being hidden by the refugees. But on that particular day Haran had 
  gone to another village for the night. After the Army moved in those who were 
  members of the LTTE were asked to surrender. The parents arranged for Haran 
  to be surrendered by a person of standing.</p>
<p>Haran was kept for a few days and released with a slip of paper. With this 
  he enjoyed the freedom to travel much more freely than was permitted to normal 
  civilians. He was freely allowed to go into the uncleared areas and come back. 
  At one point he visited the Thavady area frequently and had evidently made contact 
  with the LTTE. Having had lunch one day in September 1996 with some LTTE members 
  who had come from the Vanni, he was shot dead by the army near Uduvil where 
  he is said to have been attempting to throw a grenade. One explanation of this 
  episode is that he had been an agent deliberately left behind by the LTTE. But 
  what seems to fit the facts better is that he had agreed to provide information 
  to the Army and had at the same time tried to persuade his LTTE companions that 
  he was on their side. He may have been sent to throw a grenade to prove his 
  loyalty to the LTTE.</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc515699718"></a><a name="_Toc516743990">10. A follow up on earlier 
  reports and issues</a> </h3>
<p>Kerudavil:4th August 1996:In Special Report No.7 of August last year we reported 
  the murder of Karthigesan and his daughter Baleswari, the latter being killed 
  after rape. According to local sources the culprits were detained by the Army 
  following medical evidence. We have no record of what further action was taken.</p>
<p>Meesalai:8th August 1996:Navaratnakurukkal Koneswara (27), Brahmin priest, 
  had gone to Meesalai the previous day and set off home to Point Pedro via Jaffna 
  about 9.30 a.m. He did not reach home. All possible agencies were informed including 
  army camps but to no avail.</p>
<p>Chavakacheri: 12th August 1996: Chinniah Somaskandan, Arts student, University 
  of Jaffna, originally from Thellipalai, refugee in Chavakacheri, arrested on 
  the way to the university via Kopay. Mother, Rajapoopathy Somaskandan, widow, 
  has since then been inquiring at army camps only to be sent from one camp to 
  the other.</p>
<p>Karambakkurichchi, Varani:13th August 1996:<br>
  V.Ramanathan(25) unmarried was killed in 'cross fire'.</p>
<p>Manduvil, Thenmaratchi:28th August 1996:The decayed body of M.Kanagu(55) with 
  the hands tied was found in the cesspit of a lavatory close to his house. The 
  detection was made a month after the victim had gone to see his lands and not 
  returned. The identification was made by the wife. The culprits were not traced. 
  In our Special Report No.7 of August 1996, we reported a similar case from the 
  same area during the same month. In that case the victim, Mayuran (19) who was 
  thrust into a cesspit had managed to attract the attention of a lady with sharp 
  ears and was rescued. It was also in this area that on 17th May 1996 three males 
  and a child were chopped to death and three women were raped. This too remains 
  uninvestigated.</p>
<p>Sarasalai, Thenmarathci:13th September 1996:At about 6 p.m. Saravanabavanandan(21) 
  was made to crawl by soldiers and was shot from behind. The army version is 
  that he had come with arms with 15 others.</p>
<p>Nunavil, Thenmaratchy: 18th September 1996: Thangavelu Rajendraumar(28) of 
  Atthai, Alvai East, Vadamaratchy, was Sarvodhaya Regional Co-ordinator, Vadamaratchy. 
  On the day in question he went to the regional office at Nunavil at 10 a.m. 
  and was arrested by the army in the vicinity, at the site of a claymore mine 
  incident the previous day. The arrest was witnessed by a watcher who is prepared 
  to testify anywhere. Rajendrakumar is frail and suffers from occassional fits.</p>
<p>Thenguthattu, Thenmaratchi:22nd September 1996:This village is 300 yards beyond 
  the bund. 6 persons were killed by shells fired from Eluthumattuval South.<br>
  Manduvil, Thenmaratchi:24th September 1996:Krishnapillai(57) was killed by the 
  LTTE in the presence of his daughter. He was reportedly accused of being friendly 
  with the army.</p>
<p>We have so far been unable to find local confirmation of the claim made in 
  the LTTE Bulletin of 15th August 1996, that the bodies of three young girls 
  and five young men were discovered in a shallow grave which was connected apparently 
  with an army round up in Kachchai and Thanankilappu. The people contacted were 
  not aware of this particular incident but there was a rumour about the disappearance 
  of 13 persons in another part of Thenmaratchi of which we have no concrete testimony. 
  (The recent AI report gives an incident in mid-1996 in Thenmaratchy West, where 
  a number of persons went missing.) </p>
<p>In Bulletin No.13 of 27th December 1996 we reported the arrest by the army 
  of Sivagurunathan Arutchelvam(20) in Kaputhoo, Vadamaratchi. We are informed 
  that he has been released. We also reported the arrest in Thanankilappu of Sathasivam 
  Ramesh(19) on 15th October 1996, who had crossed the lagoon with his mother. 
  We are now informed that he was held at the Chavakachcheri army camp and transferred 
  to KKS on 23rd December 1996. He wrote his first letter to his mother on 26/12/96. 
  He was subsequently transferred to Magazine Prison, Colombo and his case was 
  to be heard in Anuradhapura on 9th May. When his mother had inquired at the 
  Chavakachcheri camp just after his arrest, she had been firmly told that her 
  son was not there. The case of Poopathy Aravindan (26) missing after arrest 
  in July`96 (Our Bulletin No.13)was taken up before the MoD's committee in Jaffna 
  on 17th April.</p>
<p>The case of the Chundikuli tie:12th December 1996: The LTTE London Bulletin 
  of this date stated that the bodies of a number of Tamil school children were 
  washed ashore around Mullaithivu. One corpse of a girl in school uniform is 
  said to have been wearing a tie of Chundikuli Girls' College, Jaffna. The Uthayan 
  published a news item on 13/12/96 quoting news agencies in London that the bodies 
  of 3 girls previously subject to abuse were washed ashore in Mullaitivu. It 
  added that this had been confirmed by the BBC Sinhalese Service. Its issue of 
  19/12/96 gave further information quoting a letter from the TULF leader to the 
  President that the corpse had both the Chundikuli tie and school badge. The 
  issue of 25/12/96 carried a response from the army. The army had interviewed 
  the school principal who had said that other than the case of the rape victim 
  Chryshanthy Coomarasamy (who was killed on 7/9/96) she had received no reports 
  from parents or relatives about any other girl missing and that in such an event 
  she ought to be the first to be informed. She too had heard about the Mullaithivu 
  corpse from the press. The Uthayan was faulted for blindly publishing reports 
  coming from Colombo and abroad without going to the trouble of checking with 
  the school principal who was accessible within the same Jaffna municipal limits. 
  The truth about the corpses remains a mystery. </p>
<h3><a name="_Toc515699719"></a><a name="_Toc516743991">11:What is the reality 
  behind missing persons?</a></h3>
<p>Of the 676 missing persons listed by Amnesty International, 576 are from Thenmaratchi 
  and 100 from Valikamam. The committee appointed by the Defence Ministry to look 
  into missing persons heard 59 cases in January(Jaffna Municipality 19, rest 
  of Valikamam 12, Thenmaratchy 28) and another 60 cases in April(Jaffna Municipality 
  13, rest of Valikamam 27, Thenmaratchi 20). No findings have been made public 
  so far. Of the number given by Amnesty, 361 went missing in August 1996. We 
  may take AI's to be the most complete list. </p>
<p>We had ourselves suggested that one reason why the government was so silent 
  on the matter is that a number of those detained had died under conditions of 
  torture or criminal assault. The case of the remains in the cesspit given in 
  the earlier section is almost certainly one of several such examples that may 
  never come to light. What independent information do we have with regard to 
  this question? According to testimony coming from two middle ranking army officers 
  (above the level of captain), the Army did eliminate scores of persons belonging 
  to the LTTE who were captured or picked up in Valikamam when the army moved 
  into Jaffna town in December 1995. They claimed that their bodies had been burnt. 
  But they added that of those detained after April 1996 when the civilians returned 
  to Valikamam, no one was eliminated and that they are nearly all under custody. 
</p>
<p>As to the first claim we have no independent sources, but it does conform to 
  the little that is known about what happened after the Army came to Jaffna in 
  December 1995. We recorded the case of a merchant in Kandarmadam in whose house 
  at that time 20 LTTE cadre had taken shelter. When the army came there on a 
  tip off, the merchant himself was shot along with three LTTE cadre. As far as 
  the LTTE is concerned all those left behind in Valikamam who fell into the Army's 
  hands should have taken cyanide rather than get captured. Even after April 1996, 
  summary executions do not seem to have been regarded unusual - e.g. the execution 
  of two captured cadre in Navindil (Sp. Rep. No.7). If the claim about eliminations 
  is true, it is made the more baneful when one also considers that there is an 
  association of families of missing servicemen in the South with the late General 
  Kobbekkaduwa's widow as patron. These families have been frantically seeking 
  information of about 500 missing servicemen. Public appeals to the LTTE through 
  the press by some of the parents have been both moving and conciliatory, with 
  emphasis on a strong desire for peace. </p>
<p>In the case of testimonies we have recorded in the previous reports, the methods 
  of torture were so unrestrained that several of those detained would have died. 
  Despite repeated protests, the Government was in practice very lackadaisical 
  about the matter. This partly owes to the sheer inertia of the system.</p>
<p>We do have testimony that torture in the form of suffocation with petrol bags 
  and severe assault with thick pieces of wood went on at least until the end 
  of last year. A prisoner who was at Chavakachcheri camp testified that when 
  he was beaten on the hands the piece of wood came down on his handcuffs causing 
  them to break. Several persons so treated are likely to be released by the Anuradhapura 
  High Court after a nominal bail of Rs 1500/= - meaning that they are practically 
  innocent. Most of the torture seems to have been carried out at local camps 
  rather than at Palaly base itself. At Palaly base there seems to be some form 
  of internal accounting where records are maintained of prisoners who are brought 
  there. If a prisoner does get sent to Palaly for medical treatment, he or she 
  would then come into this accounting process. An exception seems to be prisoners 
  taken by the Special Forces (SF). According to testimony coming from an army 
  nurse, prisoners sent for medical treatment by the Special Forces are returned 
  to the SF themselves. A particular case referred to was Shanthy from Brown Road, 
  Jaffna, a female LTTE cadre picked up by the SF in the uncleared part of Kokkuvil 
  early this year, who was tortured with her vagina being burnt with lighted cigarettes.</p>
<p>The Government seems to have settled down to dealing with the problem of missing 
  persons by releasing a small number of detainees at a time. There are regular 
  news items in the `Uthayan' providing information about youths detained or released. 
  The issue of 8/12/96 said that there were 149 youths at Kalutara from the North, 
  most of whom were arrested in 1996. It also said that 21 were being released. 
  On 16/2/97 the Uthayan published a list of 34 persons held at Magazine Prison 
  said to have been given by the EPDP. The Government might hope that by so releasing 
  small numbers at a time, the issue might in the end become so cloudy that it 
  will be very difficult to obtain an accurate picture as to how many were released 
  and how many had disappeared. The existing instruments, both national and international, 
  do not seem to afford a remedy against so called 'friendly' governments getting 
  away with such things. </p>
<p>Recently, a 'Committee for the Defence of Missing Persons' in Jaffna sent a 
  memorandum to the President of Sri Lanka which reads: &quot;&#8230;students, 
  government servants and employees of private institutions were among those detained 
  by the security forces. About 800 parents so affected have been blighted in 
  both body and mind. Life has lost its meaning and their life-span too has been 
  shortened&#8230;Despite warnings from other quarters it is out of the trust 
  reposed on you and the armed forces that we chose to live under government control&#8230;Our 
  children were arrested by the army before our own eyes at their check points. 
  They had neither gone abroad nor joined the LTTE [as is sometimes suggested 
  by officers]&#8230;Our minimum demand is that arrangements should be made for 
  them to exchange letters with us - their parents&#8230;&quot; </p>
<h3><a name="_Toc515699720"></a><a name="_Toc516743992">12. Jaffna: Condemned 
  by her own sons?</a></h3>
<p>It is unfortunately true that Jaffna has suffered the most from political game-playing 
  by her own sons who had cut off any permanent stake in the place. We have pointed 
  out before that the LTTE's activities were most profitable to those who wanted 
  to establish themselves abroad. During the war years while a relatively privileged 
  section with the means or foreign connections was seeking to establish themselves 
  abroad as immigrants or refugees, propaganda by persons from the same group 
  in concert with the LTTE sought to represent life in the North-East as having 
  become impossible entirely due to state oppression. We will not go into the 
  several ways in which this contention was used and abused. We just take one 
  strand.</p>
<p>The Medical Institute of Tamils (MIOT) was formed in 1994 and it convened its 
  first meeting in London in September 1994. Many distinguished Tamil doctors 
  attended who genuinely wanted to help the people. The medical problems of the 
  North-East highlighted were genuine and urgent, and no doubt the government 
  was culpable in a big way. One paper highlighted mental illness and trauma as 
  being about the gravest problem with internal repression under the LTTE being 
  among the major causes. (This was played down by censorship in the published 
  collection.) The purpose of the conference was to seek remedies. </p>
<p>As a follow up, a &quot;Short Visit Programme for Doctors&quot; was announced. 
  The appeal was published in the May/June 1995 Bulletin of the Tamil Information 
  Centre (London), a co-sponsor of the conference. The appeal mentioned &quot;large 
  numbers suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) resulting from 
  constant shelling and bombing by the Sri Lankan Security Forces&quot; (no doubt 
  true, but partially). It added: &quot;The overriding health need in the North-East, 
  however, according to the visiting and local doctors is personnel. The attitude 
  of the Sri Lankan government towards the North-East population is calculated 
  apathy and it is only the Tamil medical fraternity abroad that can fill the 
  prime need for medical personnel&quot;.</p>
<p>In announcing the details for volunteers, it was stated: &quot;Transportation 
  will be arranged from Colombo under the auspices of the Red Cross or other organisations. 
  Board and lodging will be provided during the stay in Eelam&quot; (our emphasis). 
</p>
<p>Clearly, as a programme requiring the co-operation of the ministries of health, 
  defence and the local Red Cross, it was a non-starter. An explanation is owed 
  about what the intentions were.</p>
<p>Came the Government offensive in Jaffna in October 1995, and the LTTE ordered 
  the civilians to leave Valikamam on 30th October. This had no doubt been planned 
  at least some weeks earlier. It was to be represented to the world that a patriotic 
  people left en masse of their own free will, because they did not recognise 
  nor wanted to live under an alien government. A privileged few had early notice 
  to leave with their possessions (our Special Report No. 6) The international 
  networks had to be primed to articulate this message and represent the enormous 
  sufferings of the dispossessed as being due to the Government alone, and promote 
  the LTTE as their saviour.</p>
<p>The medical problems of the residents of Jaffna today remain no less severe 
  than they were in 1994, and there are far fewer doctors. Most consultant specialists 
  in Jaffna hospital have left. There is to begin with, no permanent surgeon at 
  present. Many peripheral units are without doctors at all. The doctors in Nainathivu 
  and Vadamaratchi East have left. The people who are now more vulnerable to infectious 
  diseases could suddenly be faced with epidemics with totally inadequate medical 
  care. For example, during recent years malarial illness has been common in the 
  early months of the year. There is only one doctor in Kayts serving the islands, 
  and in February the Kayts hospital had at one time 40 patients warded. In Thenmaratchi 
  1271 fever victims had their blood tested at Chavakachcheri hospital. Point 
  Pedro hospital at Manthikai, once a thriving hospital has, besides the MSF staff, 
  only two qualified doctors, one of whom is in harness after passing his age 
  of retirement. Jaffna peninsula which was a relatively a healthy place for much 
  of this century, now according to medical sources, has a significantly higher 
  rate of infant mortality. </p>
<p>A particular group of vulnerable persons, whose numbers could rise to more 
  than 150,000 with the current military situation in the Vanni, is of a kind 
  that has been unknown during this century. These are mainly Vanni returnees 
  from the late 1995 exodus. They record a high incidence of septicaemia, malaria, 
  cerebral malaria, typhoid and the so-called 'fire fever'. The latter has been 
  known particularly among Jaffna's displaced population from about 1991. The 
  victims succumb within two days. These people have to carry the scars of the 
  'Exodus' that was primarily a game for those who articulated it.</p>
<p>Yet little has been heard about concern for the health needs of the people 
  from those who were vocal on the subject when the LTTE was in control. It would 
  appear as though their medical problems had ceased to exist along with the people 
  themselves. The romance in highlighting their problems has vanished. Jaffna 
  no longer has the glamour where expatriates could come in and carry back a coveted 
  video record of their having tea with LTTE functionaries. Jaffna is only fit 
  to be a free-fire zone. (See addendum on Jaffna hospital.)</p>
<p>Those who have tried to persuade Tamil doctors to come and work in Jaffna, 
  even from Colombo, have found the effort singularly unrewarding. The British 
  Foreign Minister who was in Jaffna last December had also made the observation 
  that efforts at trying to persuade Tamil doctors in Britain to spend a short 
  time in Jaffna while receiving all the benefits of working in Britain, turned 
  out to be futile. The propaganda is such that even those who may have considered 
  going to Jaffna are being discouraged by fellow Tamils. In Jaffna itself several 
  middle class areas are largely empty of inhabitants. There may be just one couple 
  who have the care of parents, grand parents, uncles, aunts and other elders 
  whose other descendants had left. One such young man who was himself being asked 
  to come abroad by his doctor brother, who told him that there is soon going 
  to be an attack to liberate Jaffna, observed sceptically: &quot;In earlier years 
  those who were leaving Jaffna were considered traitors in LTTE propaganda. Now 
  supported by LTTE propaganda those abroad consider themselves patriots, while 
  we who are trying to keep life going for ourselves and those around us are regarded 
  as traitors!&quot;</p>
<p><b><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:Arial'>13. The Search for Remedial 
  Measures</span></b><br>
  <br>
  We stated at the beginning that the issue of missing persons is a reflection 
  of much of what has happened. The numbers missing in each division is also a 
  measure of the gulf between the people and the authorities in the area. As for 
  external consequences, the Government may well get away by dragging its feet 
  and inviting foreign observers at some convenient time to report that the human 
  rights situation has improved in a technical sense. Yet it is widely recognised 
  that quantitative improvement is farcical unless it is matched by benign institutional 
  changes and the removal of repressive laws. Of these we have seen nothing. Even 
  the President's feeble attempts at reform could make only a limited and temporary 
  impact as they are not supported by criteria or processes for evaluation, matched 
  by a system of rewards and punishments to encourage certain tendencies and to 
  discourage others.</p>
<p>Thus pressure needs to be constantly applied to hold the Government accountable 
  in the fullest sense possible. Means must be developed to counter the Government's 
  evasiveness. Apart from individual tragedies, the failure to address the human 
  rights issue fully or to merely treat it as a public relations ritual, poisons 
  the political atmosphere to a point where the options left are unserviceable.</p>
<p>Given the situation described in this report, one could easily see how the 
  situation could deteriorate if the human rights question is not addressed urgently: 
  The gulf between the Army and the people will grow, the Army becoming more harsh 
  with the people in response to LTTE provocations that include more frequent 
  attacks on anyone perceived as an opponent. Terror takes over the community. 
  All those who had hitherto lacked the courage or conviction to take any stand 
  whatsoever, would take refuge behind slogans like &quot;It is wrong to criticise 
  the LTTE&quot; and &quot;You could never trust a Sinhalese government or a Sinhalese 
  army&quot;.</p>
<p>We have been here before and it is political terrain in which the LTTE feels 
  most at home, where it has so far found no match. Its job would become about 
  as easy as carrying out selective assassinations and keeping up provocations. 
  Then all those, who took bold initiatives, spoke up or tried something different 
  and constructive, would find themselves isolated, frustrated and even eliminated. 
</p>
<p>In such an impasse talks with the LTTE would be advanced as a lifeline, not 
  as being about democracy, peace or devolution, but as a truce - an elusive truce 
  between two oppressive agents, both having good deal to hide. There will be 
  nothing in it for the people. We have been here before too.</p>
<p>Variants of these very real dangers must be kept in mind while addressing what 
  needs to be done. To begin with, the Government should not be allowed to get 
  away with further excuses for not opening up Jaffna fully. If human rights organisations 
  and journalists have unhindered access, it would do a lot of good. Jaffna has 
  two options. It could improve dramatically or die the slow death it is undergoing 
  now. </p>
<p>To those who were prepared to ignore the hidden realities of the LTTE's regime, 
  what obtains in Jaffna today looks more repressive - freedom of movement has 
  been curtailed, arrest is less predictable and crime seems more conspicuous. 
  But many of those who have lived through the vicissitudes of the last two decades 
  refuse to see things so pessimistically. There is today more freedom, perhaps 
  just a little more, to speak one's mind openly, if one dares. With varying degrees 
  of clarity, many see the crucial importance of pushing this freedom to its limits. 
</p>
<p>It is futile to compare what occurred under the LTTE with what exits today. 
  That would be to apply static criteria instead of looking at what could be done. 
  When the Sri Lankan Army, which in the past had alienated the ordinary Tamil 
  by its actions and its virtual transformation as a Sinhalese Army, tries to 
  administrate without much political initiative, people resent its overriding 
  authority as well as its inefficient functioning. The LTTE regime, being part 
  of the community, having suppressed all forms of independent initiative by the 
  people, was able to provide the elementary services with much efficiency. But 
  the politics of the LTTE has a very dangerous flaw:- Its constant need to enhance 
  the very real insecurity faced by the Tamil people, tap their lower instincts 
  for hatred and revenge, and so use them to further brutalise the `enemy'. It 
  progressively suppresses any potential there is for peace building. The tragic 
  plight of the Vanni returnees from the engineered exodus of late 1995 is characteristic 
  of what it will bring again and again. This makes the freedom of thought and 
  expression far less abstract and equally more precious. </p>
<p>The people who flocked back to Jaffna in April 1996 saw some changes - an army 
  that was disciplined, and a government which showed at least a vision of finding 
  a political solution to the ethnic problem. This vision was allowed to become 
  skewed. The reader of this report, we hope, would have found food for thought 
  on what needs to done to redeem that vision.<a href="#a"> [Top]</a> </p>

name="_Toc516743994">Miscellany on Jaffna Teaching Hospital</a></h3>
<p>From 1986 when shells fired by the army from Jaffna Fort fell in and around 
  Jaffna Teaching Hospital(JTH), it has occupied a central place in the drama 
  surrounding the war. On the one hand the hospital was crucial to the morale 
  and well -being of the community, and on the other there was propaganda benefit 
  to be derived from incidents that pointed to the Government's ill-will or malignity 
  towards the hospital. With the politics having become serpentine and callous, 
  the issues concerning the vicissitudes of the hospital have never been clear-cut. 
  (See the Broken Palmyrah' and subsequent reports of the UTHR(J).) From its heyday 
  in the early 80's when the medical profession in Jaffna counted a number of 
  persons of international standing and the future promised great things, the 
  hospital is today faced with many uncertainties. The current position is briefly 
  reviewed below.</p>
<p><b><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Staff Position</span></b><br>
  Only the department of medicine that counts three specialists- Dr (Mrs) Ganeshamoorthy, 
  Dr (Mrs) Nagendra and Dr.Anandaraja - could be said to be stable. A few departments 
  having consultants/specialists, but where the position remains shaky are: Ophthalmology 
  (Dr.Kugasthasan,) ENT (Dr.Sivasubrarmaniam), Obstetrics (Dr. Karunakaran, supported 
  by the Resident Obstetrician, Dr.Gunaratnam) &amp; Pathology (Dr.(Miss) Sinnappah). 
  There is an anaesthetist (Dr (Mrs) Theivendran), but there had been no surgeon 
  since the return of refugees in April 1996 until the arrival of the MSF surgeon 
  on 1st April 1997.Some positions with no consultant/specialist are : Paediatrician, 
  Neurologist, Neuro - Surgeon, OPD (for the past six years) &amp; Surgeon.</p>
<p>The hospital is very short of junior level doctors, among whom are Senior House 
  Officers (SHOs). These persons are normally recruited a year after passing out 
  as doctors. But in Jaffna an SHO now means something much more. A number of 
  them have served six years in that position without going elsewhere to further 
  themselves in the profession as was normally the case. Many felt obliged to 
  delay their departure as there was no one to relieve them. Though lacking avenues 
  to attend conferences, seminars and in general discuss their work in broader 
  fora, the work during the war years was such that they had acquired valuable 
  experience and skills - sometimes even performing surgical operations.</p>
<p>Some of the staff positions as at present are : Medicine - 2 out of 4 SHO positions 
  filled; Obstetrics - 2 out of 3; Surgery- nil out of 3; Paediatrics - nil. Out 
  of 26 vacancies for interns, only 5 are filled. <br>
  Labourers - no apparent shortage after 70 were recruited recently by advertisement. 
  Nurses- short by 120 out of a total of about 300 positions. Despite the dire 
  shortage, 24 hours coverage is provided through voluntary arrangements among 
  doctors.</p>
<p>Some reasons for the shortage:<br>
  The isolation of Jaffna and the lack of senior persons from whom skills can 
  be acquired or guidance sought, has made JTH unattractive for the young wanting 
  to move ahead. The natural first step should therefore be to attract senior 
  persons, and to address the question why those fairly well settled in Jaffna 
  life have left. There are also reasons besides the more obvious ones related 
  to the war with no end in sight. Those remaining do so for a mixture of reasons- 
  eg. professional or moral dedication, a strong bond with the place and its people, 
  facing a rare challenge - and in sum, service and life in Jaffna offers them 
  a satisfaction they could not get elsewhere. </p>
<p>What recent events, particularly the `95 exodus had done, was to virtually 
  wipe off the modest capital several of them had for an emergency as land and 
  property, thus putting them under much pressure. It has been pointed out that 
  the money that is available to redress this shortage could perhaps be used far 
  more effectively. USAID spends an estimated Rs.6 lakhs (US$ 10 000) a month 
  to provide 3 MSF personnel who are much needed. If a similar sum from well-wishers 
  is used to provide incentives for a few years to local doctors who would work 
  in Jaffna, the results, it is averred, would be more effective and permanent. 
  The health ministry too, it is said, would do well to address an anomaly that 
  obliges returning senior expatriate doctors to work on contract at the lowest 
  point of the consultant's scale, with no allowances.<a href="#a"> [Top]</a></p>
<p><b><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Medical Supplies to Jaffna</span></b><br>
  Requests for supplies have to be endorsed by the Ministry of Health and then 
  processed by the Ministry of Defence. When Jaffna was under LTTE control, the 
  first was routine while the latter (MoD) made cuts in the list before passing 
  it. From April 1996 the MoD has made no cuts except for disallowing Ketamine, 
  an anaesthetic that could be used in the field. </p>
<p>All gifts to Jaffna Hospital need MoD approval, and this is now routinely granted. 
  NGOs (e.g. ICRC&amp;MSF) are now not allowed to take their own supplies of medicine 
  to Jaffna. The MSF for example has to get its medicines from JTH. Previously, 
  under LTTE control, the NGOs used to supplement what JTH received in short- 
  supply. A hospital spokesman said that the NGOs still had the option of donating 
  the medicines to JTH in Colombo, which would then be approved by the MoD, transported 
  to Jaffna and then be available from JTH.</p>
<p>Up to the end of last year, the JTH however had problems with supplies. The 
  Commissioner General of Essential Services, who is said to have been unsympathetic 
  and has since been replaced, had insisted that medical supplies to Jaffna should 
  go in normal cargo vessels and not in the ICRC ship that did weekly trips to 
  Jaffna. This had resulted in long delays (e.g. 25 days form Colombo to JTH) 
  and up to 30% loss by pilferage. Matters came to a crisis during Deepavali (November) 
  1996, when merchants used their influence to push the ship with medicines out 
  of KKS harbour and unload instead vessels with festive goodies and aerated waters. 
  The resulting shortage of medicines led to protests and the question of transport 
  by the ICRC was taken up again. The minister of health is regarded both sympathetic 
  and co-operative.<a href="#a"> [Top]</a></p>
<p><b><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Buildings and infrastructure</span></b><br>
  Sections of some buildings (e.g. surgical ward) were badly damaged. The three 
  storey maternity block that faces Victoria Road and the Army HQ (i.e.Subash 
  Hotel ) is not used since the Army has cited security reasons and forbidden 
  its use. This has been a sore point which the hospitals authorities have raised 
  with the Army again and again. The Army too has changed its mind several times 
  on the matter. Maternity patients now use the very inadequate ground floor of 
  an incomplete building with no proper labour room. Bed space is so short that 
  patients are sent to the floor 3 hours after delivery.( It used to be 24 hours 
  during 1995.) Patients not wanting to risk having labour pains during curfew 
  hours have also contributed to the congestion.</p>
<p>The Army HQ being closeby has also resulted in a constant intrusion of security 
  personnel into the hospital premises. The wall at the corner of Victoria Road 
  and Power House Road has been broken and a sentry point has been sited there, 
  making the staff anxious about moving to and from the nearby Intensive Care 
  Unit during the night.</p>
<p><b><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:Arial'>The general health of the 
  population:</span></b><br>
  An indicator of present conditions is the significant rise in infant mortality. 
  In times before the war the quality of life index for Jaffna District was among 
  the highest. Both the birth rate and infant mortality were below the national 
  average. Today infant mortality is about 30% higher than the national average 
  of around 33 per 1,000. Asked if the present disabilities faced by Jaffna Hospital 
  have had a significant adverse effect on the population, resulting in a higher 
  death rate, a senior doctor at the hospital replied that there would have been 
  an adverse effect, but at the same time it would be difficult to quantify. The 
  answer he said is more complicated. To begin with, he said, those who come to 
  the hospital are already a select group who are more knowledgeable than others. 
  The very poor often do not come at all. Much more important, he said, is the 
  breakdown of paramedical services and pre-natal care, particularly in the more 
  rural areas. He also confirmed that the effect of the Vanni returnees has been 
  to boost the adverse statistics significantly. </p>
<p>As for the more critical cases, he said, their transfer to Colombo is today 
  more streamlined because of the ICRC ship going every week. Giving an example 
  of a very critical case, he cited the case of a girl with a sub arachnoid bleed 
  who needed brain surgery. She had come to Jaffna hospital on a Monday in mid 
  May. On Tuesday she was flown to Colombo by an airforce plane. The catch here, 
  he said, was that her family had to pay for her air transport and for those 
  who accompanied her (Rupees 3,200/= per person). This is something that cannot 
  be afforded by those who are poor. But he felt that it may be possible to transfer 
  the expense away from the patient if the matter is taken up for discussion.<a

<p><b><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Post-mortem examinations</span></b> 
  <br>
  From what we have been able to find out, neither the Army nor any other section 
  of the security forces has applied any form of pressure on JTH as regards post-mortem 
  examinations. The shortcomings in these examinations, the senior doctor said, 
  have more to do with the lack of experience, exposure and specialised training 
  on the part of the doctors performing these examinations. Normally such persons 
  should have regular opportunity to discuss their work at conferences and also 
  have had specialised training abroad. These are among the handicaps faced by 
  young doctors in Jaffna. Some of the cases covered in our reports are instructive.</p>
<p>In our Special Report No 7, of August 1996, we recorded the case of the university 
  entrant who was tortured at the Kalviankaadu army camp, was admitted to Jaffna 
  Hospital when he started having fits and later died. The boy had an enlarged 
  kidney and high blood pressure, a condition deemed unconnected with torture. 
  The post-mortem examination also revealed a blood clot in the brain, almost 
  certainly connected with indiscriminate assault. The doctor was clear in his 
  mind that torture had been the cause of death. The hospital reported the matter 
  to the HQI, KKS Police. The HQI took the matter seriously and placed 12 soldiers 
  under arrest. The army captain at the camp approached a doctor concerned and 
  wanted to know the cause of death. He wanted to protect his men and kept arguing 
  that the enlarged kidney was the cause of death. The doctor refused to discuss 
  the matter further. But he was clear that no intimidation was involved. A judicial 
  officer visited Jaffna and the doctor agreed to testify in court at Anuradhapura. 
  As is too often the case in such situations, nothing more was heard. The senior 
  doctor added that even today, if the hospital authorities reported any finding 
  of foul play to the police, the normal investigation and arrest would take place. 
  But whether things would go beyond that is yet to be demonstrated. </p>
<p>In the same report (Sp. Rp 7) we reported abuses at Kaladdy army camp. During 
  the same period the body of a youth was sent to JTH by the army who claimed 
  that he had died in a shooting incident. On the surface this seemed acceptable. 
  But later one doctor noticed that there was an entry wound, but no exit wound. 
  He became suspicious, as when he returned to Jaffna in April last year, he found 
  a knife left behind by a soldier who had been in the house. It was of the kind 
  that was driven into a person and then given a twist. He got a technician to 
  x-ray the corpse and found that there was no bullet found in the body. He concluded 
  that the youth had died from stabbing. But it is not known whether he this recorded 
  his conclusion. Often working in an environment where there is no seriousness 
  about taking action, doctors doing post-mortem examinations tend to become despondent 
  over the seeming futility of their work. Now for two cases dealt with in the 
  present report .</p>
<p>We referred to doubts concerning the cause of death of 9 civilians in connection 
  with Ponnalai mine explosion of 29th January 1997. The Army had claimed that 
  the mine explosion rather than firing by the soldiers had been the cause of 
  death. The senior doctor who spoke to us said that there was no finding to contradict 
  the army's version. There were no bullets found in any of the bodies. But, he 
  added that this was corroboratory as regards the Army's claim, but not confirmatory. 
  He said that one normally does not find bullets in the body as they generally 
  pass through leaving an entry wound and an exit wound. In the Ponnali incident 
  no foreign particles were found in the bodies. Apart from objects hitting the 
  body in an explosion, death could also occur, he said, due to tissue damage 
  from the air hammer effect, leaving no external injury. He said that given the 
  fact that the Army's integrity in such matters is not rated high, one needs 
  to be more careful.</p>
<p>If after shooting a person, the Army subjects the body to a bomb explosion, 
  it would be difficult to determine the cause of death, unless the doctor concerned 
  was an expert who could distinguish between a bullet injury and an injury from 
  a particle shot out by an exploding mine also leaving entry and exit wounds. 
  It would, he said, have taken the calibre of someone like the late Professor.Saravanabavananthan 
  to make the distinction. He added that in the case of Ponnalai incident, local 
  opinion from the Moolai area seemed to suggest that the army's version was correct. 
  The doctor was then asked about the Puttur mine incident where the post-mortem 
  report seemed to have concluded that the 16 year old boy had died from the mine 
  explosion, whereas in fact, he was seen alive following the explosion. &quot;This 
  may be a case in the point I made,&quot; he replied, &quot;There was no intention 
  in the part of the doctors to give a false report. If the body had several injuries 
  of the kind described, death due to the mine explosion would have seemed a natural 
  conclusion. But these injuries could have been faked. The Jaffna Medical Association 
  is very concerned about maintaining a high standard of professionalism in post-mortem 
  examinations as is possible under present conditions,&quot; he concluded.<a
