'>Armed Muslims in Mutur</span></h1>
  <p>In recent years Muslim militancy gained ground as a reaction
    to the LTTE treating them very badly after the 2002 CFA. The LTTE resorted to
    abductions, killings and organised Tamil mobs to attack Muslims. An
    undercurrent of this activity was to constrict the space and economic life of
    Muslims, and importantly use terror as a means to keep Muslims out of certain
    areas. The LTTE was interested in circling Trincomalee harbour with its own
    military and naval bases to interdict the Navy’s use of the harbour whenever
    hostilities broke out. To this end the LTTE tried to dominate the land between
    Mutur and Kinniya in addition to Mutur East. (See Special Report 14 and
    Bulletin 33.) The Karuna split in 2004 made the LTTE’s ambitions in the East
    unrealistic.</p>
  <p>We mentioned earlier that Abdul Hakim, a Muslim militant
    leader in Mutur, was shot dead by the LTTE on 30<sup>th</sup> September 2005.
    Muslim groups were loosely called different names depending on the area. In
    Mutur there were two types of Muslim armed groups. One was generally referred
    to as the Osama group – just a label and nothing more, though during the
    anti-Muslim violence by the LTTE early in the CFA this seemed a useful name by
    which to refer to armed Muslims to promote the LTTE in the West. Armed Muslim
    activity in Mutur was purely a local reaction to the LTTE without further
    ramifications. </p>
  <p>After Hakim died the militants divided. One group remained
    armed. The other felt that Jihad is a deeper, ethically demanding concept that
    is much more than carrying arms and became a non-violent religious group. The
    second group became law abiding citizens and started exposing crimes of the
    militant section.</p>
  <p>Another set of armed Muslims is the home guards. Often in
    the same family, one would be a home guard, while another would be a militant
    without a state affiliation. The security forces did not bother about this as
    both served their purpose of controlling the LTTE by lawful and dirty means.</p>
  <p>With the CFA breaking down in 2006, the Government began
    using armed Muslim groups openly as they were using the Karuna group. They were
    used to target Tamils supposedly friendly to the LTTE, inasmuch as the LTTE
    continued to target Muslims. When the Government definitely decided to restart
    the war by May 2006, it wanted the International NGOs out. To this end the Army
    assigned an officer widely known as Captain Silva to use armed Muslim elements
    to do the job.</p>
  <p>From early May tensions built up with reports of the Army inducting members
    of the Karuna group and hosting them at Kattaiparichchan army camp as a prelude
    to an operation to capture Sampoor and Ralkuli. By 15<sup>th</sup> May,
    tensions reemerged between Muslims and Tamils because of some killings and
    disappearances on both sides. On 15<sup>th</sup> May, 700 Muslim people were
    reported displaced at 58th and 59th Milepost (Azathnagar, Jinnahnagar and
    Koorkandam). Mutur also saw some scare mongering with leaflets signed by such
    unknown groups as a Tamil Eelam Village Force of unknown origin threatening
    Muslims and Sinhalese to leave Tamil Eelam.  </p>
  <p>On 21<sup>st</sup> May grenades were thrown at the Mutur offices of the
    Non-Violent Peace Force (NVPF), ZOA and InterSOS, with no intention of harm to
    persons and at Emergency Architects a few days later. To a large extent such
    harassment succeeded. On the Magistrate pushing the Police, towards the end of
    July the Police arrested six persons in connection with the bomb throwing.</p>
  <p>We documented in Special Report No.26 the use of Muslim home guards on 10<sup>th</sup> June 2006 morning to murder Krishnapillai Ravichandran (43) of Menkamam who was
    returning home by bus with his wife from Mutur Hospital. The killing was done
    on a short stretch of the road in town where the Army was present. A home guard
    got into the bus, killed the victim, and unintentionally a 12-year-old boy, and
    just got down and went away. </p>
  <p>On the night of 15<sup>th</sup> June 2006, Emergency Architects was robbed.
    Two local security guards and two expatriates were threatened. Organisation
    money and documents from expatriates were stolen. While the earlier
    organisations functioned also in the LTTE-controlled area, Emergency Architects
    was involved in an uncontroversial housing scheme among Muslims and employed
    mainly Muslims. After this expatriates in Mutur left for a time. ACF was the
    first to return at the end of July.</p>
  <p>Two weeks before there was an attempt to extort money from a Saudi Arabian
    NGO. The extortionists were trapped in a sting operation where fake money was
    taken in a suitcase and the Police arrested those waiting to receive it. The
    string of attacks and attempted robbery during this period was an indication
    that something was brewing.</p>
  <p>The last incident was an interesting comment on what the Police hierarchy
    wanted. The sting was organised by Sub Inspector Athula, a man with a good
    reputation. He was then transferred out. According to persons close to him, the
    transfer was made on the order of DIG Rohan Abeywardene who was unhappy with
    Athula’s action in checking crime.  </p>
  <p>A number of persons were also remanded and a combination of home guards and
    militants was involved. The persons remanded over the robbery at Emergency
    Architects were militants Seiyathu M. Ameem and Kochi Mohamed Marzook. These
    two were in the remand prison in Mutur during the siege of August 2006. Someone
    at the Police Station, possibly home guards, had helped them to bend the gate
    of the cell and get out. There was no attempt to apprehend them later.</p>
  <p>Mohamed Haniffa Mohamed Fareed, a home guard, and another (possibly the well
    known criminal Amir Naheem), had been arrested in connection with attempted
    extortion of the Saudi NGO and sent to Trincomalee prison. Jehangir, a home
    guard and helper of the militants had been wanted for the extortion case. He fled
    Mutur and had returned two weeks before the siege. It was he who took part in
    the ACF massacre.</p>
  <p>A point that needs to be mentioned here concerns the group that functioned
    as a religious group after breaking off from the militants. In the Emergency
    Architects robbery case, two of them gave evidence before the Magistrate that
    led to the arrest of the culprits. They were Nazar and Ghazali. In connection
    with this case threatening calls had been made to the court and the Mudaliyar
    had been threatened. The witnesses had also told the court that they were under
    threat.</p>
  <p><b>After the Siege: Crackdown on the Militants</b></p>
  <p>During August 2006 itself the security forces had been tolerant of the
    Muslim militants and even helped them to get rid of their enemies. We reported
    the following in Special Report No.22 of 23<sup>rd</sup> August 2006:</p>
  <p>“<i>The Muslim refugees reached Kantalai on 5<sup>th</sup> August. That same
    evening S. Sriskandarajah, a Tamil tailor aged 35, was abducted after dusk and
    was found shot dead in a paddy field with his hands tied. On the 7<sup>th</sup> a Muslim woman relief worker had dinner at the home of a Tamil woman. The
    hostess remarked sadly over dinner, “They are catching our boys one by one,
    taking them and killing them.” After dinner she went to the Periatruveli (Moor
    through which the Big River flows) School, which had Muslim refugees and found
    the place in a commotion. She was told that some persons had come into the camp
    about 9.30 PM and woken up two sleeping refugee men. Those who came evidently
    knew the refugee men, who followed them into an auto rickshaw, which drove off.
    She also observed some masked security personnel who were posted in the camp
    supposedly to protect the refugees.</i> </p>
  <p>“<i>People were generally reticent about the affair, except to say that the
    men were important, who stood up for the community, and were planning to go to
    Ganewela the next day. The bodies of the two men with faces partially burnt
    were recovered from the neighbourhood about 3.30 AM. Subsequent inquiries
    identified the men as Nazar and Ghazali. Nazar’s story is a sad one. His wife
    died of her injuries when a shell struck Al Hilal School in Mutur. His daughter
    was injured by shelling at Kiranthimunai during the march. (She and her two
    brothers are now with their grand father.) Nazar was planning get a vehicle
    from Ganemulla to go back and collect his wife’s body. The people suspect that
    their murder may have to do with the robbery of an NGO in Mutur, for which
    Nazar and Ghazali gave evidence and had the robbers convicted. But the fact
    that the killers, whose identities cannot be hard to trace, got away so easily
    raises pertinent questions</i>.</p>
  <p>“<i>It appears likely that the killers here were Muslim criminal elements
    originally from Mutur, presently used by the security forces and placed in
    Kantalai to monitor the refugees coming in</i>.”</p>
  <p>That was the story of Nazar and Ghazali whose evidence helped to convict the
    robbers of Emergency Architects who escaped from the Mutur remand during the
    siege and are now free men. As for the atmosphere at the refugee camp from which
    the two hapless men were abducted and killed, we give a photograph below taken
    at the camp the same night Nazar and Ghazali were abducted and killed. The
    place was well guarded by policemen wearing masks.</p>
  <p>The State’s use of armed Muslims to screen the Muslim and Tamil displaced
    has a strange parallel with what the LTTE was doing. We have argued before that
    the LTTE’s purpose in taking Mutur and using the exodus, which they encouraged,
    to screen the refugees at Kinanthimunai, was to pick out and get rid of Muslims
    and Tamils close to the security forces or involved in armed activity against
    them. </p>
  <p><b>Crime as Part of Government Policy </b></p>
  <p>This meant that the police were using the same criminal elements calling
    themselves Osama or whatever to screen the refugee population coming into Mutur
    – both Muslims and Tamils – and helping them to get rid of enemies who exposed
    their crimes. Even stranger is the sighting of Jehangir in Kantali on Saturday
    5<sup>th</sup> August 2006, the day after the ACF massacre in which he took
    part. They were making good use of the motorcycles stolen from the ACF office
    to have another field day for their criminal activities in Kantalai, with the
    connivance of the Police.</p>
  <p>On 5<sup>th</sup> August 2006, Mathivanan who was the court mudaliyar in
    Mutur and was part of the exodus, was travelling to Trincomalee with AGA
    Seruvila, a Sinhalese, in the latter’s vehicle. Muslim thugs from Mutur who
    were under the patronage of the Police stopped them at Kantalai Junction. It
    became clear that they singled out Mathivanan, because some of the armed
    Muslims in Mutur had been remanded by the Mutur court over several crimes. The
    thugs threatened him, “<i>Your people threw our friends behind bars. We will
    kill you wherever you are</i>.” They also issued threats against the Mutur
    Magistrate.</p>
  <p>Mathivanan, recorded the incident in an appeal letter to the Judicial
    Service Commission, where he requested a transfer from Mutur because of threat
    to life. He took it to the JSC’s assistant secretary who refused to transfer
    him out of Mutur. Mathivanan had no choice but to resign his job. He is back at
    home in Kekirawa, teaching English for a living.  </p>
  <p>This falls into one pattern with Trincomalee DIG Abeywardene’s transfer of
    Sub Inspector Athula who apprehended the persons attempting extortion from a
    Saudi NGO. Indeed, extortion, abduction and murder involving Tamils and
    Muslims, where the Police turned a blind eye, had become standard fare in
    Colombo at that time. Crime was deliberate policy to cramp the minorities.  </p>
  <p>One event panicked the security forces and pushed them into cracking down on
    Muslim militants.</p>
  <p><b>One Show Ends, What Comes Next?</b></p>
  <p>We observed that two motorcycles were stolen from the Mutur ACF and the ACF
    had lodged a complaint about this. Before or about the end of August, two
    Muslim home guards were produced before the Magistrate for the theft of the
    motorcycles. They were Abdul Faleel Abdul Cader and Jamaldeen Muhamathu Imsham.
    The motorcycles were recovered in Kinniya. The two arrested said that they had
    found the motorcycles abandoned during a clearing mission. Of course they could
    not say that one at least was stolen in the presence of the Police and Navy
    commandos during the massacre.</p>
  <p>What rattled the authorities is that during the siege from 2<sup>nd</sup> to
    4<sup>th</sup> August, Cader and Imsham had being taking guns out of the Police
    Station and hiding them outside with the intention of selling or giving them to
    the militants. During the siege the Police were dependent on the home guards
    for intelligence and they were moving in and out. It was easy enough for them
    to walk out with a gun as though for their protection. Scores of firearms went
    missing, perhaps in the region of a hundred.</p>
  <p>Further, once the Government started capturing areas of the East under LTTE
    control, the threat from the LTTE receded and the Muslims also became upset by
    moves towards Sinhalisation. The latter took the form of claiming lands for
    possible Sinhalese settlement and putting up new Buddhist temples in contested
    sites. This was when the authorities became nervous about the loss of weapons
    from the Mutur Police Station.</p>
  <p>In June 2007, a CID team came from Colombo and began arresting Muslim
    militants and trying to recover weapons. Some weeks later the militants were
    released. According to local talk, they had all been tortured, given a severe
    thrashing and warned that they must not go to a hospital to dress their wounds.
    In early March 2008, the Police marched a companion of the notorious home guard
    Farook through Mutur in handcuffs. Evidently he was suspected of having arms. </p>
  <p>The honeymoon was over. But if the Tamil case is any guide, this will not be
    the end of the story when the community is left feeling bitter and cheated.
    Like in the Tamil case when the community felt alienated, the people backed the
    armed groups to a point, and then felt thoroughly disillusioned by their crimes
    and authoritarian approach. </p>
