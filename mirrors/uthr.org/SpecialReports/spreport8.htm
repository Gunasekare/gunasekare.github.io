<h3><a name="_Toc515698013">Summary</a></h3>
<p>The objective of this report is to highlight the deeply entrenched discriminatory 
  practices of the State machinery and the Armed Forces, as touched upon in Reports 
  11 and 12, using contemporary factual evidence as well as recent history. Trincomalee 
  District is a key example of why the people are unable to trust a Government 
  which remains too passive in its approach to tackling these problems. The fact 
  that refugees cannot return to their native areas still today demonstrates that 
  insecurity and poverty remain as impenetrable barriers. Settlement of communities 
  continues to be shaped by political ambitions and the approach of the Central 
  Government where too often partisan considerations prevail. The findings of 
  this report are presented to help those concerned to push for administrative 
  and political reform by addressing the problem in a realistic light. The present 
  Government has indeed established a political breathing space which was not 
  in existence before 1994. Having said this, efforts towards devolution will 
  not be fruitful unless the State begins to take steps towards gaining the confidence 
  of the people in the North-East. A fundamental change in ideology and an end 
  to discrimination are desperately needed before there can be any hope for a 
  peace with dignity for all.</p>
<p>The Trincomalee jail break serves as a primary example of a continuing unwillingness 
  on behalf of the State to bring perpetrators of gross human rights violations 
  to justice. Medical evidence has revealed indications of torture and that some 
  prisoners were deliberately shot at close range. Further information tells us 
  that many of the suspects involved were prisoners who were to be released soon 
  after and thereby having no reason for attempting to escape, and may have only 
  done so out of fear of reprisals. What resulted was a cover up by the Government 
  with NGOs and citizens either too fearful or simply not caring enough to help 
  find the truth.</p>
<p>There are a number of recent incidents which demonstrate the ideology being 
  imposed by the central governing powers on Trincomalee, the market fiasco being 
  one. In this case, a tender which was legally entitled to a bidder who was a 
  Tamil man was viewed as a threat to Sinhalese control over business, by both 
  the Army and local reactionary tendencies. What developed was a situation where 
  the Urban Council dared to stand up to the Brigadier's orders to revoke the 
  tender by use of emergency powers. In another case, a Tamil government officer 
  was denied the regular five year extension of office before retirement at 60, 
  clearly because he had challenged discriminatory land settlement practices by 
  the Army in the past. Further, the flaring of hatred following the killing of 
  land officer T.D. Pieris was yet another incident showing the volatility of 
  a situation where business and politics have become poisoned by communal tendencies, 
  furthering detrimental suspicions among the people.</p>
<p>While altering the ethnic balance in favour of the majority community in the 
  Trincomalee District has been the common practice of the State, the eviction 
  of Tamil settlers from lands such as Linga Nagar take on overt characteristics 
  of discrimination since pervasive fear renders public scrutiny and opposition 
  ineffective. The displacement of Muslims from areas such as Aakuwatte near Uppuveli 
  Vihara have involved a concerted effort of distortion of land claims as well 
  as supplying Sinhalese settled in their place with building materials.</p>
<p>Sinhalese and Muslim communities in the area have been forced to rely on protection 
  by the security forces due to a history of massacres by the LTTE. In villages 
  such as Dimbulagala, youth often join the Army out of sheer desperation to escape 
  poverty. Untrained civilians are sometimes forced to man security posts while 
  their wives at home may be harassed by Army personnel. The resulting social 
  problems and frustration of not knowing where to turn for security has become 
  largely ingrained.</p>
<p>Widely held suspicions have broken much of the friendly relations between the 
  communities of Trincomalee. Discrimination in practice by the Armed Forces and 
  the State, combined with blatant misinformation by the press in Colombo, continue 
  to fuel the fire. Unwillingness on behalf of the Government to investigate cases 
  of mass disappearances and extra-judicial executions which occurred not so long 
  ago, convince the people that protracted ill-will would remain business as usual. 
</p>
<p>The responsibility for reform of the State machinery lies not only with the 
  Government but also with the people. If Tamils who have the privilege to live 
  abroad continue to thoughtlessly support the LTTE, then the progressive demise 
  of all communities which remain in the East and the values of civilised humanity 
  will continue. The LTTE would rather have Tamils continue as refugees while 
  the organisation remains trapped in its inertia unable to negotiate an honourable 
  peace or conclude the war in its favour. What is needed is room for discussion 
  among all communities and a Government which is actively committed to ending 
  the discrimination which is built into the State and administrative machinery. 
  The youth, with their past experiences of militancy and sacrifice for better 
  and for worse, must be encouraged as organisers of the peace movement. The confidence 
  of the people must be established long before the displaced can return to their 
  homes, long before communities can freely work together, and long before any 
  proposals for devolution can be respected. <a href="#a">[Top]</a></p>
<h3><br>
  <a name="_Toc515698014">Why this report?</a></h3>
<p>Unlike our usual reports that deal in matters more directly related to violence, 
  conflict and the hurt caused to vulnerable groups, this one concentrates on 
  state structures and ideology. These are no doubt the root cause of the civil 
  war that began in earnest in late 1984, and are among the chief obstructions 
  to a political resolution. The political package now being discussed is a move 
  in the right direction. But unless the Government displays a will to tackle 
  the issue of state structures and ideology independently, the political package 
  too may prove a meaningless exercise.</p>
<p>Trincomalee is an area where the damaging and discriminatory practices of state 
  structures are most deeply entrenched, and have shown no change for the better 
  under the present Government. It would serve the cause of peace well if the 
  Government would make an effort to understand the situation and make Trincomalee 
  a model of how different communities can realise their common interest of harmonious 
  co-existence. If on the other hand the Sinhalese in such areas see any just 
  and adequate political resolution , necessarily involving considerable regional 
  autonomy, as transferring the boot to the other foot - where the minorities 
  will do as they were done by - peace would long elude us. Confidence building 
  must therefore be an exercise independent of the package. In part it involves 
  cleaning the Augean stables that comprise the state machinery.</p>
<p>The problem is again highlighted in an answer given by the President in a recent 
  television interview. She elaborated her claim that her Government had tackled 
  the problem of 'state terror' within a short time of assuming office. By this 
  she meant that the Government no longer encourages nor orders security personnel 
  to indulge in violations, and has up to a point taken measures to discourage 
  them. The main reason why the Government has made little or no qualitative impact 
  is that this is too passive an approach to structures and practices that are 
  very deeply entrenched, have a life of their own and are so alienating to the 
  minorities. They call for hard-headed positive action.</p>
<p>Introduction: It has never been our intention to make our reports catalogues 
  of misery. But rather we would also like to point out signs of hope for the 
  reader to meditate upon and if possible contribute to their enhancement. In 
  the course of what follows below we will point to a theme that has its reflections 
  in two very different situations. The North and the South of this country have 
  both a valuable resource - youth who have participated in militant struggles, 
  have had time to reflect on their experience and have matured politically over 
  the years. The common tendency is to treat them as flotsam and jetsam from a 
  past that most people would like to forget. Yet many of them represent a section 
  of society imbued with a spirit of sacrifice and trained to endure present discomfort 
  for long - term goals. It would be fair to say that it is such persons who comprise 
  the back bone of the peace movement in this country. Owing to the fact that 
  internal terror is still dominant within the Tamil community, few Tamil youths 
  with a militant past have found themselves able to play an active role, and 
  indeed the intellectual discussion in the Tamil media that would help them to 
  do so remains largely stifled. This is the principal challenge facing the Tamil 
  community in this crucial period of change. </p>
<p>Before taking up this theme in Tamankaduwa (Polonnaruwa District), we set the 
  scene with an incident that points to the role of the State in Trincomalee that 
  has been a constant feature of all governments.<a href="#a">[Top]</a></p>
<h3><a name="_Toc515698015">The Jail Break</a></h3>
<p><br>
  On the night of 30th October 1996, some LTTE prisoners made a planned escape 
  from the Military cum Police detention centre for LTTE suspects in Customs Road 
  in Trincomalee Town. Many details of the incident appeared as the lead story 
  in the Island of 1st November. `Five Tigers killed in Trinco jail break', the 
  title chosen, as we shall see below, was utterly misleading. The report from 
  Colombo contained as much as could be obtained by telephoning Trincomalee a 
  few hours after the event. The report gave some disturbing testimony from a 
  senior officer of the Human Rights Task Force in Trincomalee. He said that two 
  of the alleged escapees killed could not be identified because their faces were 
  disfigured by gunshot injuries. It is a fair surmise that the two at least were 
  not in the act of escaping and had been shot deliberately at close range. As 
  most often happens where Tamils are concerned, the story was not followed up 
  even though the censorship had been lifted three weeks earlier. Indeed, after 
  the headline reference to `Five Tigers killed', there was no room for a follow 
  up that brought out foul play on the part of the authorities.</p>
<p>The true fate of the five prisoners killed began to emerge through testimonies 
  given in confidence. This was further confirmed by the state of the corpses. 
</p>
<p>Of those killed Krishnapillai Meharasa (22), Ward 7, Kirankulam; and Nallaratnam 
  Sasi(19), Senaithurai, Mahaloor, Kaluwanchikudy, were from Batticaloa District. 
  Achchuthan Irajasekaran(27), 677 Anbuvelipuram; Shanmugam Pushpakaran (25), 
  Varodayanagar, Sambaltivu, and Thiyagarajah Nagaratnam (30) , 64/4, UNHCR camp, 
  Alles Garden, were from Trincomalee District.</p>
<p>They had all been detained between mid-February and early June 1996. In the 
  case of Pushpakaran, his corpse had an eye badly damaged, a tooth broken and 
  the stomach had been pierced. It was a case of a person who was tortured and 
  killed. He was married to Mangala (20), had a year old son and was arrested 
  on 5th June`96 near the 3rd Mile Post security post between home and Trinco 
  town. He was held by the police, produced in court a month later on 5/7, again 
  on 18/7 and then transferred to Army detention on 26/8.</p>
<p>The case of Nagaratnam ought to be even more a matter of international concern. 
  He had left the LTTE, married , gone to India as a refugee and returned on the 
  basis of what was essentially a guarantee by the UNHCR. He was arrested on 6th 
  March, spent 2 months in police detention and then was transferred to army custody. 
  He was produced in court on 8/8/96. He was to be released on 5th Nov. 96. These 
  persons were just technically suspects against whom no case had been made, and 
  whose detention was being periodically renewed. Achuchuthan for example had 
  been in the process of being released. His release date was 13th Nov. 96, and 
  so had no reason to escape.</p>
<p>The press report claimed that further investigations were to be conducted under 
  Chief Inspector E.Mahendra, HQI Trincomalee and that the military was to launch 
  a high level inquiry into the incident. Not surprisingly, nothing further has 
  been heard. The incident took place near a middle-class residential area of 
  Trincomalee. Yet in talking to people, hardly any one seemed to know anything 
  definite. No two versions seemed to agree. The priest in the neighbourhood through 
  whom two of the escapees reportedly surrendered, would only say that he was 
  not in Trincomalee at that time. There had been no activist group to marshal 
  the facts, provide assurances to the witnesses and press for action. This is 
  hardly the situation of lack of information or interest that one would encounter 
  in, say, Batticaloa. The fear of knowing too much and saying too much was very 
  real. What should have been a matter for concerted public pressure was dissipated 
  in private gossip.</p>
<p>We give the facts as pieced together from several sources. The LTTE `suspects' 
  were kept in a two storey building. The cells were on the ground floor. Upstairs 
  was used by the military police. The atmosphere there had become friendly. At 
  7.30 pm the prisoners used to be let out of their cells for dinner which was 
  followed by a sing - song from 8.00 pm, after which the prisoners were locked 
  up. When the military police were given a TV set, the prisoners used to be invited 
  upstairs to watch TV or videos at 8.00 p.m.- all completely against regulations. 
  On the night of the escape there were three or four military policemen seated 
  on a bed, two policemen seated on chairs and 26 prisoners seated on the floor, 
  all watching a video. The police appear to reckon that 7 or 8 of the 26 had 
  LTTE involvement. This figure of 7 or 8 as the reader might surmise, seems to 
  include those who had LTTE connections in the past and were leading ordinary 
  civilian lives when detained as suspects. </p>
<p>The escape it appears was planned no more than by four or five prisoners with 
  the others knowing nothing - had they known, they had a vested interest in tipping 
  off the guards. That night these persons had placed themselves close to the 
  policemen. About 10.30 p.m. they set upon the policemen and grabbed their revolvers 
  and shot the military policemen, of whom Corporal Bandara died. The two policemen 
  quickly escaped unharmed. Those who planned the escape got away by jumping over 
  the wall. Most of the rest followed not because they wanted to escape, but did 
  so fearing reprisals. Indeed, many had release dates coming up in November. 
</p>
<p>One of them jumped onto the tin roof of a lavatory in a neighbouring house 
  and broke his leg when the roof gave way. As the alarm was given the security 
  men began firing. They were also joined by other security personnel, including 
  the Harbour Police. The nearby residents were put up and their houses were searched 
  while firing noises were heard. Three or four of the escapees were seen running 
  towards the beach . One version suggests that a boat was waiting for them. The 
  more plausible version coming from the police is that they were seen running 
  along the beach and had then escaped along side North Coast Road, after dropping 
  a seized weapon on the beach.</p>
<p>By about 12.30 am firing noises had ceased. A little later neighbours heard 
  one prisoner being moved along the road by the prison shouting, &quot;Aiyo amma 
  ( mother) do not beat me&quot;. A little later a single shot was heard. This 
  was the end of the prisoner who had fallen into the lavatory.</p>
<p>Five bodies were found on the beach the following morning near the Buddhist 
  monument. According to witnesses all had injures in the head from firing at 
  close range. Sources close to prison officials said that four among the dead 
  were persons who had not escaped. Witnesses who were about near the monument 
  to the victims of the Welikade jail massacre, opened by the TELO that same month, 
  said that they saw these persons being brought out and shot.</p>
<p>There are also other corroborating circumstances. The four other than the man 
  who fell into the lavatory, appear to have been killed while there was regular 
  firing from the vicinity of the prison. A tractor and trailer were forcibly 
  removed from the Urban Council premises that were later returned with blood- 
  stains in the trailer. This is said to have been used to transport the five 
  bodies from the vicinity of the prison to the beach. The security authorities 
  later claimed that a weapon was recovered from one of those found dead on the 
  beach.</p>
<p>As for the other prisoners, circumstances suggest that their main problem was 
  not how to escape, but how to surrender. Ranjithakumar and another prisoner 
  had spent the night hiding in the Calvary monument at the nearby St. Mary's 
  church and had surrendered through the parish priest the following morning. 
  Krishnadasan, Singarasa Sivaarasan, Puratchidasasn and Sandirasingham surrendered 
  through Sub- Inspector Ubaithullah of the CID. Five others were reportedly picked 
  up from around town. Of these Sivarasan had been a Sea Tiger who had left the 
  organisation.</p>
<p>The HRTF knew the facts and ought to have raised the matter and informed the 
  President as it was bound to do. The MP for the area raised the matter in parliament. 
  But with no organised follow-up locally, the matter ended there. The shameful 
  incident remains effectively covered up.</p>
<p>With much apparently going for Trincomalee to check such incidents or ensure 
  that proper action is taken, all systems seem to have failed. Several international 
  NGOs including the ICRC and the UNHCR are represented in Trincomalee. There 
  are a number of local NGOs. The judicial authorities too could not be drawn 
  into commenting on the incident. The only action known to have been taken is 
  that the two police officers who were watching the video were interdicted. The 
  surviving prisoners who should have been key witnesses in any proper investigation, 
  continued to be held in the same vulnerable conditions.</p>
<p>The victims of the incident were persons who were routinely remanded at the 
  request of the security forces. In sharp contrast 11 soldiers who were identified 
  at considerable personal risk by civilians as having participated in the massacre 
  at Killiveddy during February 1996, were released on bail by the Acting Magistrate 
  of Trincomalee during June the same year, to return to active duties. The failure 
  to bring these men to trial has been cited as one of the failures to enforce 
  the law in the recent Country Report released by the US State Department. While 
  the Acting Magistrate claims that he did what was required by the law in view 
  of the failure by the Attorney General to file charges within three months, 
  others knowledgeable in the law maintain that it is the High Court and not the 
  Magistrate's Court that is empowered to grant bail to any one remanded on charges 
  of homicide. The Acting Magistrate further denies that he was under any pressure 
  from the Army to grant bail. </p>
<p>The Army Brigadier in charge of Trincomalee has powers of court martial to 
  take disciplinary action against the men concerned in both the incidents above 
  in the best interests of the Army. He did nothing of that kind. What moved him 
  to action in December 1996 was something most singular. Citing a `deteriorating 
  security situation' in the Trincomalee market area, he moved to cancel the tender 
  for the market legally awarded to a Tamil individual. </p>
<p>These are reflections of the continuing nature of the State that is at the 
  root of current problems around Trincomalee town, that have made land settlement, 
  the arrival of Tamil refugees from the North and even the control of the market 
  highly sensitive issues. In these matters the Government has been seen to vacillate 
  between the mean and the infantile. <a href="#a">[Top]</a></p>
<h3><a name="_Toc515698016">'Distortions of broad settlement patterns':</a></h3>
<p>One aspect of this is the most unusual step taken by the Defence Ministry in 
  confining Tamil refugees arriving from the North(Vanni) in so called welfare 
  centres in Vavuniya. Conditions for them to move out and go to a place of their 
  choice in Vavuniya town, the South or East of the same country where they are 
  fellow citizens is governed by extremely stringent conditions. These generally 
  involve paper work, documents and letters of acceptance to establish that the 
  internal refugee is a permanent resident of, or has a close relative such as 
  a parent, spouse or child residing in, these areas. Several people in frustration 
  went back to the LTTE controlled Vanni with all its privations. Those willing 
  to go to Jaffna, other alternatives unavailing, were most readily accepted, 
  transported to Trincomalee, kept in camps, loaded into ships often after waiting 
  hours in a queue under the sun and shipped off to Jaffna.</p>
<p>The policy came in for severe criticism in the foreign press. This liability 
  applied only to Tamils in the North. Security reasons cited did not justify 
  the degree of harshness especially considering that other avenues for LTTE infiltration 
  were wide open. Moreover many of those being confined were elderly, women and 
  children. The Defence Ministry issued a press release on 5th December 1996 confirming 
  that it had very much in mind reasons other than security. It contained the 
  sentiment : &quot;As a matter of principle, mass movements of persons in a situation 
  of this nature cannot be permitted to develop into distortions of broad settlement 
  patterns without creating undue tensions&quot;.</p>
<p>The last part of the sentence could only apply to Vavuniya, and particularly, 
  to Trincomalee whose Sinhalisation was a foregone conclusion by the early 80s. 
  It was distortions by 'broad settlement patterns' of Sinhalese that successive 
  governments had been trying to bring about in the Trincomalee District with 
  the Defence Ministry taking an increasingly prominent role. As a matter of policy 
  every Government Agent(GA) appointed to the majority Tamil-speaking district 
  from the 60s has been Sinhalese. A concerted attempt to speed up Sinhalisation 
  was undertaken by the new UNP government of J.R. Jayawardene elected in 1977. 
  In the late 70s and early 80s under Mr.D.J. Bandaragoda as GA, large extents 
  of crown land were brought under the control of various government ministries 
  by gazette notification. The employees of these corporations were mostly Sinhalese 
  brought from outside. Sinhalese encroachers were encouraged to move in under 
  the patronage of government ministers, Buddhist monks or local Sinhalese merchants 
  around Trincomalee market who were invariably agents of either the UNP or the 
  SLFP. A new order of local power was so being fostered with the active patronage 
  of the security forces. A case in point concerning encroachments is that the 
  Ports Authority(SLPA) at no time used more than 100 acres of the 5000 it had 
  acquired. At Premadasa's Trincomalee Presidential Mobile Secretariat on 6th 
  January 1993, the case of Sinhalese squatters on these lands came up. The SLPA 
  obligingly offered to release 700 acres to regularise these encroachments. Some 
  of these encroachments on the west side of 4th to 6th mile post on the Colombo 
  road were regularised about 1994.</p>
<p>From 1977 communal violence in which recently settled Sinhalese elements were 
  mobilised with the connivance of the armed forces was used to bring about the 
  displacement of Tamil and Muslim civilians. Some of the merchants around Trincomalee 
  market too saw violence as a means to enhance their commercial advantage. From 
  the mid-80s and then again in 1990, the armed forces played a direct role in 
  the destruction of Tamil property and the displacement of inhabitants in the 
  suburbs of Trincomalee town and in the rural villages of the district. From 
  1977 to 1992, upwards of 1400 Tamil civilians were killed or went missing in 
  the Trincomalee District. The worst period was June 1990 - March 91 when about 
  870 youths disappeared after being detained by the security forces. About 100 
  were killed during July 1983. [See our reports 10,11 &amp; 12 for more details.] 
  <a href="#a">[Top]</a> </p>
<h3><a name="_Toc515698017">Sinhalese fears and psychology of the armed forces</a></h3>
<p>A combination of events led to the first attack by Tamil hoodlum elements against 
  Sinhalese civilians in September 1987. The Indian Peace Keeping Force had arrived 
  in early August. Tamil militant groups opposed to the LTTE had returned to town 
  and there was a new assertiveness on the part of the Tamils. There was also 
  growing friction between the Indian Army and the Sri Lankan Army which took 
  being confined to barracks very badly. On one occasion a Sri Lankan Army vehicle 
  speeding past the Town Hall opened fire at a group of Indian Army men and local 
  civilians which included Brigadier Joshi. About this time around 2000 Tamil 
  youths who had been confined at Boosa without charges were shipped to Trincomalee 
  and released under terms of the Indo-Lanka Accord. </p>
<p>One day Tamil hoodlums started attacking Sinhalese with the backing of certain 
  militant leaders. Some of the local civilians helplessly observed some horrendous 
  scenes of cruelty. An old man who went to a Tamil house to purchase milk for 
  his grand-daughter when confronted by Tamil hoodlums pleaded for his life from 
  the lady of the house. She was unable to stop them chasing the man and beating 
  him to death. A Sinhalese lorry driver was assaulted and his lorry was set on 
  fire. As he emerged crawling from under the burning lorry, he was lifted and 
  thrown into the flames screaming. Witnesses also spoke of Sinhalese women being 
  raped and killed. Several bodies were thrown into a well that was covered up. 
  According to these witnesses in the region of 50 Sinhalese were murdered in 
  the area around the main Sinhalese school, east of Inner Harbour Road on the 
  isthmus. These Sinhalese were long settled there and had been close to the Tamils.</p>
<p>The mob moved northwards towards Anuradhapura junction raiding liquor shop 
  after liquor shop on its way before tottering to exhaustion. By that time the 
  Indian Army had also intervened. According to a widely believed story, elements 
  of Tamil militant groups had been given a few hours by a section of the Indian 
  Army to clear the Sinhalese before they intervened. The cycle of cynicism and 
  mischief was to go on bringing further distrust among the civilians and complicating 
  matters at every turn. According to documentation presented in Narayanan Swamy's 
  `Tigers of Lanka' Brigadier Kobbekaduwa who took charge of the Sri Lankan forces 
  in Trincomalee about that time was instrumental in supplying arms to the LTTE 
  which had commenced a war with the Indian Army, during the middle of 1988. This 
  was done irrespective of the fact that the LTTE had never stopped attacking 
  Sinhalese civilians and had been responsible for massacres during the same period.</p>
<p>Following the event above, a large number of Sinhalese fled as refugees. Although 
  most of them returned, they never regained the confidence that the Sri Lankan 
  State was ultimately willing to or capable of protecting them. This has persisted 
  despite the fact that the old-order returned after June 1990 with the town area 
  firmly under the Sri Lankan Army &amp; other security forces and police under 
  Sinhalese leadership and the administration essentially controlled by Sinhalese. 
  It is notable that when the Sri Lankan forces went on a binge in June 1990, 
  the Sinhalese population and merchants kept aloof. The politics had become too 
  murky for anyone to take sides.</p>
<p>For the defence establishment too there was the persisting unease and a feeling 
  of self-doubt, that their ideological goal of Sinhalisation that had seemed 
  so certain in the mid-80s and on which they had staked much, had been thwarted. 
  From the point of their goal, talk of decentralisation and a political settlement 
  brought more uncertainties. Another factor adding to their unease is the arrival 
  after 1990 from the North of a Tamil refugee population who have bought property 
  and settled down.</p>
<p>Further there are now in Trincomalee town armed Tamil militant groups who though 
  in one sense junior partners of the armed forces in fighting the LTTE, also 
  support the present Government in parliament. This has given them a, perhaps 
  illusory, measure of autonomy. Given their past experience, Tamil civilians 
  though not necessarily liking them, see them as a useful counterweight to what 
  they see as a Sinhalese army and police. This in turn has spurred some of these 
  groups to go in for populist actions that are counterproductive in the long 
  run.</p>
<p>These in turn have enhanced the fears of the local Sinhalese population who 
  had a bad experience in 1987. Although relations between the communities are 
  normal on the surface, the deeper suspicions are seldom talked about openly 
  and mutual fear lurks underneath. Each community continues to hold on to very 
  dissimilar interpretations of events based on half truths and falsehood. The 
  press contributed much to keep Sinhalese suspicions on the boil by giving ample 
  space to extreme nationalist spokesmen in Colombo whose knowledge of the ground-reality 
  in Trincomalee is scant. As we shall see below the press often gives total misrepresentations 
  of facts and events and are calculated to feed Sinhalese suspicions. </p>
<p>It is this background that would help to explain the attitudes of the Defence 
  Ministry to the land issues in Trincomalee, tenders for the Trinco market and 
  'distortions of broad settlement patterns' that would otherwise seem idiosyncratic. 
  We must also keep in mind that the State and its essentially repressive and 
  discriminatory structures will remain the most decisive force around Trincomalee 
  with the capacity to do the greatest harm. <a href="#a">[Top]</a></p>
<h3><a name="_Toc515698018">Dimbulagala, Tamankaduwa</a></h3>
<p>Some remarkable speeches were made at a peace meeting organised by the Sri 
  Lanka Solidarity Forum held in the local conference hall at Dimbulagala. A number 
  of peasants from the surroundings had been present there after finishing their 
  day's work. Dayawansa, a member of the Provincial Council spoke on the theme 
  of a majority becoming a minority. He said that before the Mahaweli Scheme was 
  instituted the majority of the people in the area were Tamils. The chairman 
  of the Village Council at Mannampitiya was a Tamil. Under the Mahaweli scheme 
  the lands on which the Tamils had been cultivating were taken over by the Mahaweli 
  Authority. When lands were given under the Mahaweli Scheme many Tamils were 
  left out, and today these Tamils suffer many disabilities. Today, he said, there 
  are 80 Tamil children in Dimbulagala who are unable to attend school. Such experiences, 
  he said, are at the root of the present conflict. Another speaker was Dharmasri 
  Liyanage, an official of the Samurdhi Movement and a farmer in Mannampitiya 
  . He said that he grew up in Batticaloa and left in 1985 when the troubles began. 
  When he came to Mannampitiya his Sinhalese had been imperfect and he had often 
  substituted Tamil words in his speech. He had later served in the police for 
  a time. He had witnessed the Sri Lankan Army looting Tamil houses from which 
  the owners had been chased away, and retrieving jewellery from nooks where they 
  had been hidden by those fleeing. In Mannampitiya, there are today 80 families 
  who had not been given land by the Mahaweli Authority that had taken over the 
  land on which they had previously cultivated. In this land on which the Tamils 
  had been a majority, they now cannot get their official work done in Tamil. 
  They often need to hang around government offices until they find someone who 
  could translate from Tamil to Sinhalese.</p>
<p>These speeches were more remarkable considering that this was the home-base 
  of the late Dimbulagala Thero who had led a crusade of 5,000 people with the 
  connivance of the Mahaweli Authority to occupy lands used by Tamils to the east 
  across Madhuru Oya in the wake of the July 1983 violence. </p>
<p>Since that time the press and a number of well connected militant Sinhalese 
  based in Colombo have represented Dimbulagala as a bastion of heroic Sinhalese 
  resistance to the Tamil menace. When reporting on these border areas, press-men 
  have regularly relished photographs of peasant women carrying shot guns. In 
  the course of such reporting, the humanity and ordinary human aspirations of 
  these people have been suppressed. The real life of these people is on the other 
  hand a tragedy imposed on them by the dominant Sinhalese ideology of the State 
  of which they too are of victims. The audience listened patiently and were obviously 
  looking for a change in the course of this country's history. The pervasive 
  influence of the ideas of the late Dimbulagala Thero on these people is again 
  a myth created by the press.</p>
<p>Nimal Munasinghe, the local organiser of the peace movement is a much respected 
  English teacher in the area based at Nidanwela Central School. He was one of 
  the rebels during the 1971 JVP insurgency, who then spent a few years in prison 
  and married a fellow prisoner from a family of women rebels. He has continued 
  to be politically active. It is clear that the people look up to him and are 
  receptive to his ideas. The people of the area have suffered immensely from 
  the war. Over the years there had been more than 50 LTTE attacks in the area 
  claiming more than 60 lives of civilians. Many of the people are unable to use 
  their lands. Consequently several men from the area have joined the armed forces. 
  The protection given to the villages too is not adequate to prevent LTTE incursions. 
  It was reported that equipment from the conference centre too was robbed by 
  the LTTE. Even worse soldiers had often forced untrained civilians to man the 
  bunkers, and in complaints reminiscent of Weli Oya, had crept into their homes 
  and harassed their women. This caused many social problems in the area that 
  had become very much impoverished. Such practices, it is said, had decreased 
  after PA government assumed power.</p>
<p>Shortly after sun set, as the home guards were taking up their positions in 
  the bunkers, we were taken to the last sentry point to the east that was manned 
  by five soldiers. This point had been attacked after night fall on three occasions 
  and in one attack two soldiers had been killed. By the side of the sentry point 
  is the house of Mr Somapala of the All Lanka Peasants Congress who died of natural 
  causes a few days ago. During 1995, two of his sons-in-law who were farmers 
  were hacked to death by the LTTE in the paddy field, about quarter mile east 
  from their home. Especially from that time Somapala had become an ardent campaigner 
  for peace. This was the village of Arunapura, lying on the edge of the main 
  village of Aralagamavilla. Also recently police constable Susil Nandana, the 
  husband of a grand daughter of Somapala's, was killed in action, leaving his 
  18 year old wife widowed with an infant child. Normally the house would have 
  been empty by this time, as the inmates sought safety in a house further to 
  the interior. Owing to funeral observances this period was an exception. Five 
  youths from Arunapura are said to be serving in the army.</p>
<p>Looking eastwards from the army post one could witness flickering lights in 
  empty huts meant to dissuade elephants from coming into the paddy fields. Across 
  the Madhuru Oya (River) two miles away, lies Padduvankarai in the Batticaloa 
  District, where too life for the Tamil peasants must be no less miserable. But 
  the situation there is one where no active peace movement can take shape. This 
  is another aspect of the internal tragedy of the Tamils. </p>
<p>The misery of 87 Tamil families in Dimbulagala is hardly ever mentioned or 
  written about. They are a forgotten people with no one to speak for them. The 
  children used to attend an old Tamil school towards the jungle where they had 
  to spend a good part of the morning clearing buffalo dung. Since the onset of 
  the war the children had stopped going there. Nimal Munasinghe said that although 
  school space can be found for them nearby, this has not been done. He had also 
  found it difficult to highlight this in the press. An even deeper tragedy of 
  the Tamil families is that in 40 out of the 87 families the men folk are missing. 
  According to Munasinghe the families maintained that the men had been finished 
  off by the Army, while several of the Sinhalese claimed that they had joined 
  the LTTE. This also reflects the state of suspicion against these Tamil families. 
  It has been claimed that some of the youths from the area have ties with the 
  LTTE and were instrumental in the murder of Dimbulagala Thero during mid-1995. 
</p>
<p>During the night we encountered another problem that is quite typical of the 
  area. An elderly lady R.B.Somawathy, originally from Bibile, and her elder son, 
  Jayathilake(21), a home guard working under the police, sought out Nimal Munesinghe. 
  Somawathy's younger son Rajapaksa had joined the army when he was 18, had later 
  deserted and was working as a tailor in the village. He was arrested by the 
  police when the government ordered all deserters to return. He then absconded 
  again when the police sent him to a shop to buy something. He was re-arrested 
  and in the course of assaulting him, the police broke his arm. He is now remanded 
  in the custody of Polonnaruwa police. The mother was concerned about her son's 
  medical condition. She could scrape up Rs 3,000 for the lawyer's fees in Polonnaruwa, 
  but it was difficult to find lawyers in these parts willing to take up cases 
  against the security forces. Those such as Munasinghe were among the rare persons 
  to whom she could turn for help. </p>
<p>Technically Rajapaksa by deserting had acted in breach of the law. But this 
  was a predicament that was very unlikely to be faced by a boy from a well-placed 
  middle-class home in Colombo that was comfortable with the war. The two acres 
  of land which the family had been given was very inadequate to be shared among 
  the children. Alternative employment is hard to come by. It would have been 
  very hard for a young boy who had known only the mother's affection to go into 
  the army and be assaulted and abused by the sergeant in the course of breaking 
  him. Unable to take it, Rajapaksa made his escape. Now the government wants 
  Rajapaksa back, not for his own good, but to use him as cannon fodder.</p>
<p>These are other aspects of the legacy of state ideology based on narrow Sinhalese 
  nationalism, that has brought only tragedy to these people. The lands on the 
  other side of Madhuru Oya, once taken over by the Dimbulagala Thero in the crusading 
  zeal that followed the July 1983 violence, now lie bare of inhabitants. Even 
  older settlements such as Maligatenne on the western side of Madhuru Oya, had 
  been abandoned. It has indeed been a harvest of blood and misery. <a href="#a">[Top]</a></p>
<h3><a name="_Toc515698019">Law of the Jungle and the Trivialising of the State</a></h3>
<p>We now go into an investigation of some current problems confronting Trincomalee, 
  two of which have been much in the news. Indeed they would hardly have been 
  newsworthy had the authorities applied the law impartially without harbouring 
  an agenda that was hurtful to the minorities. How these problems have been dealt 
  with at the highest levels of a government that in many ways represents a change 
  for the better from past governments is a sad comment on the state of the country. 
  These cases below also give a gloomy picture of the levels to which the State 
  and administrative machinery have degenerated particularly at a time when a 
  political solution is being sought to end a wasteful ethnic conflict. Indeed 
  a far higher standard of administrative integrity is called for. </p>
<p>In land matters that further Sinhalisation in keeping with state ideology, 
  the different government ministries and departments have the capacity to work 
  together very expeditiously. The instances of Ports Authority land and the acquisition 
  of Muslim squatter land by the Uppuveli Vihara which was itself originally built 
  on crown land have been cited. Brigadier Lucky Wijeratne settled squatters along 
  Colombo road on forest reserve in 1990 and in the meantime got the land de-reserved 
  and regularised. When Tamil residents in Love Lane who fled their houses in 
  1990 found Sinhalese occupying them when they returned, two powerful ministers 
  in the last government intervened in an effort to have the Tamils shifted to 
  alternative housing. On the other hand when it comes to public uses of land 
  where Tamils and Muslims would benefit, obstructions are thrown up that carry 
  little reason. A particular instance of related obstructiveness is the case 
  of the Tamil officer given in the sequel.</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc515698020">1. Displacement of Muslims from Aakuwatte (now Pansalwatte), 
  Uppuveli</a></h3>
<p>At the outset of the war in June 1990 the LTTE attacked the police station 
  in Uppuveli and ran away. In the resulting pandemonium Tamil refugees streamed 
  out of Trincomalee and the barons of local power did not fail to use the security 
  forces to carry through their agendas. The victims of one such event were the 
  50 or so Muslim families of Aakuwatte, squatters originally from 7th Mile Post 
  (Iqbal Nagar), Nilaveli Road, who had been there from about 1980. They had evidently 
  moved there at the invitation of a Muslim mill owner who sought security from 
  the Sinhalese squatter settlements beyond.</p>
<p>On 13th June 1990 the Police set fire to their dwellings. Rahamathullah Sahib, 
  the leader of the community, asserts that the police performed this act of arson 
  at the behest of the influential Buddhist priest at the Uppuveli Vihara. The 
  displaced persons had continued to live as refugees in two sheds in Love Lane 
  partitioned by polythene paper. They insist that they would go nowhere else 
  except where they were chased from. </p>
<p>A second blow came when President Premadasa came in January 1993 to hold the 
  mobile Presidential Secretariat and the Buddhist monk requested and received 
  from the President &frac34; acre of land in the same area that has so far remained 
  idle according to the refugees.</p>
<p>Following the election of the new government in 1994, the refugees have taken 
  up the matter with Mr.M.H.M. Ashraff, Minister for Ports and Rehabilitation, 
  Deputy Minister Hisbullah and Mr. Najeeb, MP. All of them promised to resolve 
  the matter, but had proved powerless. The worst came when recently the National 
  Housing Development Authority(NHDA) began supplying materials for the construction 
  of 30 houses for Sinhalese on the land where the Muslims had lived. The local 
  head of the NHDA told the Muslim refugees that 'there had been orders from above'. 
  When they approached the AGA(DS) Trincomalee Town and Gravets, he told them 
  that he was powerless to do anything in the matter. </p>
<p>The problem was later put to a number of Sinhalese residents who were present 
  at a local peace meeting. The response received was that the Muslims were making 
  a bogus claim because the Uppuveli Buddhist monk had produced a title deed to 
  that land. This also gives an insight into their psychology of beleaguerdness. 
  It had not occurred to them to question the ethics of dealing with the Muslims 
  in this manner, leave alone by a Buddhist monk. Further if the monk had a genuine 
  legal claim, and with the apparatus of the state behind him, he could easily 
  have dealt with it through the courts in a humane manner.</p>
<p>A similar case is that of Mattikali which housed Sri Shanmuga Boys' Home until 
  the disturbances of 1983. Then Sinhalese encroachers moved in. A Land Officer, 
  T.D. Pieris, tried to regularise these by producing a deed showing that the 
  land belonged to the nearby Jayasumanarama Buddhist temple. This move was dropped 
  after other Tamils produced old deeds to establish Pieris' document to be a 
  forgery. (More on forgeries in the sequel.) But many Sinhalese continue to insist 
  that the land is as described in the forgery.<a href="#a">[Top]</a></p>
<h3><a name="_Toc515698021">2. Linganagar</a></h3>
<p>Mr. T.D. Pieris the Land Officer was shot dead by an unknown gunman on 17th 
  September 1996. Among his last major acts was to issue eviction orders to squatters 
  at Linganagar who were recently placed there by the Tamil militant group, the 
  EPDP, whose 10 MPs support the Government in Parliament. The Defence Ministry 
  was claiming that the land was the property of the Army. The LTTE is generally 
  ruled out since the assassin is said to have watched Pieris' home in town for 
  some days and Pieris regularly visited rural parts of Trincomalee where the 
  LTTE had greater access. Although the Tamils had long looked upon his activities 
  with alarm, there is no suggestion that he was ever an LTTE target. Although 
  the killer has not been identified and evidence is lacking, suspicion remains 
  focused on the EPDP. </p>
<p>The 'Sunday Island' of 29th September 1996 carried a feature article titled 
  'The murder of a land officer'. It was a compendium of claims and suggestions 
  gathered by interviewing officials and a former UNP minister, Gamini Jayasuriya 
  - all Sinhalese with seemingly a similar mind-set. What follows is the essence 
  of the feature. An official was quoted as saying that Linga Nagar is situated 
  on a 47 acre plot of land belonging to the Sri Lankan Army, that was given by 
  the UNP government to build a firing range.</p>
<p>Officials were further quoted as saying that the authorities had decided to 
  relocate the people in Linga Nagar elsewhere because the LTTE could use it to 
  threaten the naval dockyard, Plantain Point SLA detachment, the SLAF base and 
  the Trincomalee harbour.</p>
<p>A survey conducted by Pieris had found that only 31 of the 177 Tamil families 
  at Linga Nagar had been displaced by the war. The rest it was claimed had been 
  'brought from all parts of the country'. There was a fear, it was claimed, that 
  the group behind the settlement 'was planning to intensify its activities'.</p>
<p>Gamini Jayasuriya claimed that there was a well organised campaign to cripple 
  civil administration in Trincomalee, one among whose objectives was to settle 
  a large number of so-called Tamil refugees around Trincomalee town.</p>
<p>We shall now give the truth as best as we are able to piece together.<a href="#a">[Top]</a></p>
<h3><a name="_Toc515698022">The story of Linga Nagar</a></h3>
<p>Linga Nagar is situated north of Trincomalee town. Travelling north on the 
  main road leaving town on the inner (western) side of the isthmus one finds 
  Cottiar Bay to the left, first the Inner Harbour, and then a promontory known 
  as Orr's Hill also to the left going into the bay. The nearer part of Orr's 
  Hill has offices of the NE Provincial Administration, then what is now a crowded 
  residential area and lastly a wide extent of land occupied by Plantain Point 
  army camp. The road then passes Jayasumanarama temple on the left, then Yard 
  Cove (a lagoon inlet) on the left with Mattikali on the right and then a promontory 
  on the left, the nearer part of which is Linga Nagar. Further down the road 
  is another Tamil village known as Palaiyootru.</p>
<p>Linga Nagar consists in part of the old village close to the main road with 
  more than 150 families which existed prior to 1970. By the 1980s there were 
  more than another 100 squatter families living on crown and private lands further 
  interior into the promontory. In 1989 the Ministry of Lands called all encroachers 
  on crown lands throughout the country to register themselves with a view to 
  regularisation if the land concerned was unused crown land not ear-marked for 
  other purposes. A circular further said that no regularisation was to be done 
  after 27.10.89. Some families on crown land at Linga Nagar registered themselves 
  and obtained LDO permits.</p>
<p>In early 1990 the Indian Army was in the process of withdrawing and the LTTE 
  which had close dealings with the UNP government of President Premadasa moved 
  into Trincomalee. A number of youths from Linga Nagar quite imprudently identified 
  with the LTTE and appeared to enjoy a spell of authority. In a multi-ethnic 
  context where the Sri Lankan forces too had a large presence, they were warily 
  observed, marked and the SL forces awaited their chance. This came in June 1990 
  when the LTTE massacred policemen, started a war and pulled out of towns in 
  the East. Several people of Linga Nagar in the category above, or who had moved 
  with the Indian Army, were among the 870 or so persons in the district picked 
  up by the Sri Lankan forces without great finesse or discrimination, and eliminated 
  in death orgies at Plantain Point among other places. [Reports 10, 11 &amp; 
  12.]</p>
<p>Once more large numbers fled as refugees. In 1992 there were 14 families with 
  LDO permits living in what was earlier crown land in Linga Nagar. It is this 
  land that is the subject of controversy. The older part of the village with 
  its school and temple carries on much as before with many of the refugees having 
  returned.</p>
<p>Plantain Point Army Camp and Claims on Linga Nagar</p>
<p>The story now goes back in time. Plantain Point, at the further end of Orr's 
  Hill was earlier used by the British Admiralty and remained abandoned when they 
  pulled out in 1958. The area turned to shrub jungle and came to be occupied 
  by Tamil squatters. In 1975 a land officer named Jayasuriya who was in the Volunteer 
  Force moved to get the Sri Lankan Army to take over the area. He went in and 
  unceremoniously evicted the residents overnight. The action was grossly discriminatory 
  and unprecedented in the treatment of squatters. It was the time when estates 
  in the South were being taken over by the government and much land was being 
  given to Sinhalese peasants.</p>
<p>Tissa Devendra who was government agent at that time, it is reported, was unhappy 
  with the move, and had left the station to dissociate himself from it and at 
  the same time to avoid confronting the Army.</p>
<p>While the original camp was a small one at the edge of the promontory, the 
  new one was greatly enlarged with the boundary moved several furlongs eastwards 
  towards the main road. The lands on Orr's Hill including what was taken over 
  by the British Admiralty during the last war were private lands. The British 
  Admiralty tried to trace the owners with a view to returning the lands as they 
  pulled out in 1958. Being unable to do so and the owners not showing much interest 
  then since land prices were low at that time, the lands were left as crown lands 
  by the Admiralty.</p>
<p>About 1978 or 1979 the Army at Plantain Point made a request for 6 chains (132 
  yards) of land to be measured from the tip of the adjacent promontory containing 
  Linga Nagar to be used as a demolition ground. The land was measured and marked 
  off by the Kacheri Surveyor for Town and Gravets, Mutur, Kinniya, Kuchchaveli 
  and Thampalakamam. The extent of land was 1.9 acres, but it was never taken 
  over by the Army(see map). At this time T.D. Pieris was Kacheri Surveyor for 
  the remaining divisions of Trincomalee:- viz. Kantalai, Seruvila and Gomarankadawela.</p>
<p>In 1982 T.D.Pieris was interdicted by the chairman of the District Development 
  Council(DDC) elected in 1981 for allegedly having taken a bribe of Rs.500/- 
  from a lady for the issue of a land deed. Such remained constant complaints 
  against Pieris throughout his career. With the communal violence of July 1983, 
  the last vestiges of the DDCs - that were advanced as a solution to the ethnic 
  problem - collapsed. Under Camillus Fernando as GA, Pieris was returned to his 
  position. It was a time of confusion and what sort of inquiry was held, if there 
  was one, is not clear. Following the retirement of the Kacheri Surveyor covering 
  Town &amp; Gravets, Kinniya, Mutur, Thampalakamam &amp; Kuchchaveli, Pieris 
  was given charge of the whole district and was later promoted to Land Officer. 
</p>
<p>It was after the collapse of the North-East Provincial Council under the Indo-Lanka 
  Accord, and the onset of the war in June 1990 that Pieris' hand was felt in 
  a big way. His small-time jobs consisted of taking money, getting clerks to 
  fill up LDO (Land Development Ordinance) forms, and forging the signatures of 
  former land officers. The Army and the Administration found him useful in identifying 
  lands around Trincomalee to settle Sinhalese, exclude Tamils and Muslims or 
  to plant some state body such as the Army.</p>

  Sketch of Pieris' map produced in 1992 </p>
<p><br>
  In 1992 T.D. Pieris produced a map (map 2 above) which showed 47 acres east 
  of the ridge as belonging to the Army and another piece of land as vested with 
  the Ports Authority. The Army command at Plantain Point under Brigadier Siri 
  Pieris made an insistent claim that they needed the land for a firing range. 
  Had the land been measured from the edge of the promontory, taking a natural 
  slice of it with the boundary running north-west, instead of north-east through 
  the middle, Linga Nagar would have been excluded. But the lands claimed by the 
  Army and supposedly vested with the SLPA were so placed as to take over much 
  of Linga Nagar. It was claimed that the transfer had been effected in 1979.</p>
<p>Confronting the Army in Trincomalee was then considered a dangerous thing to 
  do. But several officials challenged this claim. This also brought the claims 
  of the Army in conflict with the actions of A.Thangarajah, Additional Land Commissioner 
  for the North - East, who earlier as a land officer in 1989 had issued LDO permits 
  to encroachers on land which the Army claimed had already been their property. 
  Thangarajah had acted according to a government decision at that time as already 
  explained. </p>
<p>Major General Nalin Seneviratne, Governor of the North-East Province, appointed 
  a 3 member commission that could not report because the chairman Markandu was 
  transferred to Colombo and A.Thangarajah resigned because the propriety of his 
  own action was in question. The Governor then appointed a second commission 
  chaired by Mr. Velayuthapillai with two other Sinhalese officers. The commission 
  report found the claims of T.D. Pieris and the Army inconsistent and badly wanting. 
  T.D.Pieris and an army officer who was earlier Lieutenant Tikiri Banda told 
  the commission that the hand-over of 47 acres shown had been done in 1979 on 
  behalf of the administration by T.D. Pieris and Tikiri Banda had accepted on 
  behalf of the Army. The following are some salient features of the case. </p>
<p>(i) No record of procedure such as: Request by the Army for land stating extent 
  and purpose, record of survey, request by GA to the Land Commissioner for authority 
  to transfer crown land, gazette notification, and documents of transfer. In 
  particular, there is no gazette notification of the land transfer.<br>
  (ii) The transfer was claimed as having been done to the 22nd Brigade of the 
  SLA in 1979. But the 22nd Brigade was formed only in the late 80s.<br>
  (iii) The SLPA could not in 1979 have possessed the land shown in the map as 
  belonging to it. Land acquisitions by the SLPA were not gazetted until the early 
  80s. No record of any request for the land by SLPA.<br>
  (iv) T.D. Pieris could not have done the transfer in 1979 as his duties then 
  did not cover Town and Gravets. A more senior surveyor covered the latter area 
  and there was no reason to call upon Pieris, a junior officer, to do the transfer.</p>
<p>There is another little known fact. While the controversy was going on General 
  Nalin Seneviratne wrote to the Army asking them to shift the firing range to 
  some other suitable rural location. Being an experienced military man he considered 
  the suburban setting in Linga Nagar inappropriate for the purpose - and even 
  more so in the location nearer the main road chosen by Pieris.</p>
<p>It was clear that the acquisition had nothing to do with any military purpose. 
  The motivations were ideological. The map and the claims were fraudulent. Although 
  the Army did not subsequently press its earlier claim, it did not drop the demand 
  and the matter remains unresolved. It is also very much a reflection of the 
  degree of ethnic polarisation within the administration and the absence of professionalism 
  that the report of the commission on the lines above was submitted by the chairman, 
  with the two Sinhalese members refusing to sign in the matter of what was an 
  open and shut case.</p>
<p>But T.D. Pieris' presence became an embarrassment and even a nuisance in the 
  administration of Trincomalee and during 1993 the Government Agent Mr. Godawela 
  called for his removal and a transfer order was given by the Ministry of Lands. 
  According to prominent local sources Brigadier Siri Pieris and the Defence Ministry 
  successfully lobbied to retain him in Trincomalee on the grounds that his services 
  were invaluable to them. T.D. Pieris remained in Trincomalee but was thereafter 
  not taken very seriously. He continued to do the small-time jobs for which he 
  was well-known. We also reliably understand that in the Land office of the Trincomalee 
  Kacheri, LDO permits held by non-Sinhalese were picked up from stacks, a small 
  number at a time, and destroyed on a regular basis. It was in the wake of EPDP 
  activities that Pieris managed to revive the Army's interest in taking over 
  Linga Nagar. </p>
<p>This time apart from the old claim that the 47 acres of land belonged to the 
  Army, security reasons were being advanced (Shamindra Fernando's report cited 
  above) and the officials are quoted as denying charges that they intend settling 
  Sinhalese on the land. Both these deserve comment. In terms of proximity, Linga 
  Nagar is further away from security installations than other Tamil residential 
  areas. Orr's Hill in fact adjoins Plantain Point camp. If one goes on the basis 
  that any Tamil residential area is a security threat, this line of reasoning 
  would lead to herding all Tamils into fenced and guarded 'welfare centres' such 
  as obtain in Vavuniya. What would then be the country's fate?</p>
<p>The claim of having no intention of settling Sinhalese is again disingenuous. 
  Going by past experience, some junior army officer or local official has only 
  to give a signal and encroachment would be guaranteed. The authorities have 
  no record of ever taking action against Sinhalese encroachers unlike the third 
  degree methods used against other communities. </p>
<p>It may also be asked why the Army made such a flimsy case for the Linga Nagar 
  land that was full of gaping holes? The short answer is that they expected little 
  active opposition. There are many officials retired and in service who are familiar 
  with the original history of the case, the actual request in 1979 for 6 chains 
  of land and what happened thereafter. But they remain reluctant to testify in 
  public or have their names quoted. Trincomalee has a particular history and 
  there is real fear that once you are marked, anything could happen. Something 
  did happen to one official who was mixed up in the Linga Nagar case. This will 
  be taken up below.<a href="#a">[Top]</a></p>
<h3><br>
  <a name="_Toc515698023">EPDP's Activities &amp; its Antecedents</a></h3>
<p>Through a fluke of history the EPDP got ten MPs into parliament from the Jaffna 
  District with as few as 5 votes from some electorates. It had been allied to 
  the last UNP government and its cadre had been posted in Jaffna's offshore islands 
  which had the bulk of the effective voters in the district, since the vast majority 
  of voters who were then under LTTE control could not vote. The EPDP also effectively 
  prevented other Tamil parties from campaigning in the islands. The elections 
  were technically held and the EPDP got its reward. Thereafter it switched sides 
  to support the newly elected PA government in parliament. This was the source 
  of its influence. The EPDP did not have a reputation for being so unruly or 
  heavy handed as, say, the PLOTE or TELO. </p>
<p>In November 1994 , following the last elections, an incident revealed something 
  of the EPDP's inner nature. One of its cadre Udaya Sooriyakumar who is said 
  to have been wanting to leave the movement was found dead with 17 stab injuries 
  on the Wellawatte beach on the morning of 15th November 1994.. A report in the 
  Observer of 13/11/94 by P.Senanayake &amp; J.Jayasinghe said that acting on 
  an anonymous call two members of the EPDP, including the organiser for Trincomalee, 
  were detained and questioned about this killing. They had revealed that the 
  deceased had been abducted on 1/11/94 for leaving the organisation without notice 
  and detained at the EPDP's head quarters then at Park Road, Havelock Town. On 
  the evening of 14/11/94 he was taken in an EPDP jeep to the beach where he was 
  murdered. The EPDP hierarchy was clearly implicated, and according to the Observer 
  of Sunday 27/11/94, the police searched the EPDP HQ following the organisations 
  failure to hand over three suspects. Nothing remarkable came out of these investigations. 
  The EPDP's MPs were already supporting the Government in parliament. The support 
  was no doubt more firm after the investigations. </p>
<p>With the breakdown of any rational administrative policy or outlook it is the 
  general rule throughout the country that the distribution of state resources 
  depended overwhelmingly on the political patronage of the government in power. 
  As the last president D.B. Wijetunge put it crudely, it was the government that 
  ladled out the rice from the bowl. The message was that those who voted for 
  the opposition would suffer. The Tamils in the East who lived in a multi-ethnic 
  environment saw themselves as having suffered heavily through being in the opposition 
  most of the time. Tamils, even nationalists, in the Amparai District who now 
  have no representation, feel that the benefits that had accrued to them by their 
  former TULF MP Kanagaratnam crossing over to the UNP government had been crucial 
  to their survival. Today all four Tamil MPs including the one from the Trincomalee 
  District support the government in parliament. The means by which state resources 
  are distributed has also consolidated a populist political culture where the 
  MP gets the credit for resources brought to the area. The EPDP is largely prevented 
  by security considerations from working among its own constituents in Jaffna. 
  On the other hand Trincomalee town and suburbs which are considered fairly secure 
  have become a hub of activity for all militant groups opposed to the LTTE. But 
  the EPDP has few resources to build up its image in Trincomalee since the local 
  Tamil MP is from the TULF which supports the government. Given the large refugee 
  population in Trincomalee, the EPDP resorted to another brand of populism where 
  the lack or resources did not pose a big problem. What it did was to call applications 
  for land in Trincomalee town from refugees who were nearly all from the rural 
  villages. It then blocked out 6 to 8 perches of land for a family from two blocks 
  of land. One was the contentious crown land in Linga Nagar, and the other was 
  the 30 acre plot purchased by the Tamil University Movement near 3rd Mile Post 
  on the Nilaveli Road. The move was both short sighted and had serious inherent 
  limitations. Other residents pointed out that the land belonging to the Tamil 
  University Movement could have been used for an educational or cultural purpose 
  at an appropriate time in the future. The trustees of this land were at present 
  not contesting the move by the EPDP. The fact that it is an armed militant group 
  that currently enjoyed some influence with the State is something that would 
  cross anyone's mind.</p>
<p>In the case of Linga Nagar the EPDP's move to settle people on the land provided 
  opportunity to T.D.Pieris who had largely ceased to be taken seriously. Once 
  again publicity was loudly voiced to the effect that there was a sinister move 
  to settle Tamils on land that belonged to the Army. The Army too began voicing 
  its claim which it had not taken seriously for some time. Under Pieris moves 
  were set in motion to evict the squatters. It was agaist this backdrop that 
  Pieris was shot dead on 17th September. Then cries of foul play by sinister 
  Tamil forces became even more strident with the ultra-nationalist sections of 
  the press, Buddhist monks and members of the elite in Colombo getting into the 
  act. There were calls to disarm the Tamil militant groups opposed to the LTTE. 
  It is a measure of the influence commanded by the EPDP's parliamentary support 
  to the government that in Trincomalee the PLOTE was disarmed for a time. Indeed 
  the PLOTE was notorious for killings in Vavuniya town for which no serious action 
  had been taken. It's three MPs from Vavuniya too supported the government in 
  parliament. But any suspicion that the PLOTE was responsible for the killing 
  of T.D. Pieris in Trincomalee was extremely remote. </p>
<p>Prior to the temporary disarming of the PLOTE there were demonstrations in 
  the market area on 10th October 1996. This was preceded by a drama that is not 
  widely known and the potential danger it portended should not be underestimated 
  when taken in conjunction with the volatile political climate in the South. 
  During early October there was a meeting in the suburban Sinhalese settlement 
  of Sirimapura which is the home of some rougher elements with interests in the 
  market and associated with leading communal violence in the past with the co-operation 
  of the security forces. Those considered friendly to the Tamils were excluded 
  from the meeting that was also attended by some Buddhist monks. The issues of 
  T.D.Pieris' murder and of a police sub-inspector were discussed. The dominant 
  sentiment was that the Sinhalese interests were being threatened and that they 
  could no longer take things lying down. Emotions were running high.</p>
<p>A prominent Tamil citizen was informed by a Sinhalese resident that there were 
  plans afoot to spark off communal violence. This was communicated to the TULF 
  general secretary in Colombo and preventive measures were taken. It also turned 
  out that a number of Sinhalese had urgently communicated the danger to their 
  Tamil contacts. This is again suggestive of a strong interest in avoiding violence.</p>
<p>The demonstration which began in the market and moved to the EPDP office passed 
  off without much incident. Muslims and Tamils in the market area too had little 
  choice but to participate in the protest for the fear of displeasing the rough 
  Sinhalese elements. The press in Colombo reported this as a broad-based protest 
  against the armed Tamil militant groups.</p>
<p>What happened then was that the Army became insistant on taking over the Linganagar 
  land. The EPDP which was crucially dependant on the Army at one level could 
  not go far in confronting the Army. Thus the logical thing for the EPDP to do 
  was to slowly wash its hands off the Linganagar matter alltogether. The Army 
  which regarded T.D.Pieris as their man and was convinced that the EPDP had done 
  the killing was prevented from getting at the EPDP because of its influence 
  with the government and the lack of any evidence. So they were demanding their 
  pound of flesh by getting at the people who were not EPDP supporters, but had 
  simply wanted land. It was again the old logic of reprisal action against the 
  people after the attackers were safely beyond reach .</p>
<p>In the case of theTamil University land too, once some kind of peace returns, 
  the board of trustees of the Tamil University Movement is bound to file court 
  action and the people will have to leave the land. In either case, the EPDP's 
  populism is bound to leave the people in the lurch and worse off than what they 
  would have been. </p>
<p>The people concerned are those from villages in the district and feel that 
  there are too many uncertainties for them to go back. Any solution to their 
  problem needs to take into account their well-being and economic viability in 
  the long term. Perhaps the most serious criticism of the EPDP's action is that 
  it was using these people to score a point in the same manner that the Army 
  plants Sinhalese peasants along the roadsides in insecure areas.</p>
<p><br>
  Mr. Chandradasa, the present Government Agent, has a reputation for having sympathy 
  for the down -trodden with a sincere diapproval of violence. While serving as 
  AGA in Seruvila some years ago, he had worked hard at helping the neglected 
  Tamil peasants in Ichchilampattai. </p>
<p><br>
  Even while T.D.Pieris was trying to raise alarm in circles of power about the 
  EPDP settling squatters in Linga Nagar, Chandradasa did not take sides. But 
  once Pieris was killed, he had reportedly become coloured by the view that the 
  settlers were EPDP supporters and that the killing was a threat to the administration. 
  But on the market issue reported below, Chandradasa had voiced the view that 
  the Army was in the wrong.<a href="#a">[Top]</a></p>

<p>A letter dated 5th January was sent to the Chairman of the Trincomalee Urban 
  Council by Brigadier P.S.B.Kulatunge RSP USP, Commander 22nd Brigade and Co-ordinating 
  Officer, TCO South. The letter contained the following unusual statement: &quot; 
  The decision to cancel the tender after our discussion, as you know, was made 
  due to the deterioriating situation in the area, and in the general interest 
  of the public in Trincomalee&quot;.</p>
<p>The letter further added a note of warning, &quot;Your hasty decision to allow 
  the tenderer to collect the rent at the vegetable market as from 4th January 
  1997, would further aggravate the security situation, and hence I would like 
  you to abide by my earlier decision for the UC employees to collect the rent 
  from the vegetable market.&quot; </p>
<p>The foregoing would suggest a most singular drama considering what was involved 
  was simply the Trincomalee market being given out on tender with all the rules 
  followed to the letter. </p>
<p>The facts in short are these. The Trincomalee market was dominated by Sinhalese 
  traders. The Tamils who were the majority in town, generally did not show much 
  interest in this line of business. The influence of some Sinhalese merchants 
  rose sharply with state patronage, the backing of the security forces and the 
  advent of communal violence from 1977. Their power was greatly reduced when 
  the Indian Peace Keeping Force arrived. From June 1990 however, the market was 
  under the control of an influential Sinhalese agent who got control of the market 
  for Rs 300, 000/= a year with no competition offered. </p>
<p>In November 1996 the chairman of the Urban Council decided to call for tenders 
  and set the minimum at Rs500,000. His contention was that the Council needed 
  the money and moreover business had picked up in recent years. Jayaratne, the 
  man who originally controlled the market objected to the new minimum set and 
  did not tender for the market. This being the situation the tender period was 
  extended at the request of the Brigadier. Only one person, Kennedy, tendered, 
  who also happened to belong to the militant group PLOTE. This is understandable 
  since only a Tamil person with such a background could hope to stand up to those 
  who had hitherto controlled the market and wielded considerable intimidatory 
  power. Kennedy was awarded the tender. A protest was organised by the supporters 
  of Jayaratne on 17th December 1996 which closed most of the shops in Trincomalee 
  and public and private transport too was brought to a standstill as Sinhalese 
  operators dominated these sectors as well. It was clear that these sections 
  were using the power they had enjoyed with the blessings of the Sinhalese dominated 
  security forces, to prevent the law from taking its course. Buddhist priests 
  too joined in the protest against the award of the tender to a Tamil man. It 
  reflected arm twisting by interests that had been increasingly asserting themselves 
  in Trincomalee for the last few decades. </p>
<p>The Brigadier in charge of Trincomalee intervened using his emergency powers 
  to cancel the tender, but the Chairman of the Urban Council stood his ground. 
  Following a meeting with the Brigadier on 26th December the Chairman agreed 
  as an interim measure for employees of the Urban Council to collect the rent 
  from the market stall holders. The Brigadier in turn promised police assistance 
  to the Urban Council officers who went to collect the rent. But no such police 
  assistance was forthcoming and the UC chairman decided to allow the tenderer 
  to collect the rent. The tenderer too proved unsuccessful. Up to the time of 
  writing the UC had not collected any rent from the market. The 'Sunday Island' 
  of 26th January 1997 carried a feature by Namini Wijedasa which gave an impartial 
  report on the situation based on interviewing Mr. Sooriyamoorthy, chairman of 
  the Urban Council and some of the Sinhalese traders. In comparison with the 
  protest on 17th December new reasons were being adduced such as a threat to 
  the Sinhalese, plans to shift the market to a Tamil area and so on. The report 
  also added that the Tamil and Muslim traders refused to comment and concluded 
  that the truth of the matter may have evaded the writer. </p>
<p>According to the Tamil residents the Brigadier's action demonstrated that laws 
  in this country are applicable only to the minorities. They added that the Tamil 
  and Muslim traders in the market had to do as they were told by the former Sinhalese 
  bosses, as given their experience in the past, they feared being marked and 
  something unpleasant happening later on. The 'Island' of 27th January carried 
  an editorial referring to the Trincomalee market sitting on a powder keg and 
  calling for the situation to be defused. Eighteen years ago in 1979, the 'Financial 
  Times' of London carried a Survey on Sri Lanka where the lead item was headlined, 
  &quot;Sri Lanka sits on a powder keg&quot;. This country went happily living 
  out the prophecy over the next few years with the burning of the Jaffna Public 
  Library, communal violence and then precipitating a war. Neither the press nor 
  the ruling establishment ever seemed to take all this seriously, and now we 
  seem to have discovered that Trincomalee market is sitting on a powder keg! 
  Indeed, the situation must be defused. But we seem to be going through a certain 
  kind of warped reasoning again and again. Where it is an issue where the law 
  appears to place the minority in an advantageous position a grave crisis and 
  a threat to peace are discovered and used as an argument to deprive the members 
  of the minority. A similar argument was used to introduce a very unfair system 
  of standardisation of university admissions in 1971, which by lowering the marks 
  for Sinhalese candidates gave the advantage overwhelmingly to privileged Sinhalese 
  students in the best schools. [Originally preference was based on purely linguistic 
  criteria. The district quota system was introduced some years later.] <a href="#a">[Top]</a></p>
<h3><a name="_Toc515698025">The Administration : the cost of being effective and 
  belonging to the wrong community</a></h3>
<p>Given below is the fate of a Tamil officer who exercised initiative and whose 
  services were uniformly commended. His recent penalisation is linked in particular 
  to two land matters. One of them is Linga Nagar:</p>
<p>At the time he reached 55 on 10th February 1995, A. Thangarajah had worked 
  20 years in the Administrative Service, having earlier worked as a teacher, 
  also in government service. A number of others with his experience had reached 
  the top. But what happened to Thangarajah was very unusual. On reaching 55 (the 
  age of optional retirement) while he was AGA(DS) Mutur, he was told that he 
  should go on retirement. Upon application it is practically routine for SLAS 
  officers to be given extensions until they reach 60 (age of compulsory retirement). 
</p>
<p>In 1980 the officer was punished while serving as AGA Vaharai by having to 
  spend 40 months on no pay, losing several increments and his seniority. He had 
  then refused to register a Rural Development Society where the president and 
  secretary were UNP minister Devanayagam's men who were resident in Valaichenai. 
  The inquiring officer had found no charge to be valid. The officer who should 
  have reached Class I in 1992 retired at Class II -Grade 2. His deferred promotion 
  to II-1 due in 1993 was not given and is still on appeal.</p>
<p>Thangarajah came to Trincomalee in 1983 as a land officer covering the mainly 
  Tamil and Muslim AGA divisions of Town and Gravets, Kinniya, Mutur and Kuchchaveli. 
  Up to 1990 he had strictly followed government regulations and circulars in 
  issuing 17000 Land Development Ordinance permits in these divisions. Working 
  hard for the people on land matters was no doubt undesirable from the point 
  of State ideology. He was never faulted on his work, except that later in 1992, 
  his issue of 14 LDO permits on land in Linga Nagar to which the Army subsequently 
  made a claim was advanced in certain quarters as unlawful and conspiratorial.</p>
<p>In 1990 Thangarajah was appointed Additional Land Commissioner for the North-East 
  under the NE provincial administration. Acting within his powers under the 13th 
  Amendment to the constitution, his administration issued more than 2000 LDO 
  permits mainly in the Mannar and Kilinochchi districts and appointed 40 land 
  officers and assistant land commissioners to expedite land work.</p>
<p>He was made AGA (DS) Mutur in early1993. In all matters under his purview, 
  he used his powers to the full and ensured that the people received the best 
  possible benefit. As DS Mutur he spent all the money allocated for public works 
  at the rate of about Rs 78 million a year without returning any to the treasury. 
  Of about 50 projects allocated to Mutur under 15,000 Village Level Projects, 
  he saw that the work was completed.</p>
<p>When floods came to Mutur in December 1993, his work in flood relief was commended 
  by the co-ordinating officer Brigadier Siri Pieris. Once the brigadier's commendation 
  came, the excess Rs 3.9 million spent above the 0.5 million allocated, about 
  which questions were being raised, was expeditiously settled. </p>
<p>Thangarajah made an application to the Ministry of Public Administration (MPA) 
  for the first one year's extension from 11.2.95 about August 1994.</p>
<p>On 13th February 1995 he received a letter from the ministry informing him 
  that he should go on retirement. Thangarajah appealed to the Public Services 
  Commission on 14th February, the following day. He found that his application 
  had not been recommended by Mr. Chandradasa who was appointed Government Agent 
  in late 1994 after the election of the new government. The grounds for not recommending 
  were said to be some petitions against him. Thangarajah stated in his appeal 
  that Chandreadasa who was only familiar with his work for a very short period 
  could not be a suitable referee and that Mr.Godawela, the former GA, would be 
  the right person. Godawela later confirmed that he had recommended Thangaraja. 
  The PSC approved his extension and informed the MPA. After a long delay of 18 
  months that included the MPA asking for Thangarajah's birth certificate which 
  they said was not in the file, Thangarajah received his approval from the MPA 
  on 11 th November 1996, by when even the period for his second year's extension 
  had almost expired. He sent his second appeal to the PSC the following day on 
  14.11.96 and at the time of writing this report he had been out of work for 
  24 months and was yet to receive a response. But it is learnt that the PSC had 
  hand-delivered its approval to the MPA on 7/2/97. The matter had been raised 
  by a number of persons including a local MP. Ratnasiri Wickremanayake, the minister 
  of public administration is understood to have said that the officer had been 
  treated unfairly. </p>
<p>It is widely understoodthat what is held against Thangarajah is in particular 
  his issue of 14 LDO permits in Linga Nagar in 1989. Another that surfaced after 
  Chandradasa became GA is the issue of Sinhalese squatters who had lived near 
  the Mutur jetty. Some time after June 1990 the Army put them into occupation 
  of public land in town designated for a bank and the telecommunication centre, 
  and were helping them. Moves to regularise the encroachment in 1993 were dropped 
  following protests, including by Mr. M.H.M Ashraff, now a minister in the present 
  government. Chandradasa took up the matter again and wanted Thangaraja as DS, 
  Muthur, to regularise the encroachment. This Thangarajah refused as he had refused 
  Minister Devanayagam in 1980. In Thangaraja's case one could think only of utter 
  inefficiency, or the cabal applying the unwritten rules of the public service, 
  knowing what they want. Either way the state of the administration bodes ill 
  for the credibility of any political settlement. </p>
<p>The new PA government in late 1994 called for appeals from those who had suffered 
  political victimisation under the previous UNP government of 1977-94. Thangarajah's 
  case is expected to receive a positive response. In the meantime his treatment 
  by the new government was hardly an improvement.<a href="#a">[Top]</a></p>
<h3><br>
  <a name="_Toc515698026">At the highest level</a></h3>
<p>In what is again a very unusual development, both the Linga Nagar matter and 
  the Trincomalee market affair were brought to the president for her resolution. 
  Both these matters are governed by clear rules laid down in the law and should 
  have been disposed of at a much lower level. These should never have been brought 
  to the president whose job was quite something else. The fact that these matters 
  came to her is again a symptom that rules had ceased to apply in the ramshackle 
  state machine worn down by decades of misuse. </p>
<p>The parties to the market dispute had been invited to the presidential secretariat 
  for a discussion. The TULF MP for Trinco District met the president at the end 
  of January, showed her T.D. Pieris' map of Linga Nagar and explained the facts 
  to her with the findings of the governor's commission. The president immediately 
  saw through the issue and asked the MP to discuss the matter with defence ministry 
  officials. The latter stood by their claim to 47 acres of land. The MP asked 
  the defence officials to show when and where they had shown cause and asked 
  for land in Linga Nagar, and how they arrived at the magic figure of 47 acres, 
  except for the fact that it surfaced in the claim faked by T.D. Pieris. Later 
  the defence officials modified their claim to 47 acres, that were to be measured 
  from the edge of the promontory. There were even later suggestions that some 
  officials dissatisfied that Linga Nagar would be largely left untouched, had 
  wanted 30 acres of SLPA land (again a fiction from Pieris' map) to be first 
  marked off from the edge of the promontory before measuring 47 acres for the 
  Army. The matter is bound to drag on and probably go back to the president again.</p>
<p>Had an ordinary member of the public made the kind of claim in a court of law 
  that the defence ministry was making on the basis of Pieris' map, he would have 
  been found guilty of fraud, perjury and forgery. By right the president should 
  have severely reprimanded the officials concerned as persons who ought to set 
  a better example and even have demoted some of them as unfit to represent the 
  country with honour at its highest levels. By not doing so, she had chosen to 
  appease the defence ministry, thus adding to her problems. We also get a fair 
  idea of why cases of violations by security personnel under this government 
  either continue to get covered up, or even where arrests are made, the accused 
  are bailed out with the trial indefinitely delayed.</p>
<p>The murder of T.D. Pieris was a crime against an individual who was also an 
  officer of the State. But would such a crime in a Sinhalese area have sent the 
  Army hell-bent on acquiring land in the area to punish residents, as at Linga 
  Nagar, who were not party to the crime? The Linga Nagar and the market issue 
  further confirm what has long been said about the inner motivations of the Army 
  and the Defence Ministry. They perceive themselves as Sinhalese state institutions 
  furthering a communal state ideology. By standing his ground and calling the 
  brigadier's bluff on the market issue, the chairman of the Trincomalee Urban 
  Council has exposed State ideology at its silliest and most ridiculous. It also 
  aptly sums up Sri Lanka's post-independence political legacy as communal politics 
  of the fish and vegetable market. <a href="#a">[Top]</a></p>
<h3><a name="_Toc515698027">Refugees and Resettlement</a></h3>
<p><i>Sinhalese refugees from Kallara:</i></p>
<p><br>
  Mary Agnes (50) was originally from Thiriyai just south of Kallara. She had 
  belonged to the only Sinhalese family in the farming village of Thiriyai who 
  farmed several acres of paddy land. She had good friends among the Tamils and 
  spoke the language fluently. In 1985 as the conflict intensified her neighbours 
  advised her to leave. She went first to Trinco town and then to live in Kallara 
  with Sinhalese fisherfolk in 1987 after the IPKF arrived. With the onset of 
  war in June 1990 the residents of Kallara fled to Trincomalee town and returned 
  six months later. On 25th May 1995 the LTTE attacked Kallara a month after it 
  broke its cease-fire agreement with the PA government. 46 Sinhalese civilians 
  were killed including a niece of Agnes and the husband of her niece. Agnes now 
  lives with other Sinhalese refugees in Love Lane receiving food rations from 
  the government. The LTTE's claim was put to these refugees that it had attacked 
  the village because these Sinhalese were integral to the armed aggression against 
  Tamils and were so part of the military machine. The refugees responded that 
  they did not work for the Army and hardly saw the LTTE. The only help they gave 
  the Army was that their fishing boats were used to transport vegetables to the 
  Army from Puddavaikkattu and soldiers who were going home on leave. </p>
<p>The presence of Sinhalese fisherfolk in the area goes far back and has been 
  mentioned in the Ceylon Census of 1901. The LTTE's actions have forced isolated 
  Sinhalese and Muslim communities to depend on the Sri Lankan Army for their 
  protection. The choice was not theirs. Several of the men among the refugees 
  now work for fishing boat owners in the area.<a href="#a">[Top]</a></p>
<h3><br>
  <a name="_Toc515698028">Refugees: General</a></h3>
<p>A key problem presently facing refugees from the Tamil villages of Trincomalee 
  is that they are scattered in several camps or in small communities around Trincomalee 
  town, in Mullaitivu District and further afield such as Mannar Mainland(Madhu), 
  Mannar Island(Pesalai) and India. </p>
<p>The camp at Alles Garden near Trincomalee town was built by the UNHCR and is 
  now administered by the Trincomalee Kachcheri . All refugees who are not resettled 
  are provided rations by rehabilitation ministry. Nilaveli, still has a refugee 
  camp at the Roman Catholic church where the refugees came mainly from the villages 
  further north such as Kuchchaveli and Thiriyai. The difference is that those 
  in Nilaveli, had evacuated after the army arrived in 1990 and harrassed the 
  people, causing some to disappear. The people had then moved towards Trincomalee 
  town for relative safety and some had settled in Nilaveli. Those in the UNHCR 
  camp are generally people who fled into Mullaitivu District before the Army 
  arrived in June 1990, trekked through the jungle to the Mannar coast, were in 
  India as refugees and were brought back by ship to Trincomalee from 1993 under 
  what they took to be a guarantee of their security by UNHCR. The UNHCR camp 
  thus contains people from all parts of the district starting from Pulmoodai, 
  Thiriyai and Kuchavelli in the north, from Kannia and Pankulam to the west of 
  Trincomalee town, and also persons from the Mutur and Kinniya divisions in the 
  south of the district. </p>
<p>Kannia, Pankulam and Thiriyai are at present not under army control., and lie 
  almost totally abandoned. These persons may not be able to go back, unless the 
  LTTE and the security forces agreed to certain norms that would guarantee their 
  safety and reconstruction is made possible. But a number of persons in these 
  camps are from Kuchchaveli which is the last village going north under Army 
  control. Between Kuchchaveli and Pulmoddai is a gap containing Pudavaikkaddu, 
  Thiriyai and Kallara from which the Army pulled out in 1995. Refugees from Kuchchaveli 
  have for some time been asked to return. Some of the factors are that these 
  refugees from Kuchchaveli have found work as employees of fishing boat owners 
  close to town, as labourers or as farm hands around Nilaveli. They receive rations 
  as displaced persons, have some kind of rudimentary housing particularly in 
  the UNHCR camp, and their children have found schools close to the camps. Combined 
  with doubts and uncertainties about going back home, a certain inertia has set 
  in. On the other hand if communication is established between the scattered 
  communities from the same village and they can jointly decide to go back., there 
  would be greater confidence in returning. </p>
<p>The refugees at the Nilaveli Roman Catholic church also related a problem faced 
  by a number of refugee families who did not flee the district in 1990. The Army 
  had come into the Nilaveli church camp on three occasions from July to August 
  1990 and taken away a total of 56 males who are now missing. The families who 
  lost bread winners have been eking out a living supported by government rations. 
  It is not easy for them to contemplate going back to their village and starting 
  life anew, without assurance of further support. Further, entrenched discriminatory 
  practices followed at check points and by the Navy reinforce Tamils in their 
  insecurity. For the refugees in particular these prevent them from developing 
  trust. For example, the Tamil and Muslim fishermen are not allowed to go beyond 
  a certain distance from the shore. But this does not apply to Sinhalese fishermen. 
</p>
<p>Also among the refugees in town are Muslims from Pulmoddai. These people too 
  are scattered with some in Kinnia, some in Puttalam and others in Pulmoddai 
  itself. According to Ahamed Lebbe, the head of sixteen families living in Love 
  Lane, they had come to town in 1990 and went back on foot after two years. But 
  has received little from the rehabilitation ministry besides their rations. 
  There is no direct access to Pulmoddai along the coast. Ahamed Lebbe feels that 
  they may be cheated again and is reluctant to go back without more concrete 
  assurances. </p>
<p>In the case of Puddavai Kaddu the Muslim villagers were even earlier treated 
  with suspicion by the security forces. At the outset of the present bout of 
  war in April 1995, the LTTE attacked soldiers in the area and five civilians 
  were killed, reportedly in reprisals by the Army. The area is now under LTTE 
  control. These refugees feel that they cannot go back until the security forces 
  are firmly in control, owing to the LTTE's ambivalent attitude towards Muslims. 
</p>
<p>The TULF MP was asked for his observations on rehabilitation and to respond 
  to some of the shortcomings that people had complained about. One of the complaints 
  was that the 186 families of estate labour origin who were resettled in Kappalthurai 
  six miles south on the Colombo road are living in dilapidated conditions. The 
  MP admitted that the conditions for resettlement are not ideal and the Rs25,000 
  /= provided for housing by the rehabilitation ministry was inadequate. He pointed 
  out that adjacent to Kappalthurai 50 Muslim families and another group of Sinhalese 
  families were resettled with identical facilities - that is an initial Rs 6,000/= 
  and then the housing grant in stages. The Muslims and Sinhalese he said, had 
  done some gardening and had found some other means to supplement their income. 
  They participated in the self-housing scheme and had put up houses using the 
  Rs 25,000/= from the rehabilitation ministry along with their own money and 
  they are now fairly stable. The Tamils he said had not participated in the self-housing 
  scheme. But they had been given a hospital that is now being built and two school 
  buildings. But they had been slow in finding means of a reasonable income. Although 
  the dry rations would normally have been stopped after they were paid the Rs 
  6,000/=, this facility has been extended. It is therefore not correct, he said, 
  to say that they have been unduly neglected or treated unfairly. </p>
<p>The MP observed that although settling rural refugees in small plots of land 
  around Trincomalee town is welcomed by some, it would on the long run be ruinous 
  for the Tamils. He added, &quot;Most of these people are from the villages and 
  that is where their culture and community life belong. In your village you have 
  your culture, your place of worship, your home garden and you will never starve. 
  In the case of refugees in town their children are in a sorry plight and you 
  could see many of them rootless and becoming undisciplined. <br>
  &quot; It is not fair to say that Trincomalee town is being neglected by me. 
  In fact the building programmes of schools that had long been stalled are now 
  being looked into and new buildings have been put up under various schemes. 
  But I would say that my priority is the rural villages. It is these areas that 
  had suffered the greatest destabilising damage and conditions must be created 
  for people to go back. Several tens of millions of rupees are now being spent 
  on rural infrastructure such as roads, hospitals and dispensaries. I would say 
  that resettlement in Thampalakamam is a fair success. Sippitthidal, Munmaritthidal, 
  Parathipuram, Mulliyady and Patthinipuram have been resettled. They now have 
  a hospital with a maternity ward, a medical ward and an ambulance and patients 
  need not come to Trincomalee except in the serious cases. Because some people 
  went back and resettled the area, other refugees are now coming back, even from 
  places such as Mullaitivu.</p>
<p>&quot;If you look at the refugee phenomenon closely, it is often the case that 
  at the slightest sign of trouble those in villages more accessible from Trincomalee 
  town tend to flee there. You take Ichchilampattai (in the south of the district 
  near Verugal). This has been the most difficult area. It has been changing hands 
  from the Army to the LTTE. But all this time hardly two percent of the people 
  ever fled the area. Sambaltivu, Athimoddai, and Illupaikulam had been resettled, 
  and money is being spent on infrastructure including Rs 15 million on water 
  supply. The LTTE twice attacked the police in Sambaltivu and about 60% of the 
  people ran back to Trincomalee town that is barely 6 miles away. But the rest 
  are staying put, and hopefully those who left would return. Kuchchaveli now 
  has a hospital built by the Swiss Disaster Fund and it is about time the people 
  went back. The rations supplied by the Rehabilitation Ministry too cannot be 
  kept up for ever and sooner or later they would be stopped. We need to work 
  at bringing life back to our villages, if not our villages may be gone forever. 
  As things are, the basics such as a decent school, a hospital and basic help 
  in housing can be provided to those who return. The rest is left to us&quot;.<a href="#a">[Top]</a></p>
<h3><a name="_Toc515698029">Staying home and the political challenge before the 
  Tamils:</a></h3>
<p>Among the urgent questions facing the Tamils of Trincomalee are the abandoned 
  villages and the refugees, many of whom are now around town, seeing little prospect 
  of going back in the near future. There are a number of similarities between 
  those leaving Jaffna and going to Colombo, eventually hoping to go abroad; and 
  those refugees in Trincomalee. If this goes on the former may end up as marginalised 
  plebeians in Western society, while those who abandoned their villages in Trincomalee 
  may find themselves as impoverished vagrants in new slums around Trincomalee 
  town. Both these phenomena have to do with the refusal to tackle serious political 
  and human rights issues internal to the Tamil community. For the middle and 
  upper classes, it has become too comforting to send their children abroad and 
  involve themselves in NGO activities that amount to little more than giving 
  handouts. In this culture there is a good market for blaming the Sri Lankan 
  government, the security forces, the rehabilitation minister Mr.Ashraff and 
  the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress, besides the ordinary Sinhalese, for all the ills 
  of the Tamils. This goes hand in hand with the refusal to face up to the crucial 
  questions posed by the activities of the LTTE. </p>
<p>For those Tamils who intend to retain this country as their home, the problem 
  has reached crisis proportions because the market for blaming the government, 
  the security forces etc. has its greatest demand at the higher and most articulate 
  levels of Tamil society. Whether the latter realise it or not, their conduct 
  suggests that they have much to gain by going on blaming the government and 
  continuing a situation of war. It does help their children to establish themselves 
  abroad. But it also creates hell for those wanting to remain behind. For those 
  sections of Tamil society who support the LTTE or the actions of the other groups 
  such as the murder of T.D.Pieris, the militant cadre and their eventual fate 
  count for nothing. They are just regarded as our thugs who are a useful counter 
  to Sinhalese or Muslim thugs, whether in uniform or without. This makes the 
  task of creating a healthy politics which would help the Tamils to live in dignity 
  at home even more difficult. </p>
<p>The reality is that a good deal has at least temporarily changed for the better 
  under the present government. There is breathing space which was not available 
  before. Activities in the South by peace and political groups have shown that 
  there is far greater receptivity among ordinary Sinhalese people for a just 
  settlement to the war that is also very hurtful to them. There is also more 
  space to mobilise on human rights issues with less fear of repercussions. We 
  too need to use these openings to consolidate and expand them. Our purpose in 
  highlighting continuing deficiencies in the state structures is to help bring 
  about corrective political action and not to feed a market.</p>
<p>If we try to answer the question why the refugees in Trincomalee are not going 
  back to their villages, the blame lies not so much with the rehabilitation effort, 
  but primarily with the policies of the LTTE. The same is true of those leaving 
  Jaffna, who most of the time though, find it far easier and self-justifying 
  to cater to the market and blame the government. In Jaffna those seen to co-operate 
  with the government on rehabilitation and reconstruction have been threatened 
  by the LTTE. Where the LTTE is concerned they do not want the credit to go to 
  anyone else for reconstruction and the restoration of village life. They would 
  keep the people refugees until the war is ended in their favour. One need not 
  explain why this would be catastrophic. Our villages and our community life 
  may then be gone forever. </p>
<p>Thus the political and human rights issues remain paramount. Our first handicap 
  is that there is no real political discussion within our community. For example, 
  why are a number of Tamils happy with the murder of T.D.Pieris? There was similar 
  rejoicing in nationalist quarters in 1975 when Alfred Duraiappah was murdered. 
  The failure to condemn this ultimately led to grave violations and rivers of 
  blood within the community. Twenty two years later, have we not learnt? The 
  problem with Pieris ought to have been tackled politically. The facts were there 
  and so was the commission report. </p>
<p>It is generally considered bad form among Tamils to have a good word for the 
  North-East Provincial Council which was a result of the Indo-Lanka Accord. But 
  many in Trincomalee feel that this was the most hopeful thing that ever happened 
  to the Tamils. Now they see the attack on Sinhalese in 1987 as grave blunder. 
  Had we instead sought accommodation with the Sinhalese then and persuaded them 
  to participate in the NEPC, it would have attained greater stature and stability. 
  Much has thus gone by default owing to the lack of moral and political vision.</p>
<p>It is today far easier for those who are not refugees to see that it is in 
  the best interest of the refugees to go back to their villages, than it is for 
  the refugees themselves. They have gone through the experience of becoming refugees 
  on more than one occasion and thus have legitimate fears. It therefore falls 
  to the community to articulate a politics that gives them confidence. If we 
  have failed to persuade the government to bring to trial those service personnel 
  behind the Killiveddy massacre last year and the jail-break murders recently, 
  what reasonable guarantees can we give those returning to rural villages? Even 
  the jail murders which happened in the heart of town have been covered up with 
  next to no protest.</p>
<p>Once more we return to the theme mentioned at the outset of this report. A 
  large number of Tamils aged 45 and below have one way or the other gained valuable 
  experience through the militant struggle. Much has been learnt and forgotten. 
  What has been learnt must be openly discussed and put to good use. The Trincomalee 
  Urban Council is controlled by such persons. What they have demonstrated by 
  going strictly according to the law and standing up to the Brigadier, is an 
  example of what can be achieved. If they could go even further and convince 
  the Sinhalese residents that their actions are in the common interest of everyone, 
  it would be a hopeful sign.</p>
<p>Trincomalee poses a potent challenge to all those concerned with bringing about 
  peace. It is a misfortune that most peace groups are based in Colombo and have 
  only a cursory understanding of the deeper problems in Trincomalee. Although 
  some of these activists of proven dedication have made a significant impact 
  in the South, the intricacies of Trincomalee go far beyond general sentiments. 
  The ideological workings of the state apparatus, the legacy of Tamil nationalism 
  that fostered strife within and without, and the survival oriented populism 
  of Tamil militant groups, have all combined to create an atmosphere of mutual 
  fear among the different communities. On the other hand the people have continually 
  demonstrated a common vested interest in communal harmony. But with a fragile 
  political climate in the South, the destabilising potential in Trincomalee should 
  not be underestimated. Herein lies the task of the peace groups: to marshal 
  their energies, co-ordinate their activities and bring to bear a common voice 
  of the people.<a href="#a">[Top]</a></p>
