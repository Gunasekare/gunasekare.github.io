    </span>Although the country was saved from imminent war by the
    international community forcing the LTTE to talk to the Government, the LTTE
    once again succeeded in confining the agenda to issues that it saw as obstacles
    to its monopoly on power. The outcome brought mixed relief to the country. Most
    believed that keeping the LTTE talking was the only immediate way to avoid a
    catastrophe, but few thought talks would do anything but postpone the next
    crisis.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>At another time, the
    location Geneva, and the catch-phrase &#8216;peace talks&#8217;, would naturally have
    created high expectations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But
    this time around Sri Lankans had few illusions. They welcomed the talks simply
    as a reprieve from violence after several frightening months.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And most felt quite sure that when
    talks no longer yielded sufficient gains, the LTTE would use violence to
    ratchet up the pressure again.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><span

    </span>Many opportunities have presented themselves over the last
    two decades, to discuss the interests of the Tamil people, but the LTTE has
    never used the forum provided by peace talks. Instead, it always talked about
    &#8216;day to day needs of the people&#8217;, interim or internal self-governing
    authorities to acquire materials, to control foreign aid, consolidate its
    totalitarian grip and to prepare for the next round of &#8216;final war&#8217;. No progress
    can be hoped for unless the LTTE is placed firmly on notice to discuss a
    political settlement.<span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:

    </span>Take the record. The LTTE has interacted with Rajiv Gandhi,
    President Jayewardene, President Premadasa, President Kumaratunge, Prime
    Minister Wickremasinghe, and now President Rajapakse. Gandhi and Premadasa were
    killed by the LTTE. A suicide attack was made on Kumaratunge who attempted a
    federal settlement. Neelan Thiruchelvam one of the main authors of her federal
    proposal (which Balasingham posthumously praised) fell victim to a suicide
    bomber not long before. Wickremasinghe was out-manoeuvred politically. The LTTE
    spokesman Balasingham out talked them all, who were one by one placed out of
    commission.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><span

  <p class=MsoNormal>Most of the leaders above had invited the LTTE leader
    Prabhakaran for face to face talks, including Rajapakse. Over the years the
    Prabhakaran had been entreated to settle his differences with other Tamil
    groups by face to face talks with their leaders, with for example Sri
    Sabaratnam and Padmanabha. He never agreed, and the best he ever did was to
    give insincere assurances through third parties and then seek to kill
    them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If Prabhakaran genuinely
    represented Tamil aspirations he could have used direct talks with Rajapakse to
    advance his case. This he would never do. He will continue to use con men like
    Balasingham to make third party agreements that could be disowned or
    misinterpreted and stretched out of recognition. This was also the fate of the
    2002 Oslo Accord. After all what could be expected after the LTTE became the
    leading oppressor of the Tamil People.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:Tahoma'>

  <p class=MsoNormal>The recent Geneva peace talks were no different. Having
    signed the CFA in 2002, the LTTE proceeded with its set agenda of acquiring
    materials, conscripting children, eliminating political opponents and preparing
    for war. But things started going wrong after the Karuna split. After it killed
    Foreign Minister Kadirgamar, the LTTE stepped up its provocations, appearing to
    prepare for another round of war. The Government responded by setting up killer
    groups to take on LTTE assets. The people too made it clear to the LTTE that
    they were in no position to take another round of war. <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:

    </span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal>The talks in Geneva thus became a sham exchange between the
    parties, each hailing its sincerity to the CFA and the other&#8217;s insincerity. The
    LTTE&#8217;s preoccupation with absolute control, which dominated its agenda, turned
    the Geneva talks into a circus, whose effective centrepiece was an LTTE
    document on &#8220;paramilitaries&#8221; it demanded that the government disarm.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Among them were individuals the LTTE
    knew very well to be purely political opponents from organisations whose
    members it has continually targeted and killed. Unfortunately, Norway and the
    SLMM have over the years aided the LTTE&#8217;s propaganda campaign against political
    opponents by not clarifying the issue and by the disparaging way they treated
    them (see <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Bulletin No.38, 14. The Danger

  <p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;The outcome of the talks thus makes it amply clear
    that the LTTE will go on killing all those whom it thinks would even remotely
    pose a future challenge to them, whether foe or friend of convenience. Its
    immediate objective was to restore the status quo ante it enjoyed before the
    Karuna split and before the Government started relying on counter-terror groups
    to meet the imminent threat of a &#8216;people&#8217;s war&#8217;.<span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'> The latter led to the rise of counter-killings
      in December and January and the withdrawal of the LTTE&#8217;s political offices. <b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Although the LTTE&#8217;s intolerance may be the
        root cause and the Government itself supports and encourages Tamil killer
        groups for short-term objectives, the resulting processes imbue these groups
        with constituencies, resources and alliances that give them significant
        autonomy</b>. The support of governments the LTTE and EPDP enjoyed during
      crucial phases of their growth, made them what they are today, surpassing the
      original purposes for which the support was given.

  <p><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>&nbsp;An example of the
    resulting anarchy is the alleged abduction of 10 TRO workers in the Batticaloa
    District about the end of January (first two and then reportedly another
    released). The facts around these abductions remained murky and appeared on the
    surface a complex plot involving several actors, with the connivance of the
    state security apparatus at local level. <span style='color:black'>But now
      UTHR(J) can confirm that the TRO abduction drama was staged by the LTTE
      immediately before the Geneva meeting to force the paramilitary issue to the
      forefront of the talks. According to a reliable source close to a family member
      of an abducted TRO employee, the family was assured that he is safe and not to
      worry, as all the abductees are safe with the LTTE. But the family was warned
      not to leak this information. Further, we understand that the release of 3
      abductees along with rumours that some of the abductors spoke Hindi was also
      calculated to point the finger of blame at the Karuna faction (which is aligned
      to the ENDLF). This was meant to detract from the Government&#8217;s insistence that
      the abductions were the work of the LTTE. The released abductees were forced to
      relate a story implicating the security forces and the Karuna group.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This also explains LTTE fronts quickly
      becoming silent in demanding the release of the TRO abductees. We withhold further
      information on the ordeal of family members and other information which led us
      to our finding for the sake of the safety of the families. But in the interests
      of peace and accountably, this information needs to be brought into the open.</span></span><span

  <p><span lang=EN-US style='color:black;mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>Not only is the
    LTTE&#8217;s manipulation of the peace process detrimental to the interests of the
    people, it also gives enough leverage for the Government to whitewash its
    misdeeds. Whenever the Government blames the LTTE, it is quite likely to stick.
    Many local sources believe that in recent times many robberies in
    government-controlled areas are being staged at the instigation of the LTTE to
    create a belief that without their control law and order will deteriorate. This
    is a time tested strategy used periodically by the LTTE to delegitimise those
    who are in control. It was a widespread practice during the IPKF period where
    not only were various incidents stage-managed by the LTTE, but fake news items
    about extensive looting and other sinister happenings were planted in the
    newspapers to create an atmosphere of insecurity and panic.&nbsp;

    incidents attributed to &#8220;paramilitaries&#8221; need to be examined afresh. But we
    must also be watchful of the the State and other groups trying to get away by
    simply accusing the LTTE. The situation is becoming murkier and human rights
    reporting all that more difficult.

      Without putting the LTTE on notice to discuss a political settlement, the long

  <p class=MsoNormal>It is thus important to institute measures outside Norway&#8217;s
    involvement, which on past showing could at best keep the LTTE talking. To
    begin with, we need to address the absence of effective mechanisms to enforce
    accountability for very basic violations as murder. It is imperative that
    organisations in the field such as UNICEF, SLMM, and the various INGOs become more
    conscious of the real plight of the people. It is time to focus on issues such
    as democratic space in the Tamil community and the nature of the LTTE, and
    exert pressure to send a message that the international community will not
    tolerate its total disregard for fundamental norms. The urgency is evident in

    issue, the Government needs to provide strong leadership and consolidate
    whatever consensus has been achieved so far towards a political framework for a

    towards this objective by various political and civil society actors over the

    insincerity, but also would be seen as an attempt to reinstate the miserably
    discredited majoritarianism. While engaging with all points of view is

    there is an alternative to LTTE&#8217;s suicidal track. The UNP can play an important
    role if they wish to instead of playing narrow party politics. If instead of
    blaming external forces, the JVP and JHU look within to find out what went
    wrong, they might begin to understand the political realities, rather than make
    demands that drive the Tamils further into the arms of the Tigers. This was
    very well exemplified by the JHU spokesman&#8217;s recent utterances, among which was
    that the bodies of 4 lakhs of Tamils would be sent back to the North. This came
    as a meeting of minds, in response to TNA MP Super Fraud Gajendran&#8217;s bravado in
    parliament that the 40 thousand Sinhalese soldiers in Jaffna would be sent back
    to the South in body bags. It is to be much regretted that the JHU spokesman&#8217;s
    remark did not elicit a sharp condemnation from President Rajapakse or the
    UPFA, given the past bloody outcome of such rhetoric. <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:

    They find it easier to take refuge behind rhetorical promises of equality and
    pretend that that would solve the problem, rather than face the accumulated
    institutional and ideological realities at the root of the ethnic conflict.
    They have never shown any remorse for the manner in which they used the
    occasion of the Indo-Lanka Accord to rhetorically charge the youth into
    unleashing terror, in place of constructive criticism that was the duty of a

    oversight mechanisms to monitor the behaviour of its armed forces and
    violations by them. In this respect if the Sri Lankan state commands the
    courage and wisdom to sign the ICC, it would provide a basis for the State to
    strengthen accountability mechanisms, and give them a badly needed measure of
    credibility. Moreover, it would assist the international community to make also
    the LTTE accountable for its crimes against humanity and war crimes, in arenas
    where the State&#8217;s writ does not run. <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;

  <p class=MsoNormal>The UNP trapped the people and the country by signing in
    haste a lopsided ceasefire agreement that paid no regard to the plight of the
    people in the North-East. In this regard, the UNP should take responsibility as

    multi-pronged vigilante action. In the first two years of the peace process killings
    of unarmed civilians and some security personnel was almost an LTTE monopoly.
    More than 90% of the victims were (and are to this day) Tamils. Both Norway and
    the Government, backed by the peace community, defended the tolerance of this
    state of affairs as being the only means of bringing the LTTE to an agreement.
    Norway and the international community turned a blind eye to the LTTE&#8217;s
    misdoings, and an important section of Colombo-centred civil society in the
    South took the easy way out by equating peace activism to appeasement of the
    LTTE. Despite ritual condemnation of the LTTE&#8217;s actions when events made it
    unavoidable, they did nothing to help open up space for dissent in the Tamil

    </span>Although governments are comfortable ignoring Tamils and Tamil

    matter through the LTTE&#8217;s terror, it is far more difficult to manage the
    Sinhalese and Muslims in the North-East. The Sinhalese especially have their
    lobbies and backers at all levels of the power structure. Armed forces recruits

  <p class=MsoNormal>It is a matter of historical fact that Tamil insecurity

  <p class=MsoNormal>Today, there is little doubt that it is the LTTE&#8217;s
    exclusivism, and the fear that the government in Colombo would give it control
    of Trincomalee that spurred Sinhalese vigilantism in that city. Two particular
    instances indicate that that this vigilantism receives overt and covert support
    from the State and the security apparatus.<span style="mso-spacerun:

    sea front last April by the Navy and local Sinhalese elements. The local

    provides the pretext for spiralling vigilantism and political extremism on both

    </span>Sinhalese fears of LTTE demands helped the election of
    President Mahinda Rajapakse last November, in a story with ironic twists that
    finally gave the LTTE enforced boycott the credit for his victory. Had he
    simply voiced the democratic rights of the Tamils in addition to the fears of
    Sinhalese and Muslims he would have won easily with many Tamil votes to his
    credit. By portraying himself an extremist by allying with the JHU, he scared
    off the Tamils to vote for his opponent and was very likely saved by the LTTE
    imposed bar on Tamils in the North-East casting their vote. The President thus
    cornered himself into running a government that shows very different faces to
    different people. The assassination of Tamil MP Joseph Pararajasingham on
    Christmas Eve 2005 followed by the murder of the five students in Trincomalee
    would have been grave setbacks to any government attempting to moderate its
    image. Elements in the armed forces that favour vigilante actions to promote
    Sinhalese claims appear to be in a stronger position in the state apparatus
    since the election. <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:

  <p class=MsoNormal>But moves towards greater impunity as a response to
    increasing LTTE attacks on the armed forces were already afoot in October last
    year, before the presidential election. We learnt very reliably that security
    officials in Batticaloa had been asked to accommodate dozens of armed Tamil

    </span>On the other hand the President cannot afford a war and
    needs to show accommodativeness to the LTTE leader &#8211; an expressed eagerness to
    sit with him and talk things out. Having rejected Oslo as the venue for talks
    with the LTTE, he accepted Geneva. The reason he gave for rejecting Oslo is the
    LTTE&#8217;s attacks on the armed forces. Once more it exemplifies Colombo&#8217;s outlook
    as not caring an iota for Tamil democracy or the hundreds of Tamils being

    battleground of extremisms. The vast majority that yearns for peace with
    moderation has been rendered voiceless. A number of disparate actors are set to

    </span>A remarkable feature of the ceasefire that came into force
    in 2002 is that although it failed to impose much restraint on the LTTE, the
    terror apparatus of the state and vigilante elements drawn from the Sinhalese
    and Muslims had largely been held in check. But this state of affairs could not
    have continued unless, as many have pointed out, a human rights agreement had
    been brought into force and the LTTE constrained from using murder as a means
    of advancing its claims.<span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:

  <p class=MsoNormal>Rather than expose the LTTE&#8217;s perverted use of the
    ceasefire, we have seen a game of blame shifting, where many of the ongoing
    killings have been attributed to the LTTE&#8217;s opponents and victims. Blame shifting
    also provided cover for the LTTE to whip up war frenzy and alarm the security
    forces with land mine attacks, shootings and screams of a people&#8217;s war by LTTE
    publicity outlets. The result was to remove reasons for restraint by all those
    who feared the LTTE. In December and January we have strong indications (see
    the cases below) of vigilante action by the State and its agents on a scale not
    seen since the mid-1990s.<span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:

    </span><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-US>The LTTE&#8217;s virtual monopoly on killings
    persisted in the North, in our estimation, into December 2005. But it
    persistently tried to obfuscate the issue by accusing &#8216;paramilitries&#8217; and its
    political opponents of these killings. Although LTTE claims were not given much
    credit, agency reporting became cautious about blaming the LTTE for these
    killings in the North. In the East, clashes between the two LTTE factions
    became the main source of violations against non-combatants, apart from
    continuous child conscription and abductions In October 2005<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>two leading school principals,
    Rajadurai and Sivakadatcham, were killed successively in Jaffna. The former was
    a known critic of the LTTE and the latter was apparently close to them.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The first killing was attributed to the
    EPDP and the killing of Rajadurai was explained as a &#8220;tit for tat&#8221;.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Character assassination of Rajadurai
    and threats to him began in earnest several months earlier as discussed in our
    earlier bulletin (No.39).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But
    these two killings in a short period led to the &#8220;tit for tat&#8221; paradigm to
    explain ongoing killings. What was unjustifiable became justifiable. Prompted
    by propaganda outlets, which were hitherto not taken seriously on this point,
    it became the norm to counter-pose LTTE killings with killings supposedly by
    the Army, the EPDP and so-called paramilitaries.</span>&nbsp;<span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:
Tahoma'>
      <o:p></o:p>
    </span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal>While this counter-position, in the absence of effort to
    find out the truth, became politically correct and an easy way out for
    commentators, it was a disaster for the cause of human rights. It was a game of
    crying wolf and it had enormous potential to become a self-fulfilling prophecy.<span

    </span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal>Our own efforts to clarify the Sivakadatcham killing have so
    far been indecisive and we will continue to pursue the matter. However, the
    constant terror faced by educationists is fairly general. The principal and
    vice principal of a leading former mission school in Valikamam North were
    summoned by the LTTE to Killinochchi about the end of February. Their crime as
    it turned out was that on government money provided by Minister Devananda, the
    school had gifted bicycles to some very poor students. (The Central Principal
    was killed after he built a computer centre from money provided by the same
    minister.) The principal from the school in Valikamam North told his LTTE
    interlocutors, &#8220;<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>If we don&#8217;t accept the
      money, they kill us, and if we accept the money you kill us. Now shoot me and
      be done with it</i>&#8221;! The two were allowed to go.<span style="mso-spacerun:

      <o:p></o:p>
    </span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal>Under these circumstances the task of human rights and peace
    activism should have been to probe all killings and allegations as best
    possible, state what the reality is and ensure the protection of potential
    victims. Instead, by painting the very groups under attack by the LTTE as
    paramilitaries and spoilers and thus removing all cause for these groups to
    observe restraint, we create the danger of self-fulfilling prophecy. After the
    Karuna group separated from the LTTE, it asked the children in its ranks to go
    home. Instead of using the opportunity to give the East much needed respite,
    the LTTE&#8217;s Vanni faction was given licence to hunt the Karuna group and
    re-conscript children sent home. Persons on the ground suspect that some recent
    instances of child conscription in Batticaloa were by the Karuna group. If that
    is true it needs to be condemned. <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;

  <p class=MsoNormal>The groundwork was thus laid for the LTTE&#8217;s war manoeuvres.
    Once the Leader made his Heroes Day speech and commenced landmine attacks on
    the armed forces, the plot was almost complete. The state security apparatus
    predictably arm-twisted those who had helplessly faced the LTTE&#8217;s guns to
    perform vigilante services for them. Many had inhibitions against becoming part
    of this vicious cycle. Individuals are faced with a severe moral dilemma which
    most of us are fortunate not to face. The dilemma becomes very pressing when
    they are exposed to stalking death as a group devoid of any protection. To whom
    can they look for a reprieve when human rights activism, which should come to
    their aid, is in the doldrums? Unknown to most observers, preparations were
    being made behind the scenes from about August 2005 to strike terror into LTTE
    supporters in such a way that the Government could disclaim any responsibility.<span

    Information received by us suggests that the Government was preparing to strike
    back at low level or marginal LTTE supporters in a similar vein. To this end
    the Government tried to enlist Tamil groups under attack by the LTTE.<span

  <p class=MsoNormal>A number of groups drawn from different ethnic communities

    conditions for others, who have different political positions from the LTTE, to
    function freely, at least in the government-controlled areas, it is then
    reasonable to talk about &#8220;paramilitaries&#8221; if any armed group with state
    patronage functioned in those areas. But the LTTE used the cease-fire to freely
    kill all others and continued to terrorise the community. <span

  <p class=MsoNormal>Some of these other Tamil groups had killed in the past, but
    the restraint they showed for whatever reason deserves to be commended. It was
    nevertheless a source of worry that these groups may be tipped over into
    counter vigilante action or even the military would apply pressure on them to
    do their dirty work. But apart from them, there are many former LTTE cadres and
    cadres from other organisations, who were not given any option to survive in
    the community, but were forced to work with the Army. Their fear was very real
    and during the ceasefire the LTTE had killed many ex-militants who tried to
    lead normal lives. <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:

  <p class=MsoNormal>It is alleged that one Tamil party leader was enlisted for
    vigilante action against the LTTE using money given by the State to recruit
    persons. If it is true, this is just one instance of a killer group. According
    to our source, among those recruited were two persons from Karuna&#8217;s group who
    tried to go abroad and were stuck in Colombo. The killer units were
    supplemented by Military Intelligence. This leader also used this money to buy
    up persons from other groups facing personal hardship, leading to fear and
    resentment within those groups. According to a Tamil party source, some PLOTE
    members and their vehicle were caught up inadvertently in the Sivaram killing
    last April after they were asked to bring their vehicle by associates of the
    Tamil party leader (who belonged to another group). Such requests for vehicles
    of another group for unspecified reasons were commonly made to members of the
    group who enjoyed financial favours. This story is hard to check without the
    kind of thorough inquiry that would not take place. But it should alert us to
    the kind of deviousness that was previously unknown outside the LTTE.<span

  <p class=MsoNormal>So far it has been widely assumed that Member of Parliament
    Joseph Pararajasingam was killed by the Karuna group. But it happened on 24<sup>th</sup> December in the context of the Government giving the green light to local
    killer groups to take on perceived LTTE assets at their discretion. The new
    information about the Sivaram killing should caution us against pinning the
    blame on Karuna exclusively. It is the Government that must be held principally

    killings in November &#8211; Military Intelligence Colonel Rizwi Meedin (30 Oct.),

  <p class=MsoNormal>Parallel preparations were being made by the LTTE to
    prosecute its people&#8217;s war, where again a new element of deviousness is
    evident. We have mentioned several times before that the LTTE was mobilising
    lumpen elements in society for its vigilante actions and violence. Early in the
    morning of 16<sup>th</sup> November (the day before the presidential election
    where the LTTE had ordered Jaffna residents not to vote), the LTTE&#8217;s Culture
    Police brought the youth M. Dinesh (22) to the Kokkuvil Hindu College football
    field, summoned the people and slowly beat him to death. The LTTE organ <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Nitharsanam</i> stated that the youth who
    was supposedly involved in anti-social activities was beaten to death by angry
    people. Information received by us suggests that the youth was previously used
    by the LTTE, and under pressure to do more such actions as throwing bombs at
    the Army, he tried to avoid them. The victim&#8217;s mother and elder sister pleaded
    with the assailants to spare him. But no remorse was shown. The people in fact
    were deeply upset and terrorised. Others too had run away to escape the LTTE&#8217;s
    orders to attack the Army.<span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:

    </span>This situation opens up some painful questions for human
    rights activism and reporting. The label paramilitaries occurring in the CFA
    has been used to place killings of party activists and security personnel
    outside the purview of human rights monitoring and the SLMM has promoted this
    view. Do not developments in Sri Lanka show this separation to be thoroughly unproductive

  <p class=MsoNormal>On an even more poignant matter, the LTTE in an abuse of the
    spirit of the ceasefire, has continually threatened 40,000 troops in Jaffna
    with total annihilation. Recently the threat was made more immediate with
    preparations for a so called &#8220;people&#8217;s war&#8221; further blurring the distinction
    between combatants and civilians. Could one in practice seek to protect the

    </span>In the case of T. Kailainathan, the public servant in the
    EPDP leader&#8217;s ministry killed on 5<sup>th</sup> April 2005, an insider told
    UTHR(J) that before his killing he had a dispute with the minister&#8217;s brother
    Dayananda, who manages finances for the Party. Kailainathan is said to have
    refused to certify a job for the ministry for which he was the contractor.
    Dayananda, according to this source was heard remarking, &#8220;<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

    It was speculated that the job had been done by paid agents in the Karuna
    group. The Police, it was felt, hushed up the investigation and an additional
    secretary and other administrators who became afraid got themselves transferred
    out of the ministry of vocational education. These sources have heard inside

    is that the Police did not proceed with the investigation of a cell phone
    dropped by the killers, and also talk within that a cadre named Murali

    death. The London-based LTTE-run IBC Radio described Sooriyamoorthy as a man
    castaway (thrown) and rejected by the people, in reference to his not being

    Moreover the Police do not even investigate killings done by the LTTE. Even if
    these killings were actually done by the EPDP, the LTTE&#8217;s lower ranks and
    propaganda organs would likely have assumed that they were indeed the work of

    </span>Subramaniam Suhirtharajan (35), a stringer for the Uthayan

    Sans Frontieres was quick to claim that his murder owed to his exposure of
    abuses committed by paramilitary groups. This was on the face of the evidence
    unconvincing and the RSF had failed to do its research and observe due caution.
    Had the RSF pointed to state-supported Sinhalese vigilantism in Trincomalee, it
    would have been very plausible. What the RSF and its sources missed out is that
    the LTTE-intelligence related web site <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Nitharshanam</i> carried on the very same day, a stinging attack on the Uthayan editor for
    having met and interviewed President Rajapakse, akin to the warning given to

  <p class=MsoNormal>The point we wish to make here is that indifferent reporting
    influenced by LTTE propaganda and statements based on such reporting reinforced
    calculated provocations by the LTTE to precipitate war. The cases we present
    below concentrate on those that made a significant impact and yet proved very
    obscure, and several of them remain so. There was a period from October to
    about 20<sup>th</sup> December when the state forces in Jaffna were being
    blamed for violations they most likely did not commit. The height of this was
    the contrived affair where the Army was falsely accused of shooting at
    demonstrators from the University of Jaffna. Although the Army fired into the
    ground, beat up many and handled the situation in an un-professional manner,
    the propaganda version that the army fired at the crowd unprovoked is a
    misleading one. Nevertheless, the Army&#8217;s reaction to the protest cannot be
    condoned. The LTTE boasted of a fifth column in Jaffna ready to take on the
    Army in a &#8216;people&#8217;s war&#8217;.<span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:

    </span>We believe that it was about this time that orders went down
    to individual army camps giving them the discretion to crack down on LTTE
    assets in their area. Given the drubbing governments have faced in the past for
    human rights abuses, this could not have happened without approval at the
    highest level. We base this on the fact that late December was about the time
    that the armed forces got involved in vigilante action and information that
    such orders were in currency when the 2 Bojan ladies were murdered on 16<sup>th</sup> January.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This discretion we
    reliably understand was partially rescinded 2 days after the impact of the
    killing of the Bojan ladies. Their connection was more through a son who had
    died for the LTTE. By partially rescinded we mean, as we understood, that local
    camps were told not to take decisions to kill on their own.<span

    </span>That the Government was preparing for such action was
    indicated by the report from Batticaloa last October and a report from Jaffna
    subsequently that a senior Military Intelligence officer had been posted to
    Jaffna. The latter&#8217;s specialty was to work with LTTE deserters from the
    mid-1990s (of whom there are several hundreds) and mould them into a
    counter-insurgency force. This is a natural outcome of the LTTE&#8217;s terror and
    any state force, based on their gut feeling, will try to use them for their
    military purposes. But without any political initiatives these methods will
    bring only partial success and most of the time would legitimise LTTE&#8217;s terror

    Weerakody, since retired, ran an iron-smith&#8217;s shop on Orr&#8217;s Hill. As part of
    the LTTE&#8217;s bid to provoke a re-emergence of Sinhalese vigilantism, its gun men
    shot Weerakody dead just outside his home about 8.00 PM on Christmas eve. The

  <p class=MsoNormal>The atrocity is more shocking for its having been
    premeditated and both the Army and the LTTE gave cause for suspicion, making it
    a difficult case. The Bojans were a family displaced from Kollankalladdy and
    living in Manipay. One son had died a member of the LTTE. The father, an old
    time supporter of the Federal Party, kept out of politics in recent times and
    was involved in such activities as the Boy Scout movement and the St. John&#8217;s
    Ambulance Brigade. While reports of the incident admit several variations, the
    Jaffna daily <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Uthayan</i> of 17<sup>th</sup> January gave a matter of fact report after speaking to the survivors.<span

    <o:p></o:p>
    </span>At 12.40 AM on 16<sup>th</sup> January, intruders who had
    scaled the wall knocked on the door and demanded to search the house. When Mr.
    Bojan opened the door he was asked to put his hands up. His second unmarried
    daughter Shanuka (23) rushed out of the house and the intruders shot her down.
    Then Mrs. Arthanareeswary Bojan (51) and her newly married eldest daughter and
    English teacher Renuka (30) rushed out, Renuka was gunned down. The mother, as
    we subsequently learnt, died of a heart attack. Bojan&#8217;s son Ullasan, a
    mathematics teacher at Jaffna Central College was also injured. The gunmen withdrew
    after shooting Mr. Bojan in the leg. The report also said that 9 gunmen in
    civils had come and left their residence at 17 Kanagasabai Mudali Street,
    Manipay, in a white van, one of them wearing a mask. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

    </span>The Army website which uses strong words as gruesome to
    describe LTTE attacks on the armed forces did not touch incident at all. On the
    other hand some civilians close to the family were strongly leaning towards the
    view that the LTTE was responsible. The family was a &#8216;Heroes Family&#8217; and the
    dead girl Shanuka had acted in a film made by the LTTE&#8217;s media unit. Also the
    LTTE had asked all Heroes families to move to Vanni in order to be part of
    their military effort. To this end the LTTE had besides whipping up war fever
    by attacks on the Army had stopped material aid to Heroes families who did not
    move to their area. <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:

    <o:p></o:p>
    </span>The Bojans thus lived on in Manipay defying the LTTE. The
    day before the incident, the LTTE approached the girls and asked them to move to
    Vanni. But they declined, telling them they cannot just leave the house and
    belongings. The girls too were reputedly spirited girls who could not be
    ordered around. Suspicion was also aroused by the manner in which LTTE sources
    were presenting their case with several anomalies. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>TamilNet</i> blamed the EPDP and Military Intelligence, but otherwise
    went little beyond the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Uthayan</i>. The
    most concrete charges were made by the LTTE&#8217;s Jaffna political commissar
    Illamparithy in a statement published in the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Uthayan </i>on the 17<sup>th</sup>. He claimed that the white van after
    leaving the scene of crime had proceeded to Navaly Nachchimar temple through
    Pipili junction and had returned to the Manipay army camp. He also claimed that
    later two military intelligence operatives Ramesh and Mahesh Bandara had passed
    the funeral house on a motor cycle, grinning.<span style='mso-bidi-font-size:

    <o:p></o:p>
    </span>Illamparithy&#8217;s pointed charges were dropped by other LTTE
    organs and were not repeated by anyone. NESHOR in a report made subsequently
    brought in hitherto unreported allegations of an army presence near the house
    during the late night hours leading up to the incident.<span

    was in the lane on the 15<sup>th</sup> afternoon around 3.00 &#8211; 4.00 PM. <span

    </span>These circumstantial factors and the significant weight of
    opinion made the case against the LTTE plausible, but there was no decisive
    evidence either way. The fact that LTTE fronts fairly quickly stopped making an
    issue of this terrible atrocity with enormous propaganda potential, beyond
    making the women victims Tamil National Patriots, was striking. The reality
    seems that families with LTTE connections were not impressed with the LTTE
    making them bear the brunt of their whipped up war frenzy and provocations.
    This we understand was an important factor in the LTTE agreeing to talks in
    Geneva.<span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:Tahoma'>

  <p class=MsoNormal>We also received other reports pointing to the Army. Army
    sources in Jaffna regretfully complained to a civilian that they had maintained
    good public relations in the Manipay area, but this atrocity had ruined it.
    About the same time we received information that army camps had been allowed
    the discretion to carry out killings, but the discretion to individual camps
    was withdrawn two days after the Bojan incident. <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:

  <p class=MsoBodyText2 style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>Others in Jaffna felt that army officers at a high
    level were not directly involved, but it was more in the nature of a military
    intelligence operative posted to the area anew, taking the decision after
    advice from Tamils helping them. While it began to appear that the Army was
    responsible or at least sections in the Army thought so, we kept getting
    reports, and one from a person with very close ties to the family, that the
    LTTE killed the Bojan women. While LTTE commissar Illamparithy held that the
    women were killed by the Army and EPDP men who recently went to their home and
    threatened them, the relative said that the LTTE had gone home and demanded
    that the women as members of a heroes family should leave for the Vanni. The
    women had refused. Purely by the nature of the weapons, local observers suggest
    the EPDP as an alternative to the LTTE, but cannot cite any other indication
    pointing to the EPDP&#8217;s direct involvement in this kind of activity.
    <o:p></o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal>Most decisively for us, a trusted informant told us that the
    vehicle in which the killers left made a detour and returned to the Manipay
    army camp. Rather remarkably, this agrees with the statement made by LTTE
    commissar Illamparithy, which other LTTE accounts dropped completely. This
    source told us that among those who went on the mission were Military
    Intelligence persons with names resembling Ramesh and Mahes (but not the Mahesh
    Bandara Illamparithy had referred to according to this source) and a Tamil
    militant, probably EPDP or ex-EPDP, whose name we do not have. This may have
    been planned as revenge for the LTTE&#8217;s murder five days earlier of Miss.
    Pavalarani Kanapathipillai of Mattuvil, fianc&eacute;e of senior EPDP member Charles.
    We were also told that senior persons in the Army had nothing to do with the
    incident and perhaps Mahes and Ramesh were trying to &#8216;show results&#8217; in keeping
    with the general order to target the LTTE in their area. It is in the nature of
    the times where the same persons are under threat from different parties for
    their own reasons, and one is at a loss when something happens. <span

  <p class=MsoNormal>The EPDP has condemned all killings of civilians and blamed
    the LTTE for the Bojan killings, pointing out that the family is close kin of
    their senior member Mr. Sivathasan. They are in a position to give a fuller
    account of the incident in their own interests and correct us if need be in
    what is truly a messy and confusing affair. It is however imperative that the

  <p class=MsoNormal>We made reference to this in our briefing of 27<sup>th</sup> December. We mentioned that early on, the general opinion in the area was that
    the Navy was responsible for the rape and murder of Tharshini. Tharshini who
    left her home for her aunt&#8217;s around 7.15 PM on 16<sup>th</sup> December was
    recovered from a well near temple more than 200 yards from the Navy camp. We
    received some preliminary information before our Briefing went out. We stated
    local testimony which said that some persons were hanging about near the temple
    for several days prior to the killing of Tharshini and also that she was having
    affairs with several naval men. We stated this merely to alert the reader that
    there may be a different angle to the affair, and later realised that we may have
    been unfair to the deceased. <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>We
      unreservedly apologise for the wording, which we now know to be ill-founded and

    </span>We have continued to pursue this angle. We learnt that the
    person who originally said that some persons were hanging about near the temple
    prior to the killing of Tharshini and then vanished is now unwilling to talk.
    But after about two months of inquiries we received some substantive
    information of a circumstantial nature. But this would not be worth pursuing until
    difficulties in the public domain are cleared.<span style='mso-bidi-font-size:

    </span>Firstly the Navy has done nothing to deny their involvement
    or say anything about an internal inquiry, if there was one. They seem to be
    depending on the absence of evidence or witnesses for the courts to clear them.
    One must thus take the possible involvement of the Navy very seriously. There
    are a number of theories in circulation pointing to novel scenarios, but have
    no basis in known fact. These are a reminder of how involved the case is. The
    EPDP too has good sources of information in the area, and its silence is almost
    deafening. &nbsp;<span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:

    <o:p></o:p>
    </span>The basic known facts are these. Tharshini left her home in
    Pungudutivu about sunset to sleep at her aunt&#8217;s place. From her home she took a
    footpath leading to a gravel road. To the left from the top of the foot path
    the gravel road leads to the navy camp, according to our information of the
    order of a mile or more distant. Her body was found in the well of a temple
    down this road towards the navy camp, but more than 200 yards from it. It is
    not close in the sense that there is no obstacle from the Navy to a civilian
    presence in the area of the well.<span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;

    <o:p></o:p>
    </span>It would have been easier to believe that the Navy was
    responsible for the crime, had Tharshini cycled towards the navy camp, and was
    found by persons in the area of the navy camp in the semi-darkness, raped and
    killed. However, the report by NESOHR (in the web), which unequivocally blames
    the Navy, gives us some remarkable information in the map it presents. The
    report&#8217;s evidence makes it clear that almost the entirety of Tharshini&#8217;s
    journey was involuntary. Starting from the foot path and close to her home, one
    slipper of hers, the braces for her teeth and then the other slipper, were
    found in turn covering the route from her home along the gravel road to the
    place of the tragedy. This means she was abducted near her home, conducted
    towards the navy camp, raped and killed not far from the navy camp, but where
    unchallenged civilian movement was possible.<span style='mso-bidi-font-size:

    <o:p></o:p>
    </span>The NESOHR report also says that people in the area of
    Tharshini&#8217;s home were largely displaced and there were several abandoned houses
    providing free access to intruders. Why intending rapists took her all the way
    to the well is something in need of explanation, unless the involvement of the
    Navy is proved independently by some incontrovertible evidence.<span

    </span>At present the only evidence before the courts is an item of
    headgear said to have been discovered near the scene of crime. The CID has reported
    to the Court that the headgear belonged not to the Navy, but to someone serving
    in the Army in Batticaloa. The matter is proceeding. We will wait for the
    courts to pronounce on the evidence and postpone the matter to another report.
    The leads we obtained are themselves not decisive, but the Court&#8217;s ruling would

    LTTE, which dwelt heavily on the Karuna group&#8217;s alleged links to the Government
    and Muslim politicians. But on the most newsworthy item of the day, the murder
    of Puhalventhan&#8217;s two sisters, the account had nothing to say, considering the
    Police account had been referred to in the Tamil press (e.g. Thinnakural) two
    days earlier. Chandrakumar (i.e. Puhalventhan) had been named the prime
    suspect.<span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:Tahoma'>

  <p class=MsoNormal>The drama took another extra-ordinary turn two days later
    (13<sup>th</sup>), when Iniyabharathy rose as it were from the dead to give
    interviews to the TBC and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Asian Tribune</i>.
    He gave his account of what happened in the fighting in the Kanjikudichcharu.
    The mere fact of the interviews contradicts the LTTE&#8217;s claim or second thoughts
    that Puhalventhan deserted to them after killing Iniyabharathy. In
    Iniyabharathy&#8217;s interview the story of the killing of the two sisters took
    another bizarre turn.<span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:

  <p class=MsoNormal>Iniyabharathy was defensive of Puhalventhan, saying that he
    made a recitation under duress. As to the sisters, he claimed that they had
    been killed by Ganeshapillai Yogarasa alias Santhiran, husband of Yogeswary, as
    the consequence of a quarrel arising from his extra-martial affairs. He added
    that Yogarasa surrendered to the Vanni faction.<span style='mso-bidi-font-size:

    </span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal>Contrarily, those who accepted the police report thought
    that in order to save his life, Puhalvanthan had agreed to co-operate with the
    Vanni faction, and the latter to test him had sent him to kill his
    brother-in-law Yogarasa whom they took to be a Karuna supporter. The sisters
    resisted, and in a panic Puhalventhan threw a grenade and ran away.<span

    </span>Our repeated inquires in Batticaloa threw little further
    light and the case remains open. Even people fairly close to the incident
    relied on media reports, themselves often confused. People changed their
    opinion depending on what they heard next. They were too afraid to make
    independent inquiries. Out attempts to get some indication from the family
    proved of no avail. We learnt that through fear the family had gone into hiding
    and were uncontactable.<span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:

    </span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal>This is another matter that should not be left being kicked
    around, with those who have the means to clear such cases taking the easy way
    out in ambivalent statements, which only helps the cause of anarchy.<span

  <p class=MsoNormal>The Police report is perhaps the best starting point. Legal
    sources in Batticaloa who have been seen it, treat it as a serious document. It
    appears a straightforward &#8216;<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>ralahamy&#8217;s</i>&#8217;
    report without preconceptions. The Police had no reason to invent a peculiar
    story. In the unlikely event that the Eravur police heard the news Puhalventhan
    the previous day, it is even more unlikely that they associated the person in
    LTTE custody with Chandrakumar. The Police and witnesses have not been tested
    by cross-examination in court. But there is no reason why accredited
    institutions that can give guarantees of confidentiality and protection cannot
    do it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:

    left the EPRLF a long while ago and with his family, which included 3 children,
    was living in the weaving centre refugee camp in Kallady. That morning he had
    gone on his bicycle to purchase fish, which he then cycled about selling to

    who disagreed with the political approach of the mainstream and decided that
    the only way to challenge the LTTE is through violence. The group is long
    defunct and its remaining members were absorbed into the Sri Lankan Army.
    Sinnavan&#8217;s association with them was very brief and he left them a long time

    to reflect on their experience, who form the back bone of any move for
    corrective and restorative action. Their former mates paid an enormous price

    It is very sad if human rights groups cannot act with greater imagination, and

    taken to be not unreasonable, despite the fact that its record is one of
    obstructing any attempt at a settlement, even federal arrangements. Where the people
    are concerned, they only want justice, dignity and a credible system of law and
    order in which the Sri Lankan polity has dismally failed. Even at the highest
    level, the Supreme Court&#8217;s failure to deliver justice to the victims of the
    Bindunuwewa massacre and its ruling on the unlawfully erected Buddha statue on
    the Trincomalee sea front should cause us deep concern. One may not be wrong in

    has terrorised the people and launched three &#8216;final battles&#8217; (<i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>iruthi yutthams</i>) from 1990. We are no
    nearer liberation. But every five years or so the people have been forced to
    flee their homes in the face of falling bombs and shells, clutching plastic
    bags; only to return months later to looted or destroyed homes, dead or missing
    kin and then live amidst fields freshly sown with mines. This is no recipe for
    a thriving civilisation. The people&#8217;s faith in the coming <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>iruthi yuttham</i> is demonstrated by their sullen resistance to the
    idea of fleeing once more. The LTTE&#8217;s subsequent attempts to assure them that
    all they need to do is to remain unharmed in their homes while they
    systematically wipe out 40 000 soldiers, who are supported by air power and
    cannon, were met with horrified disbelief.<span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;

      <o:p></o:p>
    </span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal>The LTTE is itself in a desperate bind. Those who know them well
    are clear that they are pushing for war irrespective of talks in Geneva. They
    are trapped in their own rhetoric and claims of sole representation that have
    been discredited particularly by the Karuna split. An attempt at taking Jaffna
    may be their only hope of a signal victory. That too is a high-risk strategy
    and success too would likely mean prolonged war and complete loss of the East.
    In the long run numbers are against the LTTE and that has been the deciding
    factor in all wars. <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:

      <o:p></o:p>
    </span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal>Faced with indefinite war and the loss of quality in life,
    most Tamils who can escape are continuing to escape. A second generation has
    come to maturity abroad having both opportunities and distinctive success in
    education. They have come a long way from the years of communally-based
    standardisation and the abysmal year of 1975 when an unthinking government
    imposed on Tamil students the combined disabilities of media-wise
    standardisation and district quotas. The number of university entrants from
    Jaffna Hindu College was reduced to 5 (2 Engineering, 2 Humanities, 1 Vet Sc.),
    down from above 20 for engineering alone in earlier years. In the coming years
    commonsense prevailed and these disabilities of discrimination were largely
    overcome. The fate of Jaffna schools today is largely of our own making and the
    political dispensation that necessitates perpetual war.<span style='mso-bidi-font-size:

      <o:p></o:p>
    </span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal>By extending its terror overseas the LTTE succeeded in
    mobilising the resources of emigrants for its war effort and propaganda. Many
    of those with reservations took trips home and did stints in relief work during
    the cease-fire. But a number of factors have prevented them from undertaking
    the crucial task of challenging the political dispensation. Contact with LTTE
    fronts like the TRO also induces blindness and indifference to enormities such
    as child conscription.<span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:
Tahoma'>
      <o:p></o:p>
      </span>&nbsp;<span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:
Tahoma'>
      <o:p></o:p>
    </span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal>The hard reality is that no amount of destructive technology
    and more sophisticated suicide squads can compensate for the social decline and
    the sharp erosion of the population. Overseas Tamils as tools of the LTTE are
    fast losing their cutting edge as the populations they live among become
    outraged by child soldiers, extortion and suicide bombers. In Australia for
    example regular donors to the TRO have been asked to stop contributions after
    recent raids by the authorities (as instructed strangely by the &#8216;Tamil
    Coordinating Committee&#8217;, from which the TRO earlier tried to distance itself).
    LTTE operators try to pretend that there is no cause for alarm since the Police
    released those detained for questioning. However, the charges in the search
    warrant, details of businesses and bank accounts show clearly that the Police
    did their homework and the charges of aiding and abetting terrorism are far too
    serious to be taken lightly.<span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:

    </span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal>On the other hand if the Tamils at home are democratically
    mobilised the Tamils overseas can become a tremendous asset, rather than being
    confused, divided and frightened of fellow Tamils as they are today. Then with
    regard to a political settlement there is every chance that commonsense would
    prevail.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
