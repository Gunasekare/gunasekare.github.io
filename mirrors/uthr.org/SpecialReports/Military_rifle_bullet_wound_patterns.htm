text-align:center'>Military rifle bullet wound patterns</h1>

<p align=center style='margin-right:12.0pt;margin-left:12.0pt;text-align:center'>-
by Martin L. Fackler</p>

<p style='margin-right:12.0pt;margin-left:12.0pt;text-align:justify'>In
addition to the full-metal-jacketed construction which makes them
&quot;military&quot; bullets, the pointed ogival &quot;spitzer&quot; tip shape
is shared by all modern military bullets. The obvious advantage of this
streamlined shape is decreased air drag, allowing the bullet to retain velocity
better for improved long-range performance. A modern military 7.62 mm bullet
(with all-lead core) will lose only about one-third of its muzzle velocity over
467 m; the same weight bullet with a round-nose shape loses more than one-half
of its velocity over the same distance. </p>

<p style='margin-right:12.0pt;margin-left:12.0pt;text-align:justify'>More
pertinent to the present discussion is this pointed shape's effect on the
bullet's yaw in tissue. The first full-metal-jacketed bullets (1885-1910) were
over four calibres long and round-nosed. Typical of this bullettype are the 6.5
mm Carcano and the 30-40 Krag bullets; they penetrate tissue simulant
travelling point-forward for 50 cm or more before significant yaw begins
(Fackler, M.L., unpublished data, 1987). The very minimal wounding effect
produced by these early round-nosed jacketed bullets was remarked upon by
surgeons of the time (Kocher, Markins, Brunner, Abbott, LaGarde, etc.). Even
those soldiers with through-and-through chest wounds in which the bullet missed
the large vessels (but passed through the lung) would be fit to rejoin their
units in a few weeks. </p>

<p style='margin-right:12.0pt;margin-left:12.0pt;text-align:justify'>The
distance that the military-type bullet travels point-forward before yawing is
critical to wounding effects. The distance shown on the wound profiles is the
average distance at which this occurs. However, it is important to recognise
how much shot-to-shot variation from this average distance can be expected.
Taking the M16 wound profile (Fig. 6) as an example, it shows significant yaw
starting at a 12cm penetration depth. Seven out of ten shots can be expected to
begin yaw within 26 % of this distance (between nine and 16 cm penetration
depth). This plus or minus 25 % rule is a useful approximation that can be
applied to the otherwound profiles. Let us apply it to the 50 cm distance-to-
yaw for the older bullets; whether the bullet begins to yaw between 37 or 63 cm
penetration distance does not effect most wounds of the human body because, in
the great majority of cases, the total tissue path will be less than 37 cm. </p>

<p style='margin-right:12.0pt;margin-left:12.0pt;text-align:justify'>Conversely,
inconsistent effects have been noted in wounds caused by the M16 and other
modern military bullets. Considering the variation in length of the possible
tissue path through the human body, this &quot;inconsistency&quot; of effect is
to be expected. Beware! This variation can be used to dupe the unsuspecting. A
series of shots through a 14 or 15 cm block of tissue simulant or the leg of a
25 kg animal can give enough variation so that, by selective choice of exit
wound photographs, one can &quot;prove&quot; any point one wishes (such as one
bullet being less &quot;humane&quot; than another). The author hopes, that
understanding this, will make the reader less likely prey to this sort of
deception. </p>

<p style='margin-right:12.0pt;margin-left:12.0pt;text-align:justify'>Bullet
mass and bullet striking velocity establish a bullet's potential; they set the
limit on the tissue disruption it can produce. Bullet shape and construction
determine how much of this potential is actually used to disrupt tissue; they
are the major determinants of bullet effect. Far and away the most disruptive
bullet of those described is the West German 7.62 NATO round. Its fragmenting
behaviour maximises utilisation of its much higher potential (bullet mass well
over twice that of any of the 5.56mm bullets and velocity only about ten
percent less than theirs) for tissue disruption. </p>

<p style='margin-right:12.0pt;margin-left:12.0pt;text-align:justify'>This
author has not tested other European 7.62 NATO rounds, but the &quot;NATO
standards&quot; apparently allow bullet designers great latitude in the choice
of bullet jacket material and thickness. In 1979 a published high-speed x-ray
photograph showed the Swedish 7.62 equivalent to the 7.62 NATO bullet breaking
in a soap block shot at a range of 100m. Although bullet fragments were not
recovered and photographed (the importance of bullet fragmentation in tissue
disruption was not well recognised at the time), one must suspect the same very
disruptive behaviour from this bullet as from the West German round. This is
particularly ironic since the Swedish wound ballistics program was using every
means possible to discredit the M16 as &quot;inhumane&quot; while, at the same
time, Sweden was producing a 7.62 mm military bullet that caused far more
extensive wounds than the M16. </p>

<p style='margin-right:12.0pt;margin-left:12.0pt;text-align:justify'>Whether we
like to admit it or not, the primary purpose of military rifle bullets is to
disrupt human tissue. Yet the effects of bullets on bodies - the characteristic
tissue disruption patterns produced by various bullets - remains unclear even
to many of those who design and produce bullets. Surgeons who are called upon
to treat the damage bullets cause, with few exceptions, lack practical
knowledge of bullet effects. Attempts to fill this information void with
formulae, graphs, flawed experiments, invalid assumptions, and theories based
on half-truth (or no truth at all) have only increased confusion. </p>

<p style='margin-right:12.0pt;margin-left:12.0pt;text-align:justify'>The
obvious - simply measuring, recording and describing the disruption produced by
various calibres and bullet types - has largely been ignored in favour of more
dramatic and complex methodology. To illustrate the problem: if a neighbour
told you that a meteorite had fallen into his back yard, wouldn't you ask him
how deep and how large a hole it had made? If he replied that he had, on good
authority, an estimation of the meteor's striking velocity and the amount of
kinetic energy it had &quot;deposited&quot; and gave you both these figures,
you might be impressed by the sophistication of this information, but you still
wouldn't know how big a hole he had in his yard. </p>

<p style='margin-right:12.0pt;margin-left:12.0pt;text-align:justify'>Roger
Frost, in his cogent editorial &quot;Bullet holes in theories&quot; (IDR 8/1988
p.875) suggested that the various groups interested in gunshot wounds need to
&quot;start to talk to one another&quot;. Let's add that the talk needs to be
in terms that can be understood by all - to inform rather than to impress. </p>

<p style='margin-right:12.0pt;margin-left:12.0pt;text-align:justify'>In order
to illustrate the penetrating projectile-body tissue interaction, the
&quot;wound profile&quot; method was developed. It is an attempt to present a
useful approximation of the pertinent, useful, factual data to clarify bullet
effects in a form that can be readily understood. The profiles depict the
maximum disruption that a given bullet can be expected to produce in the
elastic soft tissue of the living animal. The &quot;permanent crush
cavity&quot; indicated on the wound profiles is the &quot;bullethole&quot;
produced by the projectile crushing the tissue it strikes. The &quot;temporary
stress cavity&quot; shows the approximate extent to which the walls of this
hole were stretched a few milliseconds after bullet passage (entirely analogous
to a splash in water). </p>

<p style='margin-right:12.0pt;margin-left:12.0pt;text-align:justify'>Anyone who
has ever seen a bullet hole recognises that in many cases it is, in fact, more
what might be called a potential hole; it need not be gaping open. One can,
however, easily pass a probe through it, as is commonly done by forensic
pathologists to establish the direction or angle of the shot. How deeply the
bullet penetrated and its attitude (yawed or straight) and form (deformed or
fragmented) as it penetrated. along with the approximate distance the walls of
the hole were stretched after the bullet passed (temporary cavity) - this is
the crucial information needed to understand the wounding mechanisms. </p>

<p style='margin-right:12.0pt;margin-left:12.0pt;text-align:justify'>To
describe wounding patterns of the common military rifle bullets in use today,
wound profiles will, along with a description of the two characteristic wounds
for each bullet, be used. A simple abdominal wound, and an uncomplicated
(didn't hit bone or large vessels) human thigh wound caused by each bullet,
will be described to demonstrate how the material presented as wound profiles,
can be put to practical use. This should give the combat surgeon some idea of
what to expect. His descriptions of the wounds he actually treats, if they
differ significantly from the expected pattern, might be the first indication
of a change in enemy weapon or bullet type. Patterns of bullet fragmentation as
seen on x-ray, or even the tissue disruption pattern as observed in the body,
can be compared with the series of wound profiles to estimate the bullet type
when the bullet has passed entirely through. </p>

<p style='margin-right:12.0pt;margin-left:12.0pt;text-align:justify'>Soviet
7.62x39mm - The Soviet AK-47 Kalashnikov fires a full-metal-jacketed, boat-tail
bullet that has a copper-plated steel jacket, a large steel core, and some lead
between the two. In tissue, this bullet typically travels for about 26cm
point-forward before beginning significant yaw. This author observed, on many
occasions, the damage pattern shown in Fig. 2 while treating battle casualties
in Da Nang, Vietnam (1968). The typical path through the abdomen caused minimal
disruption; holes in organs were similar to those caused by a non-hollow-point
handgun bullet. The average uncomplicated thigh wound was about what one would
expect from a low-powered handgun: a small, punctuate entrance and exit wound
with minimal intervening muscle disruption. </p>

<p style='margin-right:12.0pt;margin-left:12.0pt;text-align:justify'>Yugoslav
7.62x39mm - The Yugoslav copper-jacketed, lead-core, flat-base bullet, even
when fired from the same Kalashnikov assault rifle, acts very differently in
tissue. It typically travels point-forward for only about 9cm before yawing.
Due to the lead core, this bullet flattens somewhat as it yaws, squeezing a few
small lead fragments out at its open base, but this does not add significantly
to its wounding potential. Referring to the wound profile of the Soviet AK-47
bullet (Fig. 2) and blotting out the first 17cm of the projectile path will
leave a good approximation of what one might expect from this bullet. </p>

<p style='margin-right:12.0pt;margin-left:12.0pt;text-align:justify'>Since this
bullet would be travelling sideways through most of its path in an abdominal
wound, it would be expected to cut a swath over three times the dimension made
by the bullet travelling point forward. In addition to the larger hole in
organs from the sideways-travelling bullet, the tissue surrounding the bullet
path will be stretched considerably from temporary cavitation. Actual damage
from the stretch of cavitation can vary from an almost explosive effect, widely
splitting a solid organ such as the liver, or a hollow one such as the bladder
if it is full at the time it is hit, to almost no observable effect if the
hollow organs (such as intestines) when hit contain little liquid and/or air.
The exit wound may be punctate or oblong, depending on the bullet's orientation
as it struck the abdominal wall at the exit point. The exit wound could be stellate
if sufficient wounding potential remains at this point on the bullet path. The
thigh entrance wound will be small and punctate but the exit wound will
probably be stellate, measuring up to 11 cm from the tips of opposing splits.
The stellate exit wound results from the temporary cavity simply stretching the
skin beyond its breaking point. These stellate wounds generally bleed very
little. Small-to medium-sized vessels are certainly cut or torn, but the
temporary cavity tearing action generally stimulates the tiny muscles in the
vessel walls to constrict and clots will form in their open ends, limiting
blood loss. Being wide open, these wounds tend to drain and heal amazingly well
even in situations of limited surgical resources. This increased tissue disruption
of the leg will, of course, temporarily limit the mobility of the person hit to
a greater extent than wounds causing less tissue disruption. </p>

<p style='margin-right:12.0pt;margin-left:12.0pt;text-align:justify'>Soviet
5.45x39mm - This is fired from the AK-74, which is the Soviet contribution to
the new generation of smaller-calibre assault rifles and which produces the
wound profile seen in Fig. 3. The full metal-jacketed bullet designed for this
weapon has a copper-plated steel jacket and a largely steel core, as does the
bullet of its predecessor, the AK-47. A unique design feature of the AK-74,
however, is an air-space (about 5mm long) inside the jacket at the bullet's tip
(Fig 1). The speculation that this air-space would cause bullet deformation and
fragmentation on impact proved to be unfounded, but the air-space does serve to
shift the builet's centre of mass toward the rear, possibly contributing to its
very early yaw. In addition, on bullet impact with tissue, the lead just behind
the air-space shifts forward into this space. This shift of lead occurs asymmetrically
and may be one reason for the peculiar curvature of this bullet's path in the
last half of its path through tissue (Fig 3). Only in a shot with a long tissue
path, like an oblique shot through the torso, would this curved path be
evident; it doesn't really add anything to wounding capacity, but might cause
an occasional confusing path through tissue. This bullet yaws after only about
7cm of tissue penetration, assuring an increased temporary cavity stretch
disruption in a higher percentage of extremity hits; other bullets need more
tissue depth to yaw and in many cases cause only minimal disruption on
extremity hits. </p>

<p style='margin-right:12.0pt;margin-left:12.0pt;text-align:justify'>The
abdomen and thigh wounds expected from this bullet would be essentially the
same as those described above for the Yugoslav variation of the AK-47 bullet. </p>

<p style='margin-right:12.0pt;margin-left:12.0pt;text-align:justify'>All
pointed bullets that do not deform end their tissue path travelling base first,
since this puts their centre of mass forward; this is their stable attitude.
The rotation imparted to the bullet by the rifled gun barrel is sufficient to
force the bullet to travel point-forward in air (in properly designed weapons),
but not in tissue where such factors as bullet shape and the location of centre
of mass far outweigh rotation effects. The bi-lobed yaw patterns shown in the
profiles of the AK-47 and the AK-74 represent what is seen in most shots.
Sometimes the bullet yaws to 180°, or the base-forward position, in one cycle.
These variations, along with the curvature in bullet path at or near the end of
tissue path, are of far less importance than the distance the bullet travels
point-forward before significant yaw begins. </p>

<p style='margin-right:12.0pt;margin-left:12.0pt;text-align:justify'>US M193
5.56x45mm - This bullet is fired from the US armed forces' first-generation
smaller-calibre rifle, the M16A1. The large permanent cavity it produces, shown
in the wound profile (Fig. 4), was observed by surgeons who served in Vietnam,
but the tissue disruption mechanism responsible was not clear until the
importance of bullet fragmentation as a cause of tissue disruption was worked
out and described. As shown on the wound profile, this full-metal-jacketed
bullet travels point-forward in tissue for about 12cm after which it yaws to
90°, flattens, and breaks at the cannelure (groove around bullet midsection
into which the cartridge neck is crimped). The bullet point flattens but
remains in one piece, retaining about 60 per cent of the original bullet
weight. The rear portion breaks into many fragments that penetrate up to 7cm
radially from the bullet path. The temporary cavity stretch, its effect
increased by perforation and weakening of the tissue by fragments, then causes
a much enlarged permanent cavity by detaching tissue pieces. The degree of
bullet fragmentation decreases with increased shooting distance (as striking
velocity decreases), as shown in Fig. 5. At a shooting distance over about 100m
the bullet breaks at the cannelure, forming two large fragments and, at over
200m, it no longer breaks, although it continues to flatten somewhat, until
400m. This consistent change in deformation/fragmentation pattern has an
important forensic application. It can be used to estimate shooting distance if
the bullet is recovered in the body and has penetrated only soft tissue. </p>

<p style='margin-right:12.0pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:12.0pt'>The
effects of this bullet in the abdomen shot will show the temporary cavity
effects as described for the Yugoslav AK-47 and, in addition, there will be an
increased tissue disruption from the synergistic effect of temporary cavitation
acting on tissue that has been weakened by bullet fragmentation. Instead of
finding a hole consistent with the size of the bullet in hollow organs such as
the intestine, we typically find a hole left by missing tissue of up to 7cm in
diameter (see permanent cavity in Fig. 4). The thigh entrance wound will be
small and punctuate. The first part of the tissue path will show minimal
disruption. The exit will vary from the small punctuate hole described for the
Soviet AK-47 to the stellate exit described for the Yugoslav AK-47, depending
on how thick the thigh is where the bullet perforates it. In a sufficiently
thick thigh, the M193 bullet fragmentation is also likely to cause a
significant loss of tissue and possibly one or more small exit wounds near the
large stellate one. <br>

rifle is replacing the M193 bullet shot from the M16A1 as the standard bullet
of the US armed forces. FN Herstal originally developed this bullet type (which
has a steel &quot;penetrator&quot; as the forward part of its core - Fig. 1)
designating its bullet the SS109. The wound profile (Fig. 6) is very similar to
that produced by the M 193 bullet. Although the SS109 and the M855 are not the
same bullet, their differences are small and one almost needs a magnifying
glass and a side-by-side comparison to differentiate the two. There is little
difference in their performance in tissue. </p>

<p style='margin-right:12.0pt;margin-left:12.0pt;text-align:justify'>The
abdominal and the thigh wound produced by the M855 or the SS109 bullets would
be essentially the same as those described above for the M16A1 M193 bullet. </p>

<p style='margin-right:12.0pt;margin-left:12.0pt;text-align:justify'>The longer
5.56mm bullets (M855, SS109) need a higher rotational velocity to maintain
stabilisation in air. FN claimed that this faster rotation also causes the
SS109 to have a significantly longer path in tissue before marked yaw occurs,
thus producing wounds of less severity. This is simply untrue (compare Fig. 6
with Fig. 6). Additional rotation beyond that needed to keep the bullet
straight in air appears to have little or no effect on the projectile's
behaviour in tissue. However, there is a situation concerning rotation rates
whereby these longer 5.66mm bullets can cause increased wound severity.
Shooting the SS109 or M855 bullet in the older M16A1 rifle barrel (they are not
intended for use in this 1-in- 12 in twist barrel, but in the newer M 16A2
1-in-7in twist) produces a bullet spin rate insufficient to stabilise the
longer bullets. Such a bullet will yaw up to 70° in its path through air.
Striking at this high yaw angle (essentially travelling sideways), these
bullets break on contact and the marked fragmentation, acting in synergy with
the temporary cavity stretch, causes a large (over 15cm) stellate wound with
the loss of considerable tissue (Fackler, M.L., unpublished data, 1988). </p>

<p style='margin-right:12.0pt;margin-left:12.0pt;text-align:justify'>NATO
7.62x51mm FMJ (US version) - This full-metal-jacketed military bullets wound
profile (Fig. 7) shows the characteristic behaviour in tissue observed in all
non-deforming pointed bullets. It yaws first through 90° and then, after
reaching the base-forward position continues the rest of its path with little
or no yaw. </p>

<p style='margin-right:12.0pt;margin-left:12.0pt;text-align:justify'>The
uncomplicated thigh wound might show very minimal tissue disruption since the
streamlined bullet tends to travel point forward during the first 16cm of its
tissue path. The abdominal wound, with a sufficiently long path so that the
bullet will yaw, causing the large temporary cavity that is seen at depths of
20 to 35cm, would be expected to be very disruptive. If the bullet path is such
that this temporary cavity occurs in the liver, this amount of tissue
disruption is likely to make survival improbable. </p>

Figure 8. German 7.62 x 51 mm FMJ NATO left, same american right</p>

<p style='margin-right:12.0pt;margin-left:12.0pt;text-align:justify'>The design
standards for ammunition that can be called &quot;NATO&quot; ammunition do not
specify bullet jacket material or jacket thickness. The construction of the
West German 7.62 mm NATO bullet differs from the US 7.62 mm NATO round in that,
the jacket material is copper plated steel, whereas the US version is copper
(or the so called gilding metal alloy, which is predominantly copper). The West
German steel jacket is about 0.6mm thick near the cannelure and the US copper
jacket is about 0.8mm thick at the same point. This design difference is
responsible for a vast difference in performance in tissue. The German bullet,
after travelling point-forward for only about 8 cm, yaws and breaks at the
cannelure. The flattened point section retains only about 66 % of the bullet's
weight, the remaining 45 % mass becomes fragments (Fig. 8). The wound profile
can be described as an enlarged M16 profile (Fig. 3), with dimensions of the
tissue disruption increased by 60 % (temporary stress cavity about 22 cm
diameter; permanent crush cavity about 11 cm diameter, penetration depth of the
bullet point about 58 cm). The uncomplicated thigh wound from this bullet is
likely to have a large exit with the loss of substantial tissue near the exit;
still, this might not be a very serious wound since the bullet fragmentation
does not occur until beyond 10 cm penetration depth and, in most shots, the
bullet will have passed well beyond the major vessels before this occurs. The
abdomen shot, however, because of the much enlarged permanent cavity from
bullet fragmentation, is likely to prove fatal in a majority of cases. </p>

<p style='margin-right:12.0pt;margin-left:12.0pt;text-align:justify'>Soviet and
Chinese 7.62 x 51 mm R (Rimmed case) - This bullet, although not nearly as
common as the AK-47 or the others discussed above, is included because it is
currently used in the Dragunov sniper rifle and the Communist bloc light
machine-guns. Also, since it was the standard Soviet military round in WW1 and
WW2 (in the bolt-action Mosin-Nagant), it might well be found in considerable
numbers in some Third World countries. The bullet weighs 9,6 g; the base is
hollowed out with a cone-shaped cavity - 5 mm deep for the Sovjet, 3 mm deep
for the Chinese). The Sovjet bullet has a copper-plated steel jacket and the
Chinese one has a jacket of what appears to be brass. The muzzle velocity is
about 853 m/s and the wound profile closely resembles that of the 7.62 mm NATO
(US version). Thigh and abdominal shots thus would be as described above for
the US 7.62 mm NATO bullet. </p>
