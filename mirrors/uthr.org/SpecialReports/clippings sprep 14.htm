<p><b><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>COLOMBO, July 29 (AFP)</span></b><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'> 
  - A Scandinavian force monitoring a truce between Sri Lanka's government and 
  Tamil Tiger rebels Monday admonished the guerrillas over their recruitment of 
  child soldiers.</span></p>
<p><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission 
  in a statement expressed hope that the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) 
  &quot;live up to the expectations for just governance and responsibility as 
  regards child recruitment.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In May 1998, the LTTE leadership 
  told the United Nations it would not use children under 18 in combat.</span></p>
<p><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But the monitors on July 8 had 
  said they had received 44 complaints that the LTTE had forcibly conscripted 
  or recruited children into their ranks since a ceasefire went into effect February 
  23.</span></p>
<p><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The monitors' statement came after 
  a Sri Lankan human rights group accused the mission of failing to secure the 
  release of a single child recruit from the Tigers.</span></p>
<p><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The mission is &quot;in part responsible 
  for misjudgements that have enabled the LTTE to widen the scope of child conscription 
  under the cover of peace&quot;, University Teachers for Human Rights said last 
  week.</span></p>
<p><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The Sri Lankan government on Saturday 
  held its first ministerial-level talks with the Tigers under the ceasefire, 
  at a meeting in London. The two sides are expected to hold formal negotiations 
  in late August or September in Thailand.</span></p>
<p><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The monitors said the Norwegian-brokered

<h3><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sri Lanka 's Tamil rebels accused 
  of recruiting children as soldiers amid truce</span> </h3>
<p><b>Associated Press,</b> <i>Mon July 22, 2002 10:50 EDT .</i> SHIMALI SENANAYAKE 
  - Associated Press Writer - COLOMBO, Sri Lanka - (AP) A Sri Lankan human rights 
  group on Monday accused Tamil rebels of using a cease-fire to forcibly recruit 
  children as soldiers and criticized Norway-led truce monitors for not doing 
  enough to stop the practice. The group, founded by teachers in the Tamil heartland 
  of Jaffna in 1998, keeps track of the human rights situation in Sri Lanka - 
  's north and east. </p>
<p><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It went on to accuse European truce 
  monitors of being ``in part responsible for misjudgments that have enabled the 
  LTT (or Liberation Tigers of Tamileelam) to widen the scope of child conscription 
  under the cover of peace.'' </span></p>
<p><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But Teitur Torkelsson, spokesman 
  for the European mission overseeing a Feb. 22 cease-fire between the government 
  and rebels, said ``under the truce agreement the monitors have no authority 
  to punish or take action against those found guilty of forcibly recruiting children.'' 
  </span></p>
<p><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>``We record at least two complaints 
  daily of forcible recruitment of children. ... It has been the most common complaint,'' 
  Torkelsson said. </span></p>
<p><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Children are being forced to join 
  the Tamil Tigers mostly in eastern areas like Ampara and Batticaloa, he said. 
  </span></p>
<p><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There was no immediate response 
  from the rebels. </span></p>
<p><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The Tamil Tigers have been fighting 
  since 1983 for a separate homeland, saying Sri Lanka - 's 3.2 million minority 
  Tamils are being discriminated against by the majority Sinhalese. </span></p>
<p><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>More than 64,500 people have died 
  in the 19-year conflict. </span></p>
<p><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Human rights groups and the government 
  have often accused the Tamil Tigers of forcing families to send their children 
  to join the rebel ranks. </span></p>
<p><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>An Amnesty International team that 
  visited Sri Lanka - last month also accused the insurgents of using children 
  as guerrillas, despite a pledge made to U.N. Undersecretary-General Olara Otunnu 
  in 1998. Otunnu is expected to visit the island next month. </span></p>

<h3>UTHR slams LTTE for child conscription </h3>
<p><b>Frederica Jansz in Colombo,</b> <i>9.45 a.m. SLT Monday July 22.</i> Hot 
  on the heels of a group of sea Tigers abducting two Scandinavian born ceasefire 
  monitors, the Jaffna University Teachers Human Rights organization has made 
  public another, hard-hitting report which severely criticizes the Tigers for 
  continuing to abduct and conscript children to their armed cadre. </p>
<p><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>As a result of these incidents 
  of forced conscription, this report asserts, the confidence the Tamil people 
  living in Sri Lanka's north and east had in the LTTE is severely dented. The 
  report has come out a month ahead of the visit of Olara Otunnu, the UN's Special 
  Rapporteur for Children and Armed Conflict, who, is scheduled to visit Sri Lanka 
  in August. </span></p>
<p><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>During Ottunu's last visit to Sri 
  Lanka in 1998, the Tigers promised him they would refrain from forcing children 
  to join their rebel outfit. </span></p>
<p><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Scandinavian born ceasefire monitors 
  too confirmed that many Tamil parents visit their offices in the Island's north 
  and east begging them to intervene and bring their children back to them after 
  they have been kidnapped by the LTTE. </span></p>
<p><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The Sri Lanka Army's Security Forces 
  Commander for Jaffna, Major General Sarath Fonseka reiterated to 'Lacnet' that 
  the forced conscription of children by the LTTE is continuing on a large scale. 
  He said, he is besieged by, Tamil parents who weep at his feet, begging the 
  army to somehow secure the release of their children from the grip of the Tigers. 
  </span></p>
<p><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The Sri Lanka government appears 
  to be avoiding addressing this issue publicly and has so far refrained from 
  doing so apparently accepting the Tigers statements in this regard that they 
  have stopped recruiting cadre below 18 years of age. </span></p>
<p><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The Jaffna Teachers for Human Rights 
  in its report released on Saturday July 20,2002, have also slammed the Sri Lankan 
  and the Norwegian Government for treating this issue with kid gloves. </span></p>
<p><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Meanwhile, opposition parliamentarians 
  have also begun to voice their suspicion that the LTTE are misleading the government 
  of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe while seriously violating terms and conditions 
  in the Ceasefire Agreement. </span></p>
<p><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Shantha Premaratne Member of Parliament 
  for the main opposition Peoples Alliance confided that the PA is, &quot;deeply 
  worried the Tigers are only buying time to establish an administrative state 
  in Sri Lanka's northern peninsula before pulling the rug from beneath the feet 
  of the government.&quot; </span></p>
<p><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Tiger Chief Vellupillai Prabhakaran 
  appears to be already creating a shadow Tamil state, separate to that of the 
  Sri Lankan Government. Last week the LTTE placed newspaper advertisements in 
  Jaffna, calling for Tamil people to apply to the Tigers police force. </span></p>
<p><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The rebel outfit has also increased 
  its political activity in the country's north and east. The LTTE now runs its 
  own bus service along the A9 highway and openly taxes travellers and residents 
  of the north and east, maintaining the money is necessary for the LTTE to smoothly 
  run its operation. </span></p>

  on child soldiers</span></h3>
<p> Young Tamils in refugee camps are most at risk</p>
<p><b>By Frances Harrison </b><br>
  BBC correspondent in Colombo </p>
<p><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The United Nations children's agency 
  says it has received fresh assurances from Tamil Tiger separatists in Sri Lanka 
  that they will not recruit children under the age of 18. </span></p>
<p><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Human rights groups have repeatedly 
  accused the Tigers of recruiting boys and girls as young as 12. </span></p>
<p><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'> </span><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Unicef 
  says it has managed to get more than 60 demobilised throughout the last year. 
  </span></p>
<p><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This is by no means the first time 
  the Tamil Tigers have promised not to recruit child soldiers. </span></p>
<p><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Four years ago, the rebels promised 
  the UN special representative for children and armed conflict they would not 
  recruit anyone under the age of 17. </span></p>
<p><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But at the end of last year, for 
  example, human rights groups like Amnesty International, said the Tigers had 
  recruited several hundred children in just a few months, sometimes using coercion. 
  </span></p>
<p><b><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>World watching</span></b><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'> </span></p>
<p><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>What is different about this renewed 
  commitment by the Tigers is that for the first time in years, outsiders now

<p>A human rights group in Sri Lanka says the ceasefire between the government 
  and Tamil Tiger separatists is allowing the rebels to forcibly recruit more 
  child soldiers, despite the Tigers' promise not to use underage combatants. 
</p>
<p><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The University Teachers for Human 
  Rights group said in a report, that the five-month cessation of violence had 
  enabled Tiger guerillas to enter previously inaccessible urban areas. </span></p>
<p><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The report said that rebels were 
  frequently demanding one child from each household, particularly in the eastern 
  Batticaloa region. </span></p>
<p><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The Tamil Tigers have repeatedly 
  denied the use of child soldiers, and assured the United Nations Children's 
  Fund last month that no one under the age of 18 would be recruited. </span></p>
<p><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The human rights group, Amnesty 
  International, has warned that the forcible recruitment of children has continued 
  despite the ceasefire, and called for more to be done to stop the practice.

<p><span style='color:black'>COLOMBO: In yet another damning indictment of the 
  Liberation Tigers, a human rights group of Tamil university teachers has reported 
  on extensive conscription of children in eastern Sri Lanka, rampant extortion 
  from the people and use of terror against Muslims.</span></p>
<p><span style='color:black'>The University Teachers for Human Rights (UTHR-Jaffna), 
  in its latest report released on Saturday, chronicled continuing instances of 
  children being whisked away from homes, schools and temples by LTTE recruiters. 
  </span></p>
<p><span style='color:black'>It spoke of more attempts by these involuntary recruits 
  to escape, resulting in &quot;brutal punishment&quot; and, in the case of a 
  few, death by torture. The group noticed a spurt in child conscription, contrary 
  to LTTE's assurances to the global community and to Amnesty International last 
  month.</span></p>
<p><span style='color:black'>The arrival of LTTE intelligence chief Pottu Amman, 
  wanted by India along with V Prabhakaran for Rajiv Gandhi's assassination, in 
  Batticaloa district on April 24, has given a big thrust to the conscription 
  drive, it said. </span></p>
<p><span style='color:black'>&quot;The mounting problem of escaping conscripts 
  makes a cruel mockery of LTTE's claim to be a people's movement or the people's 
  sole representatives,&quot; it said adding LTTE's measures against escapees 
  are becoming markedly more harsh and cruel.</span></p>
<p><span style='color:black'>The UTHR report assailed the Government and Norwegian 
  peace facilitators for pursuing a &quot;crude&quot; peace process, with no commitment 
  to justice and truth, and criticised the Scandinavian ceasefire monitoring mission 
  for not doing enough to address mounting human rights concerns. </span></p>
<p><span style='color:black'>Olara Otunnu, UN Special Representative for Children 
  and Armed Conflict, who extracted a promise from LTTE they would not use children 
  in combat, is due here next month.</span></p>

<h3>LTTE spy chief blamed for recruiting child soldiers</h3>

&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>COLOMBO: A Sri Lankan rights group has charged Pottu 
  Amman, a Tamil Tiger guerrilla wanted in India, with conscripting children in 
  the east despite a Norwegian-monitored truce.<br>
  <br>
  The University Teachers for Human Rights (UTHR) said Pottu Amman was spearheading 
  a campaign in the island's Batticaloa region to swell the ranks of the group 
  with youngsters of 16 and below.<br>
  <br>
  Pottu Amman is the feared intelligence chief of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil 
  Eelam (LTTE), which seeks a homeland for the Tamils in Sri Lanka's north and 
  east.<br>
  <br>
  Both Pottu Amman - which is a nom de guerre -- and LTTE chief Velupillai Prabhakaran 
  are wanted in India for the 1991 assassination of former prime minister Rajiv 
  Gandhi by a woman suicide bomber.<br>
  <br>
  Following Pottu Amman's arrival in Batticaloa in late April, there has been 
  a sharp increase in conscription,&quot; the report said. &quot;Once more... 
  there are press gangs visiting schools and villages and hauling away screaming 
  children in tractor-trailers.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  Media reports said he had crossed from the north of the island to the east in 
  April under the cover of the truce deal which allows rebels freedom to move 
  into areas in the government's control.<br>
  <br>
  &quot;The presence of Pottu Amman (in the east) makes it abundantly clear that 
  conscription is being orchestrated from the top,&quot; the UTHR alleged. Pottu 
  Amman is among the few in the LTTE who take orders directly from Prabhakaran.<br>
  <br>
  The accusations come ahead of a visit in the next few weeks by Olara Otunnu, 
  the U.N.'s Special Representative for Children in Armed Conflict.<br>
  <br>
  The report describes the trauma of hundreds of children torn from their families 
  and holed up in rebel training camps.<br>
  <br>
  &quot;In the camp there were children in the age group 12-14 years under training. 
  Those who express feelings of missing home or wanting their mother are mercilessly 
  beaten.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  The UTHR, which is headed by a Tamil, said some children had been killed during 
  live firing exercises and their bodies buried. &quot;They are understood as 
  having the status of 'martyrs'!&quot;<br>
  <br>
  The defence ministry has been reporting lately that children escaping from the 
  Tigers have sought shelter in police stations and military camps.<br>
  <br>
  Last month, six girls, aged between 13 and 14 years, fled a Tiger training camp 
  and turned themselves in to police in Sittanday in Batticaloa. They claimed 
  they were among 80 child soldiers being trained for combat, police said.<br>
  <br>
  Unicef and Amnesty International, the London-based rights watchdog, have repeatedly 
  lambasted the LTTE for breaking a pledge given to Otunnu in 1998 to halt the 
  conscription of children.<br>
  <br>
  In its report, the group has also slammed foreign monitors supervising the landmark 
  truce between the government and the LTTE that was concluded in February.<br>
  <br>
  The truce, arranged by broker Norway, is part of confidence-building measures 
  taken to smooth the way ahead of peace talks with the guerrillas who have been 
  fighting for nearly two decades for a separate state. About 60,000 people have 
  died in the conflict.<br>
  <br>
  &quot;The credibility of the peace process hinges on the issue of child conscription 
  because all that is palpably going wrong is intimately linked to it,&quot; the 
  UTHR said.<br>
  <br>
  &quot;The strength of the Norwegian role lies in a realisation by the LTTE that 
  it is in a hostile international climate with limited options,&quot; it said, 
  saying Oslo should specifically prohibit child recruitment in the truce deal.</span><span
