    May 1983: When Majesty Stoops to Folly</span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText align=center style='text-align:center'>- The Beginnings of
    Mass Mobilisation for the Tamil Militancy</p>
  <p>For many Tamil students the violence at Peradeniya
    University in May 1983 was a greater factor in their radicalisation than the
    more sensationally brutal events of July, which quickly overshadowed it.
    Peradeniya was the country’s premier institution of higher learning. When
    Sinhalese students with UNP leanings attacked fellow Tamil students on three
    consecutive days in May; the authorities and the country’s leading intellects
    did little to stop it. The excellent report of the committee of inquiry chaired
    by Kenneth de Lanerolle (discussed at length in UTHR publication <i>Sri Lanka:
    ‘Arrogance of Power:<span style='color:#FF9966'> </span>Myths, Decadence &amp;
    Murder</i>) created controversy because many thought it went too far.  We would argue that good as it was, the
    report still did not go far enough. </p>
  <p>The recently obtained testimonies below suggest that the
    report did not touch the rot that was at the root of the problem. There is
    evidence to suggest that violence was not merely the result of passive
    acceptance by the administrative and academic establishments, but of their
    active complicity in the actual direction of events. The punishments it
    recommended against identified offenders were not implemented and the report
    itself was suppressed.</p>
  <h4>Bala’s Ordeal</h4>
  <p>The main attacks on students on the 11<sup>th</sup> night
    took place almost simultaneously at Hilda Obeysekere Hall (HOH), James Peiris
    Hall (JPH) and Marrs Hall (MH). HOH was attacked about 9.45 PM by students
    armed with staves and parts of furniture. They were from other halls looking
    for particular students, some of whom were pointed out by fellow Sinhalese
    students. A particular target being out called by the mob was first year
    engineering student P. Balasooriyan who was editing a Tamil magazine and was
    accused of being a 'tiger'. What follows is his testimony:</p>
  <p>Unknown to Balasooriyan, 4 issues of the magazine ‘<i>Puthusu</i>’
    (<i>New</i>) he was co-editing had arrived by post the same day and had been
    removed from the letter board and opened. The cover had the picture of a dove
    in a cage chained to a large metal ball. The picture was inspired by those
    commonly used then in Amnesty International publications campaigning for the
    release of political prisoners. That was enough to make Balasooriyan a ‘tiger’
    although the political line of the magazine was sharply critical of the LTTE
    and its methods.</p>
  <p>Sensing danger, Balasooriyan left his room and went to the
    room of Thayaparan, also on the first floor, where one bed was vacant. At this
    point Balasooriyan saw over the balcony the intruders searching his room in the
    wing across. The intruders came in and asked for their names. Balasooriyan gave
    the name of Appathurai Mohan. The intruders saw a Milk White calendar with a
    picture of Mahatma Gandhi on the wall and forced the two inmates to eat it.
    They went away and failing to locate their prey, came back asking for student
    record books. Balasooriyan said that he was a first year who came late, and had
    not got one yet. The mob started beating Tamil students. His fellow Tamil
    students who were protecting Balasooriyan felt this could not go on long and
    advised him to escape. He ran along the wing’s corridor and jumped one floor
    down at the Mahaveli River end. He was spotted and a cry went out. Lying on the
    ground, he found a torch flashing on him within 5 minutes. He was taken upstairs.
    He told the mob of 25 to 50 that he was asthmatic and frightened and that was
    why he jumped out. He denied he was Balasooriyan and gave Thayaparan’s as his
    room. The mob took him there, gave him water, asked him to lie down on the bed,
    switched off the lights and went away.</p>
  <p>15 minutes later there was a huge rumble, the mob came again
    and knocked at the door, which Thayaparan opened. Balasooriyan sat up and
    blinked as the light came on. Asked for his name, he repeated Appathurai Mohan.
    The mob called, “<i>Bandara, come here</i>”. Bandara was a Sinhalese batch-mate
    in Balasooriyan’s engineering practical group assigned in alphabetical order.
    Asked if this was Balasooriyan, Bandara agreed.</p>
  <p>The mob took Balasooriyan to an open (long) balcony
    connecting the wings and began assaulting him with broken legs of chairs and
    other physical means as he lay prostrate in his sarong. This went on for half
    an hour with Sinhalese students watching. A number of their faces clearly
    displayed disapproval and others urged the attackers, without success, to stop.
    The student who was most violent and unrelenting in attacking Balasooriyan was
    his own batch-mate, W.M.V. Fernando.  </p>
  <p>The time was past mid-night and the huge racket had been
    going on for above three hours without any intervention by the authorities
    until the warden, Dr. K.N.O. Dharmadasa (now professor of Sinhalese), arrived.
    The mob made room for him to advance along the corridor. He asked the others to
    stop beating the victim and that he would take over. Dharmadasa took Balasooriyan
    gently by the hand as if to reassure him and led him to his office.</p>
  <h4>It’s a Bomb!</h4>
  <p>Balasooriyan was astonished to find that all the printed
    matter and private letters in his room had been neatly arranged in Dharmadasa’s
    office and it was about 1.00 AM. Among these were Palestinian poems translated
    by Dr. M.A.M. Nuhman (Linguistics), <i>Letter to a Sinhalese Soldier</i> attributed to the then famous political prisoner Nirmala Nithyanandan and
    widely circulated among Tamils, and pamphlets issued by almost all the militant
    groups in Jaffna. There were also the four issues of the magazine <i>Puthusu</i> which Balasooriyan discovered for the very first time had arrived for him by
    post. Dharmadasa pointed to the cover of <i>Puthusu</i> and asked him what was
    on the cover. Balasooriyan explained in his then unfamiliar English pointing
    one by one to the cage, the pigeon, chain and iron ball. Dharmadasa suggested
    dramatically, “It’s a bomb.”</p>
  <p>It struck Balasooriyan that during the rioting that had
    preceded Dharmadasa taking him by the hand, the belongings of his room had been
    systematically rifled and brought to the warden’s office. The copies of the <i>Puthusu</i>,
    which Balasooriyan had not seen before, had been intercepted and almost
    certainly given to Dharmadasa in advance, leaving the warden pondering over the
    enigmatic cover while the riot was on around him.</p>
  <p>The dove in a cage manacled to an iron ball was part of the
    imagery popularised at that time (early 1980s) by the worldwide movement for
    the rights of political prisoners, which was triggered by a convergence of a
    number of public events: The campaign by the Mothers of Plaza de Mayo in
    Argentina, the murder in 1980 by US-trained death squads of Archbishop Oscar
    Romero in El Salvador and the ongoing repression by Western-backed regimes in
    East Timor and Chile. Amnesty International had by then recorded about a score
    of disappearances in custody of Tamil political prisoners.  While Tamil activists were circulating these
    images as part of their political mobilisation, most educated Sinhalese and the
    Colombo media angrily branded Amnesty International an agent of terrorist
    propaganda. The two communities in the small island were continents apart, not
    least in Peradeniya.  </p>
  <p>Dharmadasa questioned Balasooriyan closely on who sent the magazines
    and notices, all the time probing his links to the LTTE. Balasooriyan was
    afraid of naming his friends in Jaffna who kept him posted with literature for
    his work as co-editor of <i>Puthusu</i> and said that his father had sent the
    magazines and that leaflets were routinely posted by all the groups to the
    Press, writers and analysts. He added that Dr. Sivasegaram who taught at the
    Engineering Faculty knew him well. Dharmadasa telephoned Sivasegaram. At this
    point a JVP youth called Ranjit Gunaratnam who spoke Tamil came in and inquired
    after his well-being. </p>
  <p>Dharmadasa, looking very severe, took Balasooriyan to
    Sivasegaram’s house in a university vehicle. Prof. Thillainathan (Tamil) and Dr.
    Kasinadar (Philosophy) were also there. The three Tamil academics had spoken to
    the Vice Chancellor Prof. B.L. Panditharatne and tried to explain that they
    knew Balasooriyan through his literary interests and that the material he
    possessed was for a bona fide purpose. The Vice Chancellor maintained that the
    matter had gone to the CID 4<sup>th</sup> Floor independently of him and he had
    no alternative but to hand Balasooriyan over to the Police.</p>
  <p>Balasooriyan expressed the fear that policemen irritated at
    being woken up from their sleep are likely to take it out on him. They went to
    the Vice Chancellor’s place in the jeep. The VC said that Balasooriyan could
    spend the night in the custody of the University Marshal (whose office had done
    absolutely nothing to protect the Tamils) and be handed over to the Police in
    the morning. He also gave an assurance that Balasooriyan would not be beaten;
    an assurance he should have known was worthless.</p>
  <p>Sivasegaram then felt that even the Marshal’s men might beat
    him and decided that he would stay the night with him. Being bare bodied in a
    sarong, Balasooriyan was taken to his room to change into trousers, shirt and
    collect his Bata slippers. His things were in a mess and Rs.96 he had for the
    week’s expenses had been robbed. He told his roommate to inform his parents. It
    was 4.00 AM when they reached the Marshal’s office. Both frightened and tired,
    Balasooriyan began to nod off. Sivasegaram who sat across asked him to sleep
    and stayed awake, an act of kindness Balasooriyan said he could never forget.</p>
  <h4>Government Hospitality</h4>
  <p>At the Kandy Police station (Wednesday 12<sup>th</sup>)
    Balasooriyan was placed in a cell 2ft. by 4 or 5 ft. and taken out to the
    toilet at the back of the station near the railway tracks. He was told that the
    CID could not come from Colombo until the next day. About 11.00 PM a police
    officer asked him who sent the notices. He was beaten when he said that he did
    not know. A CID party from Colombo took him by jeep to Kotahena police station
    in Colombo where he arrived at 7.00 PM on the 13<sup>th</sup>, this time to a
    longer cell with a toilet behind.</p>
  <p>Next day on the CID 4<sup>th</sup> Floor, a man tried to
    scare him by telling him that Kuttimani was tortured there and there is blood
    on the floor and he must tell the truth. During the interrogation lasting 2 to
    3 hours, all his materials from Dharmadasa’s office were placed before him. The
    Muslim translator struck him as sympathetic. They seemed very concerned with
    Nirmala’s letter to a Sinhalese soldier. A hefty inspector then came in and
    asked him who sent the letters. When Balasooriyan said he did not know, the
    Inspector gave him a thundering slap and ordered him to stand bent with his
    head under the table. Later on they took him to be certified by a doctor and
    released him to his brother in law living in Colombo. This was on the 14<sup>th</sup>.</p>
  <h4><b>The University’s Complicity</b></h4>
  <p>We may point out here that Balasooriyan was handed over to
    the Police because the University authorities had decided that he was a Tiger.
    The reason given by Vice Chancellor that he had no alternative because
    Balasooriyan’s name had already gone to the CID was so patently absurd that it
    was not repeated before the Lanerolle Committee. In fact the Lanerolle Report
    says, “<i>A prima facie case by appropriate authorities does not appear to have
    been made against Balasooriyan before taking a very serious step of sending him
    to the Police”.</i> The Report further said:<i> “During this critical period
    what authority existed within the campus was in eclipse. Not only did the
    Security Service signally fail in its duty, but wardens and sub-wardens appear
    to have abdicated their responsibility. Here was a situation which could not be
    handled by the University's own structures. Yet were serious attempts made to
    call in the Police?....” </i></p>
  <p>The foregoing facts with the fact that it was students from
    the ruling UNP who were at the forefront of the attacks point inexorably to
    complicity on the part of the University at the highest level in the Tiger
    hunt. While giving the facts from which the reader could frame questions,
    Lanerolle avoided explicitly embarrassing the university hierarchy. Dharmadasa
    was then a middle level academic, and would very likely not have acted in such
    a highhanded manner unless he felt this is what the authorities intended him to
    do. The Report says:<i> “Dr. Dharmadasa himself admitted that their prime
    concern was to defuse the situation... Had a less hasty step been taken,
    regarding Balasooriyan, it would have saved the authorities and his 300
    accusers the ignominy of learning (later) that the 'tiger' was only an
    'unoffending cat’!”</i> This excuse was after Dharmadasa knew that his foray
    into Tiger hunting had been less than glorious.</p>
  <p>Further, the VC’s claim that the CID was anxious to question
    Balasooriyan is belied by the CID’s unenthusiastic and tardy, if not bored,
    conduct of the business. The Police would be concerned about guns, explosives
    and secret plans, but not over lots of commonplace paper that newspaper offices
    and libraries had. Contrary to the VC’s assurance that the Police would not
    beat Balasooriyan, if professors could not make anything credible of the pile
    of paper, what else could the Police do except to beat the fellow? According to
    the Report Dharmadasa had contacted the Vice Chancellor regarding Balasooriyan.
    The circumstances and the VC’s complicity suggest that someone high up in the
    University had gone to the CID.</p>
  <p>It was so light a thing for the University to send a youth
    already tortured with their complicity to be tortured again by the Police.
    Other reliable testimony, which also concerns Sivaram, tells us that the attack
    on Tamils was not a sudden fit of madness, but the University had been
    teetering towards it for some months.</p>
  <h4>Exit Sivaram</h4>
  <p>In 1982 a Tamil student from the East in the Humanities with
    no political involvement was interrupted during a lecture by a peon from the
    Dean’s office and handed over a letter. The letter typed in English was from
    the Gurunagar army camp in Jaffna asking him to come over for an inquiry.
    Having heard and read stories of torture and disappearance at the camp and the
    corpses of Inpam and Selvam dumped in public he was frightened. He remembers
    being given a white sheet of paper and the letter was not even in an envelope.
    Letters to students from the administration are normally posted on the letter
    board, not hand delivered in this manner. We may infer that the letter
    originating from Military Intelligence was addressed to the Vice Chancellor’s
    office, where it was opened and passed on to the Dean’s office for immediate
    delivery.</p>
  <p>The student thought it best not to let the matter become
    public, lest he and his family become targets of harassment. He only told his
    two elder brothers, his brother-in-law, a district judge, his Sinhalese
    roommate and his teachers Dr. Kasinadar and Rajan Kulathungam. He travelled
    overnight by bus to Jaffna and at the army camp was surprised to see another
    batch-mate from Batticaloa, who too received such a letter and was keeping
    quiet about it. </p>
  <p>The interrogation consisted of recording answers to a list
    of more than 70 questions giving all the details of his life from friends and
    family. Exhausted, he was left to sit it out as the hours fled towards
    nightfall, dreading the prospect of all the tortures he had heard about and
    wondering if he would ever go home. Meanwhile another young man made
    conversation with him trying to win his confidence. He was given his first food
    at 10.00 PM and questioned the next day. The young man who had tried to make
    conversation with him was there as translator.</p>
  <p>The translator, a Muslim, asked him if there had been a
    problem between Muslim and Tamil students. The student remembered that there
    had been a dispute between Muslim and Tamil second year males over the manner
    of each ragging of fresher girls from the other community. This particular
    student had been conspicuous in leading a campaign to stop all ragging. It
    occurred to him that there were informants in the University passing on
    information about possible ‘tigers’.</p>
  <p>The second interrogation by a colonel was under conditions when
    the exhausted student’s mind and memory were hazy. It consisted of repeating
    the same questions of the previous day and comparing the answers. There were
    inevitable discrepancies, and at each discrepancy the colonel slapped the
    student. At the end of it Brigadier Balthazar came in, apprised himself of the
    proceedings and ordered the student released. The student’s relief was
    short-lived. The Muslim translator took him and described to him the list of
    tortures they inflicted there. He told him that he must help them by keeping
    them informed of activities in the University and should he not cooperate and
    gave them occasion to pull him in again, he would not get off so lightly.</p>
  <p>The student found out later that the Batticaloa student had
    also been released. The student was not troubled again. But he has kept quiet
    about it to this day. Talking about it could also have opened him to being
    suspected an army spy. Under these circumstances one can have no idea of how
    many were summoned in this manner. Our witness, the student, said that he
    recalls having heard that Sivaram too received a letter about that time
    summoning him to Gurunagar. The only concrete indication he could cite is that
    Sivaram dropped out of the University at that time. </p>
  <p>The role of the University administration in this matter as
    an extension of the State’s security arm is unprecedented. The University was
    acting as a conduit for letters ordering students to attend torture sessions on
    account of opinions they were suspected of having. Others familiar with the
    University at that time opine that if the institution complied with such
    practices, initially at least the JVP was the main reason. The UNP government
    was then watching the JVP and using a carrot and stick approach, enticing
    selected JVPers into the UNP. National Security Minister Lalith Athulathmudali
    was a leading exponent of this policy. </p>
  <p>Instead of a place where ideas are challenged and critically
    evaluated, the University had taken to policing ideas and opinions as an
    instrument of UNP party policy. The attacks on Tamils in May logically flowed
    from this approach. It was not a flash in the pan; it went unchecked by the
    authorities for three successive days with complete impunity. </p>
  <p>The fact that the University suppressed the report of the
    committee appointed by them and took no action to punish the 10 students
    identified among the miscreants, is itself a strong indication of complicity.
    What’s more, the leaders were UNPers and Balasooriyan’s ordeal suggests that
    the miscreants were not acting on their own.  </p>
  <p>In the words of the Lanerolle Report,<i> &quot;The purpose
    of the campaign was to evict the Tamils from the Campus. In complete defiance
    of authority and acting with blatant violence, the attackers succeeded in
    achieving their ends.”</i> A tragic irony confronted those who were evicted.</p>
  <h4>To Arms, Death and Disillusionment</h4>
  <p>We do not know the number of Tamil students from Peradeniya
    who joined the various militant movements in the aftermath of 1983, but the
    figure would run into several scores. More importantly, those displaced by the
    violence went into political work, particularly in Jaffna, holding pocket
    meetings and organising the fast in the University of Jaffna demanding
    Agriculture and Engineering faculties in Jaffna for the displaced students.
    These activities aided the massive recruitment into the various militant groups
    at that time. We give a small cross section of the students who joined.</p>
  <p>Among those Tamil students who left their studies at
    Peradeniya and like Sivaram joined the PLOTE were Kirupaharan alias Selvam
    (Dentistry, Sivaram’s victim), Jan Master (Medicine) and Thayaparan
    (Engineering). Balsooriyan himself, after his displacement, joined the NLFT, a
    left and largely political group, led by Visvanandadevan, and alumnus of the
    Engineering Faculty who had influenced him earlier. Another engineering student
    Paripooranabala also joined the NLFT, but had returned to complete his degree.
    Of three students<span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'> </span><span
style='color:black'>Chandrasekar (from Amparai),
    Rajakaran (Vannarponnai, Jaffna) and Vasikaran (Mannar)</span> from
    Balasooriyan’s engineering batch, the first two joined the TELO and the latter
    joined EROS. All three were trained by the Indian Army, but subsequently left
    when the atmosphere within and among militant groups became oppressive.</p>
  <p>As was quite typical of that time, although Vasikaran joined
    EROS, his elder brother Suthakaran who was a second year engineering student
    dropped out and joined the LTTE.</p>
  <p>In 1984 he was injured in the leg by Army firing. Although
    the Army did not come near him, he took cyanide and died. Local peasants, who
    found his body later, gave it to the LTTE. Paranitharan was a final year
    engineering student during the May 1983 troubles (from Badulla as another
    recalls), later joined the EROS and also completed his degree. He was killed in
    Colombo in 1986 when a bomb he was transporting exploded.</p>
  <p>Two students Kuganesan (from Atchuvely, Jaffna), a
    Peradeniya engineering second year, and Sri Sabesan (Kurumbasiddy, Jaffna), who
    was due to enter engineering at Moratuwa, were among the students who were on
    fast at the University of Jaffna. Others in the fast were the girls
    Mathivathani and Gowri, agriculture students from Peradeniya. Mathivathani was
    at Sangamitta Hall, adjoining and overlooking Hilda where Tamil students were
    riotously attacked.</p>
  <p>This was January 1984 and the fast which some of the
    organisers had recklessly called a fast to death had attracted large crowds and
    the leaders were shy to call it off. They approached various groups to kidnap
    those fasting. The groups that were politically motivated refused. Mano Master,
    a Marxist in the TELO, told the leaders that if they had told the public
    something silly, the correct thing is to admit it. (Mano from Kommathurai, a
    former science student from the University of Jaffna, was again a major figure
    at that time, whose tragedy has not been written about. Shortly after he left
    the TELO in 1984 after protesting against its internal repression, he was
    gunned down in Pt Pedro by Kittu on the LTTE leader’s orders.)</p>
  <p>The organisers of the student fast finally went to the LTTE,
    which promptly brought a van, abducted the fasting students and took them to
    India by boat. Mathivathani became the Leader’s wife and Gowri later agreed to
    join the LTTE. Kuganesan and Sri Sabesan refused to join. This recruitment by
    the LTTE was something of an anomaly tied to the abduction. Students at that
    time were politicised and the LTTE had a horror for open political discussion.
    The main groups, which had ongoing open discussions, were the PLOTE, EPRLF, EROS
    and NLFT. Many joined the PLOTE, as the students were impatient for military
    training and they thought that a short and swift campaign would bring them
    Eelam and then back to studies. </p>
  <h4>An Ill Omen</h4>
  <p>The abduction at Jaffna University, which the LTTE claimed
    was a mission of mercy to save life, has several ironies. They also point to
    the propaganda impact of the displaced students and the way the fight against
    state oppression was tragically moving.</p>
  <p>A boy of ten or eleven years who was part of the crowd at the
    fast had secretly got into the van the LTTE had brought, during the commotion
    of abducting the fasting students. Stirred to join the militants despite his
    age, he thought getting into the van was a good opportunity. The boy was
    discovered when the van conveying the abductees reached the LTTE hideout. An
    LTTE functionary radioed Prabhakaran and asked what to do with the boy. The
    Leader’s order was to kill him. The boy was shot and buried. The incident is
    well known to LTTE dissidents of that period. One of them said that the child
    was first told that he was being taken into the organisation, after his fate
    had been decided. He was then given a cigarette and asked to smoke it. The
    child was confused and asked if smoking was permitted among militants. The LTTE
    functionary concerned later began having nightmares and not long afterwards
    left the organisation. </p>
  <p>In a further irony of acting to save life, four years later
    the LTTE leader ordered his subordinate Thileepan to fast to death to score a
    political point with the Indians. The incident about the child also reveals the
    sadism of the organisation that today abducts young children. </p>
  <h4>Muhunthan</h4>
  <p>Murugamoorthy (from Vaddukottai), a dental student at
    Peradeniya, joined the TELO. Divakaran, a student of veterinary science,
    functioned as an EPRLF sympathizer and later completed his medical degree at
    Thanjavur, India. Baskaran had been a student at Colombo Hindu during the
    communal violence of 1977, when he came into contact with EROS political
    activists helping out at refugee camps in Colombo, and became politically
    involved with them. He later joined the section of EROS student activists who
    went to form the EPRLF under Pathmanabha. Baskaran was a third year agriculture
    student at Peradeniya during the 1983 troubles. Another Baskaran from
    Trincomalee who was a final year agriculture student was already involved
    politically in the PLOTE student organisation. After the 1983 incidents he
    joined the PLOTE.</p>
  <p>A figure who in the interests of future generations is
    deserving of a fuller biography is Muruganesan (popularly known as Muhunthan),
    a conscientious Marxist of whose kind any people should be proud. Muhunthan was
    an agriculture graduate from Peradeniya who joined the teaching staff of the
    faculty and taught agricultural economics. He too became displaced by the
    events of 1983. From his home in Vaddukkottai, Jaffna, he used to cycle to
    Manipay and join discussions with displaced students, including Baskaran, who
    were close to the EPRLF. He had several discussions, including the
    applicability of Marxist ideas to their situation before committing himself. He
    later received military training in India.</p>
  <p>Muhunthan was however an all-rounder as a freedom fighter.
    His heart was in ecology, sustainable agriculture and social upliftment. He
    took a keen interest in fostering local libraries, collecting books and
    materials on traditional knowledge and sustainable practices, such as
    economising on the use of water. He with some others in the EPRLF started an
    experimental plot in Jaffna. They also organised a protest against caste
    oppression in Siruppiddy and secured better wages for the women. This outlook
    was common among several left, rather than nationalist, groups from the late
    1960s.</p>
  <p>Among others who joined in these activities were Ahilan and
    Rajkumar who had completed their A. Levels at Royal College, Colombo, and their
    friend Bala from Hindu College, Colombo. Several of these boys from Colombo had
    joined the GUES (forerunner of the EPRLF) while doing cyclone relief work in Batticaloa
    in 1978. </p>
  <p>As a freedom fighter, Muhunthan lived very simply like the
    ordinary cadres and kept only two sets of clothes. No longer able to fulfill
    the social expectations of a professional man, he felt obliged to break his
    engagement to his fiancée whom he knew from university. Unlike other leaders,
    particularly from other large groups who walked into shops and demanded the
    best, he went to the market and negotiated with the vendors for vegetables
    going bad.</p>
  <p>His organisation was thrown off balance after being attacked
    and banned by the LTTE in 1986, and scores killed under detention. When it
    returned in 1988 after the Indian Army established control, many of the cadres
    acted from motives of revenge and killings became rampant on both sides. Under the
    EPRLF-dominated North-East Provincial Council, Muhunthan was posted to Jaffna
    as co-ordinator and given a room at the Jaffna Secretariat. At this time the
    behaviour of cadres was as particularly bad in the Jaffna town and
    Maruthanamadam camps. He identified Subathiran and Elango as persons to support
    him in a programme of reform and ordered that the weapons be placed under
    central control. He further tried to introduce norms for dealing with people,
    as became freedom fighters rather than ruffians.</p>
  <p>Things turned topsy turvy with President Premadasa’s
    appeasement of the LTTE and the Indian Army’s pull-out in early 1990. Muhunthan
    could have left for India from Trincomalee in safety, but he went to Jaffna to
    see to the evacuation of EPRLF cadres and their families and left by boat with
    the last among them. His boat was apprehended at sea by the LTTE, which then
    had the full backing of the Sri Lankan Navy. He failed in his attempt to shoot
    himself. He was last seen at the LTTE’s infamous Thunukkai torture centre.
    Muhunthan who dedicated himself selflessly for the freedom and dignity of his
    people, lost everything, and did not realise any happiness in return.</p>
  <p>Muhunthan’s tragedy encapsulates those of thousands of young
    lives who had much to offer their people, but whose persons, good intentions
    and energies were robbed, buried, and scorned by the fascist tendencies in
    their midst. Particularly so by the one which decreed that nearly all those
    from Peradeniya and other universities, for the crime of being able to think,
    were traitors. </p>
  <h4>The Poisoned Fount of Knowledge </h4>
  <p>The university authorities in Peradeniya had decidedly been
    wrong headed in their moves to police Tamil students, which flowed from the
    thinking of the UNP government. The students harassed and alienated were those
    unconnected with any violence at that time. The fact was that many students,
    especially from the North-East, had encountered the political or student wings
    of PLOTE, GUES (EPRLF), EROS and NLFT and were influenced by their
    Marxist-oriented programmes, but had never seen a gun. Indeed, it would have
    been a very indifferent Tamil student who was untouched by the
    government-organised communal violence of 1977 executed through the guardians
    of the law – the Police (see Arrogance of Power… and the Sansoni Commission
    proceedings).</p>
  <p>These were grave issues, and the atmosphere in the
    University, which itself had become a tool of a partisan ideology, was hostile
    to any open discussion. Moreover, particularly after the Russian revolution,
    generations of students have been through universities the world over openly
    organising around cries to overthrow the system through revolution. But
    governments in democratic societies largely ignored them, leaving it to the
    appropriate sections of civil society to deal with them through dialogue, and
    were better off for it.</p>
  <p>One can also see that the security forces were quite lost in
    carrying out nebulous orders under the PTA to crush terrorism, where
    distinctions between opinions, intentions and actions were thoroughly blurred.
    Perhaps the security forces interrogators came off marginally better than
    university professors in at least understanding the futility of it. This was
    yet another lesson that the security forces must not be used to buffer
    political incompetence and procrastination. This is a continuing disease in Sri
    Lanka that has debased and paralysed the security forces through misuse.</p>
  <p>When it became known that Balasooriyan was to be handed over
    to the Police, his Sinhalese practicals group-mate Bakmedeniya who felt bad
    approached him and told him that he would supply the notes for the lectures he
    would miss. The Sinhalese roommate of the student summoned for a session at
    Gurunagar, told him after the violence at Hilda, “<i>We can now understand why
    your people want Eelam</i>.” This student from Hatton was not otherwise
    politically involved. These Sinhalese students showed greater sense than those
    who should have set them an example and brought these issues and the Lanerolle
    report out into the open. Instead, the Tamil students were condemned to live
    and study among their unpunished UNP assailants.  </p>
  <p>Several Tamil students displaced from Peradeniya in 1983
    wanted a socialist and democratic Eelam and gave their life for it. The poisoning
    of the politics is today reflected in the sorry state of Jaffna and Eastern
    Universities. While Peradeniya would reflect the average political culture in
    Sri Lanka, Jaffna and Eastern have become arms of the LTTE. During the 1977
    violence, the authorities and Tamil students in Jaffna went all out to protect
    the Sinhalese students. In 1990 when Muslim civilians along with the Muslim
    students in Jaffna were evicted, the University was terrorised and dumb.  </p>
  <p>In 1991, students in the University of Jaffna protested when
    the LTTE arrested a number of students with allegedly dissident connections.
    The LTTE placed on stage a senior teacher of Tamil to address the students. He
    literally threatened the students and called the dissident students traitors,
    along with the Muslims, weeds to be plucked up and cast away! University
    traditions in the country as a whole, from 1977, closely followed its political
    erosion.</p>
  <p>In one of its strongest indictments of the of the May 1983
    incidents at Peradeniya, the Lanerolle report stated: “<i>To describe the
    May-June incidents as inter-communal would be inaccurate; rather, with traffic
    flowing entirely one-way, it would be more correct to call them an unseemly
    exhibition of racism</i>.” Little wonder then that it was suppressed. But it
    had its effect. Moreover, it showed that there were some at Peradeniya who were
    willing to stand up and be counted. To be fair, any academic in the North-East
    who tried to stand up in a like manner would have been forced to contemplate
    the brevity of life. That in itself carries a deep message about the politics
    prevalent there.</p>
