mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>I</span></b>t was just ten years ago, in March 1988, 
    that some of&nbsp; us completed the first draft of the <b>Broken Palmyrah</b>, 
    that was begun during the Indian Army&#146;s offensive in October 1987. The 
    origins&nbsp; of the University Teachers of Human Rights as a national organisation, 
    mooted at a meeting of the Federation of University Teachers&#146; Associations 
    during the middle of 1988 are explained in the first report of&nbsp; the UTHR 
    (Jaffna) issued about the end of that year.&nbsp; The need for the UTHR (J) 
    was exemplified by the fact that at least half the academic staff in the University 
    of Jaffna had filled in membership forms.&nbsp; A key document of the context 
    is the statement &#145;Laying Aside Illusions&#146; signed by fifty members 
    of the university&#146;s academic staff and issued in October 1988.&nbsp; 
    It dwells on the rising tide of internal and external terror, the hundreds 
    of lives which included the best among us, that were continuing to fall prey 
    to a home grown totalitarian ethos, and our complicity, complacency and cowardice 
    that brought about this state of affairs.&nbsp; We&nbsp; wish the surviving 
    signatories will read again that document which through a charmed history 
    found its way into the appendix of the Broken Palmyrah, by way of reflection, 
    and examine the roles they had each played during the vicissitudes of the 
    intervening decade.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Here we are then after more than ten years in 
    our work, but with little to rejoice or to celebrate.&nbsp; These have been 
    ten violent years that have further scarred the community to breaking point.&nbsp; 
    Of our immediate circle we lost Rajani Thiranagama in September 1989 and two 
    students Manoharan and Chelvi Thiagarajah, who were presumably executed after 
    a year or two of imprisonment.&nbsp; Of those who broadly shared our vision 
    and were part of an extended circle on the fringes of the university and beyond, 
    we lost several more.&nbsp; All of them were victims of internal terror.&nbsp; 
    Although we&nbsp; were never lax in holding state powers accountable for their 
    cynical calculations, and state forces for their brutality and callousness, 
    we had to walk a tight rope.&nbsp; We believed that the phenomenon of internal 
    terror had to be faced squarely because we perceived that what debilitated 
    our society were chiefly developments within, and that a healthy society in 
    the modern era has so many less painful options in dealing with external oppression.&nbsp; 
    This rendered us prone to being caricatured as simply and blindly anti-LTTE 
    by extreme Tamil nationalists and by peace activists who found us awkward, 
    but hard to ignore.<a href="#Top">[Top]</a></p>
  <h2><a name="_Toc514776162"><span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>What 
    has changed ?</span></a><span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'> 
    </span></h2>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>When the UTHR was first mooted by academics in 
    the South in 1988, the country had already seen five very violent years.&nbsp; 
    The first four had to do with the indiscriminate deployment of the state apparatus 
    against the Tamils in general, with several attacks by Tamil militants against 
    Sinhalese civilians and bombings in public places in Colombo.&nbsp; The last 
    of the five had seen the rising tide of violence and counter-violence precipitated 
    by the second JVP insurgency.&nbsp; It was the logical culmination of state 
    violence directed against a minority.&nbsp; With the destruction of civil 
    society which it entailed, its natural second direction was within - inside 
    the Sinhalese society itself.&nbsp; The UTHR in the South barely survived 
    a year.&nbsp; Perhaps it was five years too late &#151; too late to establish 
    a degree of discipline, credibility and acceptance.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>The experience left a mark on Sinhalese society 
    that prepared it for a rational reappraisal of the Tamil question.&nbsp; From 
    1993 this changed mood was seen in responses to the electoral campaigns that 
    brought the People&#146;s Alliance led by Chandrika Kumaratunge to power in 
    August 1994.&nbsp; Yet, what has changed one may ask?&nbsp; It is after all 
    within the space of the last two months that two devastating LTTE bombings 
    have been experienced in the South &#151; Kandy and Maradana, and there is 
    a bitter confrontation in the Vanni in the midst of which the civilians have 
    been far from immune.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;
mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>The answer to what has changed may be seen briefly in 
    the following excerpt from a recent article by Dayan Jayatilleke on the Premadasa 
    - LTTE talks (The Island,4</span><sup><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:6.5pt;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>th</span></sup> March 1988):&nbsp; 
    &#147;The Habarana massacre [by the LTTE of Buddhist pilgrims] of 1987 and 
    the Pettah bomb blast took place in early April of that year just at the time 
    Lalith Athulathmudali, at the insistence of J.N. Dixit, had been constrained 
    to announce a one-week unilateral cessation of hostilities....&nbsp; The LTTE 
    and its ally EROS, reacted with the Habarana and Pettah attacks....&nbsp; 
    This in turn caused such a groundswell of anti - Government opinion among 
    the Sinhalese that the Government felt it had to do something drastic.&nbsp; 
    That was the aerial bombing of Jaffna...&#148;&nbsp; [More details in the 
    Broken Palmyra.]</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>In recent times too there have been several tragic 
    uninvestigated instances of aerial bombing by the SLAF in the North which 
    the government needs to account for.&nbsp; But these aerial bombings did not 
    stem from any political need or demand to appease Sinhalese sentiment.&nbsp; 
    This is the difference, and a crucial one.&nbsp; The Jayewardene government 
    had cultivated Sinhalese chauvinist sentiment as the bread and circus for 
    its survival.&nbsp; In 1983 it let loose against Tamil civilians everywhere.&nbsp; 
    In 1987 in felt constrained to spare at least the Tamils in the South while 
    letting loose in Jaffna.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>Also, 
    thanks to constant pressure by international and local human rights agencies, 
    recent political changes in the South, and to reappraisals within the armed 
    forces themselves, massacres and reprisals have become the exception rather 
    than the norm. Both these tendencies still have a long way to go to achieve 
    stability.</span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>A word of caution is in order here.&nbsp; While 
    the LTTE bomb attacks in the South deserve to be condemned in the strongest 
    terms, in particular by the Tamils, and the government and the Sinhalese be 
    given due credit for the handling of the aftermath, another aspect reveals 
    something deeply disturbing.&nbsp; To take one example among several, Air 
    Force bombing of the precincts of the Church of St. Peter and St. Paul, Navaly 
    on 10<sup><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-size:6.5pt;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>th</span></sup> July 
    1995 claimed the lives of about 120 refugees.&nbsp; To the pilot the church 
    and the huge stream of refugees would have been prominently visible.&nbsp; 
    The President promised an inquiry.&nbsp; The Defence Ministry then issued 
    a highly imaginative briefing to the press about stored explosives near the 
    church and sympathetic explosions.&nbsp; That was the end of the matter.&nbsp; 
    No inquiry despite the area now being under Army control.&nbsp; The NGO and 
    human rights communities in the South too failed to keep the matter alive.&nbsp; 
    A later official inquiry about the Air Force on other matters found it guilty 
    of gross negligence and incompetence.&nbsp; That too was suppressed ostensibly 
    to protect persons in the political establishment.&nbsp; Strongly expressed 
    outrage over bombings in the South taken against the silence over similar 
    events in the Tamil areas, shows ultimately how divided this country continues 
    to be.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>In exposing&nbsp; violations by state forces, 
    restraint and observance of human rights are measures we had been urging from 
    the beginning.&nbsp; We argued that the stabilisation of such attitudes is 
    a necessary pre-condition for the revival of healthy political activity within 
    the Tamil community.&nbsp; On the many occasions we in the University of Jaffna 
    confronted Indian army officers with our demands, some listened patiently 
    and took note.&nbsp; But many of them maintained that as long as there had 
    to be military operations, reprisals could not be controlled.&nbsp; We could 
    also see that for several of them, the use of terror in warfare of this kind 
    was normal.&nbsp; For several months Vadamaratchy had remained quiet under 
    Indian Army control.&nbsp; One day in June 1988 they systematically beat up 
    a large number of civilians in response to the LTTE gunning down two Indian 
    Army Hindu worship leaders. The situation steadily deteriorated culminating 
    in the Valvettithurai massacre of 2<sup><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:6.5pt;
mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>nd</span></sup> August 1989.&nbsp; </p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>For the Sri Lankan Army it has been a long time.&nbsp; 
    If they had learned from the 80s the importance of&nbsp; sparing civilians, 
    the war would not have gone so disastrously for them from June 1990.&nbsp; 
    That story is told in our reports and in the book &#147;Someone Else&#146;s 
    War&#148; of February 1994 based on them.&nbsp; We hope, judging from what 
    is going on in Jaffna, that something benign and substantive is at least emerging 
    today.&nbsp; If that is true, we may cautiously hope that inspite of the violence 
    the coming months and years may bear witness to, the foundations are being 
    put into place for its cessation and replacement by a rational political process.&nbsp; 
    This also shows the importance of the close monitoring and international interest 
    that is focused on Jaffna today.&nbsp; By comparison, in rural areas and other 
    parts of the North-East, abuses continue to be widespread. <a href="#Top">[Top]</a></p>
  <h2><a name="_Toc514776163"><span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>An 
    old story</span></a></h2>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Few knew the Tigers so closely from within as 
    Rajani Thiranagama did, and was at the same time possessed of such acute discernment 
    to see clearly where they were going.&nbsp; Her verdict was thus expressed 
    in the <b>Broken Palmyra</b> with terse clarity:</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><b><i>&#147;The Tigers&#146; history, their theoretical 
    vacuum, lack of political creativity, intolerance and fanatical dedication 
    will be the ultimate cause of their own break up.&nbsp; The legendary Tigers 
    will go to their demise with their legends smeared with the blood and tears 
    of victims of their own misdoings.&nbsp; A new Tiger will not emerge from 
    their ashes.&nbsp; Only by breaking with this whole history and its dominant 
    ideology, can a new liberating outlook be born&#148;.</i></b></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>By 1984 at the latest, the moral and the political 
    choices of the LTTE had been made, the die was cast and the engine of destruction 
    had been launched.&nbsp; Its essential lines of progress had been laid down.&nbsp; 
    Only the time frame was open.&nbsp; It could have easily come a cropper in 
    1987 or 1990.&nbsp; It was not engaged in&nbsp; a contest of strengths, but 
    rather in a counter contest between its destructive ingenuity on the one hand 
    and the callous and stupid arrogance of state powers on the other.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>What is intriguing is the surfeit of nonsense 
    said and written about this phenomenon over the years.&nbsp; Academics have 
    seen in it a pioneer in caste and women&#146;s liberation.&nbsp; An undaunted 
    stream of peace makers have made contact with it fired by wilful ignorance 
    and fuelled by egotism.&nbsp; The result&nbsp; was always&nbsp; the same &#151; 
    an acute hang over!&nbsp; Often the LTTE spokesman who kept them in hope would 
    suddenly develop feet of clay and be withdrawn from grace, leaving them confronting 
    a vacuum.&nbsp; Newspapers and journalists, with a few exceptions, get it 
    all wrong. They deal only with fragments of reality - such as the bomb blast 
    of the day.&nbsp; Frequently, the exasperating question posed by them is &#145;What 
    is the latest?&#146;&nbsp; The latest is, alas, more than 15 years old! <a href="#Top">[Top]</a></p>
  <h2><a name="_Toc514776164"><span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>A 
    confusion of values and the absence of quality</span></a></h2>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>What is particularly disturbing today is that 
    many who advise and make decisions that will affect the Tamil community and 
    the future of this country do so on a fragmentary understanding based on ad 
    hoc/occasional discussions and correspondents&#146; dispatches.&nbsp; Even 
    worse is the confusion among Colombo Tamils,&nbsp; journalists and research 
    workers, who are not necessarily pushing a line or harbouring an agenda, but 
    are called upon to act as spokesmen.&nbsp; To get some clarity in the matter, 
    every oppressive tendency in the State is bound to meet with a reaction, that 
    could often take the form also of institutionalised violence by rebel groups 
    or a group.&nbsp; In time the nature, character and intensity of violence 
    too would undergo change.&nbsp; Parallely there would be tendencies among 
    all the parties towards reappraisal and peace making, and also the formation 
    of vested interests wanting escalation and permanent war.&nbsp; There are 
    chains of possibilities.&nbsp; Which one is dominant now or how one could 
    make a particular desired group of possibilities dominant is a subject of 
    serious analysis of the underlying tendencies. </p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>It is true that the LTTE has placed itself in 
    the position of being the sole agent of anti-state violence and also that 
    there have been, and always are peace efforts.&nbsp; But to conclude from 
    this that the LTTE&#146;s actions would lead to peace and the liberation of 
    Tamils is patently fallacious.&nbsp; In the volatile climate created by these 
    actions, almost every sentiment is transient.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>The vacillation and fragmentariness, so evident 
    in the media and in decision making, is the result of confusion of values 
    and the absence of quality that is part of the social disease.&nbsp; A liberation 
    struggle must be judged by its key facets:&nbsp; Whether it values life or 
    destroys it;&nbsp; Whether it brings people inner strength and dignity, both 
    as individuals and community, or devastates everything necessary to build 
    these;&nbsp; Whether it affords protection to the weak, the exploited and 
    the children, or uses their vulnerability to fuel a cynical and suicidal warfare;&nbsp; 
    And by whether it has the basic human qualities that win it friends, or needs 
    permanent enemies to sustain those it brings into power.&nbsp; Without the 
    positive attributes mentioned, devolution or a separate state would be an 
    empty&nbsp; parody of liberation. </p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Thus one cannot resolve the confusion surrounding 
    the LTTE without taking into account the crucial aspect of its relationship 
    with people.&nbsp; This has been the thread running through our work.&nbsp; 
    In documenting the Indian Army&#146;s entry into Jaffna during October-December 
    1987 and the Sri Lankan Army&#146;s entrance to towns and villages in the 
    Eastern Province during June-December 1990, what had struck us was the total 
    cringing powerlessness of the people in the face of armies acting with utmost 
    arrogance and contempt for their life.&nbsp; It was a powerlessness that was 
    moral rather than physical.&nbsp; Even as a supposedly liberating force the 
    LTTE deliberately wanted them in that position of insecurity.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>The insecurity aided its recruitment and enhanced 
    its status as avenger or liberator.&nbsp; It thus became much easier to brand 
    all dissent as treachery.&nbsp; Through enhancing mutual suspicions and enmities 
    by acts of terror against other communities, the LTTE&#146;s cause developed 
    a common vested interest with Southern chauvinism and with permanent conflict.&nbsp; 
    Both within the LTTE itself and also in the community at large came to dwell 
    a pervasive insanity that was characterised by schizophrenia and a breakdown 
    of humanity.&nbsp; A retrospective look would strongly suggest that the foundations 
    were already laid in the formative years of the struggle. <a href="#Top">[Top]</a></p>
  <h2><a name="_Toc514776165"><span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>A 
    retrospective look at some developments</span></a></h2>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Having quoted Rajani Thiranagama, it is appropriate 
    to sketch here some salient features of developments from the early 80s in 
    view of the prevailing confusion.&nbsp; This is based mostly on material already 
    covered in our publications.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>The Tamil struggle has an antiquity predating 
    independence by several decades.&nbsp; Perhaps the more important part of 
    it was work at grassroots level.&nbsp; The co-operative movement was launched 
    from the 1920s.&nbsp; The Jaffna Youth Congress from about that time took 
    up the caste issue and worked towards the removal of caste barriers in school 
    admissions.&nbsp; In the 1960s Marxist grassroots groups were involved in 
    securing temple entry and local economic independence for oppressed groups.&nbsp; 
    At a different level, state oppression resulted in Tamil politics being dominated 
    by the nationalist Tamil United Liberation Front, the mainstay of whose politics 
    was the &#145;external enemy&#146; and the victimhood of the Tamil people.&nbsp; 
    Also developed for public consumption in order to disguise its own failures 
    was the imputation that its democratic opponents were &#145;traitors&#146;.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>All the emerging militant movements represented 
    shades of these two traditions.&nbsp; The first had strong democratic leanings 
    while the latter became increasingly authoritarian and intolerant of dissent.&nbsp; 
    Both the leaders of the PLOTE and the LTTE emerged from the second, having 
    been proteges of figures in the TULF hierarchy.&nbsp; Of the cadre, some came 
    with political motivation, and many from the outstations came in as the direct 
    result of state oppression, to be moulded by their groups.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Pulendran, for example, from Palayootru near Trincomalee, 
    was affected when his village was attacked by Sinhalese colonists, who were 
    the proteges of the state, at the time in 1977 when the ashes of the TULF 
    leader S.J.V. Chelvanayakam were brought to Trincomalee.&nbsp; Pulendran described 
    as a good friend and hard worker, but with a violent temper, joined the LTTE 
    and rose to become&nbsp; a local leader credited with the Habarana massacre 
    of 1987 referred to earlier.&nbsp; </p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Many who did political work for the LTTE in the 
    early 80s, campaigned for it as a democratic&nbsp; group where decisions were 
    taken by the central committee that was chaired by their leader Prabakaran.&nbsp; 
    They were taken aback when the oath of personal loyalty to the leader was 
    introduced in 1984 and the leader did a personalised photographic media blitz 
    in the Indian journal &#145;the Sunday&#146;.&nbsp; In the meantime, a strong 
    conformist culture with&nbsp; internal spy networks was being built up, but 
    the material needs of the cadre - all this was in India at that time - were 
    well looked after.&nbsp; The leader was regarded as a good host.&nbsp; Some 
    elements of this culture were, anyone trying to spend time with books was 
    subject to collective ridicule, while another displaying artful and sadistic 
    cruelty in slaughtering a goat became the hero of the day.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Recruits with good educational backgrounds were 
    looked upon with intense suspicion.&nbsp; An anecdotal incident is related 
    about a recruiter who crossed the sea from Jaffna and proudly went to show 
    the Leader three university students he had brought.&nbsp; The Leader&nbsp; 
    whispered to him in disapproval, &#147;Why did you bring them?&#148;&nbsp; 
    Those who&nbsp; retained a capacity to think independently saw&nbsp; within 
    an organisation where each person was being false to himself and a disgusting 
    sycophancy where each sucked up to those above him.&nbsp; No one had a friend 
    who could be trusted with his innermost thoughts.&nbsp; It was not an atmosphere 
    in which one could fight a liberation struggle.&nbsp; Also well known in India 
    was the Green Boat.&nbsp; Those to be culled as being too independent of mind 
    were sent in it as though being sent for deployment back home.&nbsp; They 
    were never seen again on either shore. </p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>The foundations had thus been clearly laid for 
    an organisation whose ideal recruits were children rather than mature youth.&nbsp; 
    This it started doing on a big scale when it was imposing a parallel repressive 
    structure on Jaffna after decimating other groups in 1986.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>The support base of the LTTE that was more prominently 
    found in safety far away from the conflict and for whom its cause was self 
    serving, even found in this something to boast about.&nbsp; With the approach 
    of National Heroes Week,&nbsp; <b>Ulakatthamilar</b>, the Canada based journal 
    of the <b>World Tamil Movement</b>, carried in its issue of 15.11.93 a feature 
    &#145;Tamil Children (Pillaykal) March towards Tamil Eelam&#146;.&nbsp; After 
    citing some heroic deeds and chronicling martyrdoms it concludes, <i>&#147;Today 
    Tamil children who should carry books are seen with AK47 rifles hanging on 
    their shoulders.&nbsp; These fighters stand guard surrounding Sinhalese army 
    camps and borders of Tamil Eelam...&#148;</i></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Thus, cut off from any accountability&nbsp; to 
    its people, and its relations within and without the movement governed by 
    falsehood, fear and sycophancy, Rajani saw within the LTTE its own seeds of 
    destruction.&nbsp; These cancerous seeds also found in the very society from 
    which their genetic elements had been drawn, fertile soil in which to wreak 
    their havoc.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>From June 1990 several LTTE leaders whose profile 
    had been high around Jaffna fell from grace to obscurity or worse.&nbsp; In 
    1993 deputy leader Mahattaya was detained in a swoop along with those believed 
    to have had links with him, and all were tortured by their erstwhile comrades 
    in arms.&nbsp; News came out the following year that several divisional commanders 
    were implicated in an embezzlement racket.&nbsp; In an organisation without 
    trust, there are few binding ties once the all-pervasive ethos of fear is 
    absent. Everyone who was once associated with the movement is seen as a source 
    of danger.&nbsp; Today its violence has sharply turned within. This theme 
    is taken up elsewhere in this report.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>A particular episode concerning children touches 
    us closely.&nbsp; In July 1991 the LTTE tried to overrun the strategic&nbsp; 
    Elephant Pass army camp.&nbsp; The attack failed with the LTTE suffering heavy 
    casualties.&nbsp; In a desperate bid to overwhelm the camp before General 
    Kobbekaduwa&#146;s relief column reached it, a large number of children were 
    thrown into futile charges.&nbsp; The total dead numbered about 750.&nbsp; 
    In Jaffna Hospital there were a large number of children with limbs blown, 
    too young to comprehend what happened to them.&nbsp; Chelvi Thiagarajah and 
    Manoharan who were university students, compiled a report on their experiences.&nbsp; 
    They were detained by the LTTE which was evidently watching them, and the 
    report fell into&nbsp; its hands.&nbsp; The LTTE later told the Vice Chancellor 
    of the University of Jaffna that the two were being held because of a document 
    they had compiled for human rights organisations.&nbsp; But to the general 
    public the LTTE charged them effectively as agents of the PLOTE which was 
    assisting the government forces.&nbsp; Chelvi was a dissident from the PLOTE 
    long before it was driven into that position by the LTTE.&nbsp; We will refer 
    to this episode in the sequel.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>In the forgoing two sections we have brought into 
    focus two elements that are key to the viability of the LTTE&#146;s political 
    culture.&nbsp; One is to spread confusion about its true character.&nbsp; 
    The other is to maintain conformity among the populace through appropriate 
    repressive measures.&nbsp; The people are only allowed to play the role of 
    passive victims, blaming everything on the external aggressor.&nbsp; We will 
    touch on the first later.&nbsp; Our reports have pointed to the deadening 
    nature of this conformity that was so poignantly evident when it came to the 
    recruitment of children.&nbsp; It was as though the guardians of this society, 
    its intellectuals, church and religious leaders were acting in complicity 
    as predators.&nbsp; This is why even today there is such resistance to reappraisal.&nbsp; 
    The obverse of this is that dissent which is so necessary for the very survival 
    of this society also demanded such heavy sacrifice.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>We have dealt with these questions in our reports.&nbsp; 
    The LTTE&#146;s draconian network of prisons, particularly from 1990 to 1992, 
    have also been dealt with and we hope in due course to come out with a final 
    publication on this aspect of our history.&nbsp; The tolerance, acceptance 
    and even justification of this is so remarkable in a society that boasts a 
    high level of education with a far-flung diaspora of articulate professionals, 
    whose support for the LTTE rather than having a restraining influence, has 
    rather been mobilised to cover up its crimes and in effect to lend complicity.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>For now we will merely provide a sketch of dissent 
    in Jaffna society, the historical continuity of our place in it and its cost 
    by citing a few instances from our extended circle of associations.&nbsp; 
    All of them were young. <a href="#Top">[Top]</a></p>
  <h2><a name="_Toc514776166"><span lang=EN-GB style='text-transform:uppercase;
mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>Dissent in Jaffna &amp; its Cost:</span></a></h2>
  <h2><a name="_Toc514776167"><span lang=EN-GB style='text-transform:uppercase;
mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>A Selective Sketch</span></a></h2>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>When one speaks of dissent in Jaffna there were 
    two main elements in its vanguard.&nbsp; The first consisted of unorganised 
    hard-working individuals who valued decency&nbsp; and hated murder.&nbsp; 
    They could be found everywhere, among clergy, teachers, artisans, farmers, 
    TULF supporters and so on.&nbsp; The other too was individualised, but with 
    a tradition of organisation and activism behind it.&nbsp; A good section of 
    them could be traced back to the grassroots Left movement of the 60s&nbsp; 
    which was joined by persons who left school and went into political work.&nbsp; 
    What distinguished them from the mainstream Left who were aspirants&nbsp; 
    for political power through the parliament and sometimes (eg 1970-77) enjoyed 
    it, was that they saw their immediate tasks as being among the peasantry, 
    organising against local abuses.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Three things about the grassroots Left are important 
    here:&nbsp; Their relative intellectual independence of nationalism, their 
    ability to function without institutional power and their capacity to organise.&nbsp; 
    From about 1977 when there was again communal violence, leading to a heightening 
    of the nationalist and militant mood among Tamils, the Left came under heavy 
    pressure.&nbsp; The older activists in the grass roots Left generally settled 
    down as farmers or in other trades.&nbsp; Those younger led or influenced 
    smaller militant groups whose emphasis remained political work and organising 
    the people.&nbsp; They were fiercely critical of the main militant groups 
    which accepted Indian aid and direction for the purpose of rapid expansion, 
    and in consequence became militarised and lacked any accountability to the 
    people.&nbsp; Of the LTTE in particular their criticism was stinging.&nbsp; 
    At an early stage they had warned the LTTE that their growing alienation from 
    the people, in spite of their illusion of power, would in time spell their 
    doom.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Such a prospect first came when the Indian Army 
    took Jaffna in October 1987.&nbsp; By then the smaller Left groups had become 
    almost defunct and kept aloof.&nbsp; The LTTE had always watched them warily 
    though unable to pin any charges of &#145;treachery&#146; on them.&nbsp; It 
    was only after the LTTE controlled Jaffna in 1990, under the cover of confusion 
    following the outbreak of hostilities in June, that it found the courage to 
    crack down&nbsp; on them, and crack down it did unsparingly.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>The older grassroots activists in private life 
    hardly opposed the LTTE publicly, but from time to time, from 1986, with help 
    from other dissidents, including individual priests and nuns, they provided 
    humanitarian assistance to fugitives fleeing the LTTE&#146;s bloody hands.&nbsp; 
  </p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>In our own case, as part of the wider movement 
    in the university, our statements and actions were aimed at upholding basic 
    human values, preserving democratic space for the larger community and holding 
    all armed groups accountable.&nbsp; We were also clear that we would stand 
    up for the human rights of all - including&nbsp; detained LTTE cadre.&nbsp; 
    <b>Rajani Thiranagama,</b> along with students like <b>Chelvi, Sivaramani</b> 
    and <b>Manoharan</b>, who were involved in women&#146;s and community issues, 
    were very much activists in the grassroots mould.&nbsp; Thus indirectly at 
    least our place was identifiable as part of an activist or dissident tradition 
    already established in Jaffna for many years.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>The LTTE which knew Rajani Thiranagama understood 
    this well.&nbsp; Its paranoid definition of traitor, it knew, could not be 
    fitted on us.&nbsp; This is why when it killed Rajani in September 1989 it 
    calculated on putting the blame on the Indian Army, and never admitted or 
    tried to explain it even after its culpability became widely accepted.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Another important dissident segment were the <b>Theepori 
    </b>or <b>Sparks</b> group who left the PLOTE in early 1985, exposing its 
    internal violations, torture and murder in the book <b>&#145;A New Kind of 
    World&#146;</b>.&nbsp; The book was then widely distributed by the LTTE to 
    discredit the PLOTE.&nbsp; Apart from maintaining links with other members, 
    the group became defunct by 1987.&nbsp; Yet the LTTE intent on eliminating 
    all prospective sources of dissent cracked down on&nbsp; them in mid-1991.&nbsp; 
    The Sparks leader Norbert and several others were taken in.&nbsp; The detainees 
    met with varying fates, where to discern a pattern would be a matter of contention.&nbsp; 
    But caprice, ritual and false hopes there were, so characteristic of a terror 
    that is effective.&nbsp; It is also interesting that young LTTE cadre in the 
    prison camps understood the charges against many of the captives below as 
    doing propoganda work&nbsp; against the LTTE and in some cases also of having 
    contact with the foreign human rights groups.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;
mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>Ramani</span></b> was a former medical student and a 
    member of a small Left group.&nbsp; He was picked up&nbsp; in Nallur shortly 
    after the outbreak of war in June 1990 and never seen or heard of again.&nbsp; 
    Ramani was a native of Valvettithurai and a very close kinsman of the LTTE&#146;s 
    then deputy leader <b>Mahattaya</b>.&nbsp; He&nbsp; was strong willed and 
    uncompromisingly critical of the LTTE.&nbsp; <b>Manohoran</b> seems to have 
    met a similar fate, but was alive about a year after being detained when he 
    was sent to Tango 2 in Varani, that was notorious for the cruellest forms 
    of torture.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;
mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>Chelvi</span></b> smuggled a letter out during mid-1992 
    where she sounded in good spirits and did not seem anxious about her life.&nbsp; 
    Reports from other detainees released said that she never ceased to argue 
    with her captors about the consequences of the LTTE&#146;s direction.&nbsp; 
    There was also international pressure on her behalf.&nbsp; The LTTE appears 
    to have decided that she was too dangerous to be allowed out alive.&nbsp; 
    In the sequel, a Western activist in a well known human rights organisation 
    asked <b>Lawrence Thilagar</b>, then the Lord of the LTTE&#146;s overseas 
    domains, about the fate of the poet&nbsp; Chelvi.&nbsp; Thilagar looked at 
    her directly, and told her,&nbsp; &#147;Chelvi was no more a poet!&#148;&nbsp; 
    Thilagar too went out of circulation, ostensibly in another drama of crime 
    and punishment within the bowels of the LTTE.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;
mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>Norbert </span></b>was eventually taken to Tango 5 in 
    Koilakandy to which prisoners are sent prior to release.&nbsp; But about mid 
    - 1992 he was taken in a vehicle and never seen since.&nbsp; <b>Thillainathan</b>, 
    a teacher and dramatist, who was a graduate of the University of Jaffna detained 
    about the same time as Norbert during mid-1991, was last sighted in Tango 
    1 (Anaikkottai) around New Year 1992, having become half his original size 
    and totally bald.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>It was thus that things stood in Jaffna about 
    1993 as the LTTE&#146;s rule assumed an air of permanence.&nbsp; Its favoured 
    elite acted as spokesmen for the people, telling influential bodies everywhere 
    that the LTTE alone represented the Tamils.&nbsp; How weak and ill-founded 
    this claim was , only the bold and well-informed dared to question.&nbsp; 
    The break, as often the case in such situations, came unexpectedly, and was 
    precipitated by the LTTE&#146;s loss of nerve at the thought of losing Jaffna 
    - again a symptom of its fatal weakness. <a href="#Top">[Top]</a></p>
  <h2><a name="_Toc514776168"><span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>April 
    1996 - The Break</span></a></h2>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>The question naturally arises, did those thousands 
    scattered through numerous villages and whose names have not even been recorded, 
    who died in the cause of dissent, whether spontaneously on the spur of the 
    moment or through deliberate resolution standing up for basic human values, 
    die in vain?&nbsp; The answer, we are sure is No.&nbsp; The sacrifice of some 
    helps both dissent and the values it represents to live on in society as a 
    diffuse quality, waiting for opportunities to assert itself.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>When we chronicled the forced Exodus from Jaffna 
    in October 1995, it was not immediately clear how far-reaching its consequences 
    were.&nbsp; The attempts to cover up the truth were tremendous.&nbsp; Everything 
    the people saw from the LTTE&#146;s total unconcern for them, to its blatant 
    extortion in their helplessness infuriated them.&nbsp; Even more so did the 
    attempts to misrepresent their state of mind.&nbsp; The BBC Tamil Service 
    reported a meeting in Pt Pedro with 10 000 students participating, where their 
    teachers urged them to join the LTTE.&nbsp; Displaced listeners&nbsp; in Pt 
    Pedro recalled that something had gone on where curious passers by stopped 
    and listened for awhile, but that the crowd had hardly exceeded 100 at any 
    time!</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>The LTTE&#146;s attempt to shift the mass of the 
    people to the Vanni met with increasing resistance.&nbsp; We have also recorded 
    the spontaneous return of nearly 300 000 people to Valikamam in April 1996 
    when the Army commenced its move into Thenmaratchy.&nbsp; As to the extent 
    of the break from the LTTE, we too had erred on the side of caution.&nbsp; 
    After their bad experience with the LTTE, the people saw in at least a section 
    of the Sri Lankan Army, a humanity they never before dreamt was there.&nbsp; 
    We place on record two instances so characteristic of the mood then.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>A gentleman was passing an army check-point where 
    an officer was distributing food parcels on a Poya day.&nbsp; The gentleman 
    asked if he could have another parcel for his wife.&nbsp; While giving the 
    second parcel the officer said, &#147;I am Ananda Hamangoda&#148;, inquired 
    after the gentleman&#146;s name and said that he would like to talk to him 
    when convenient.&nbsp; Before leaving , the gentleman asked the officer what 
    his rank was.&nbsp; &#147;I am the Town Commandment&#148;, came the reply.&nbsp; 
    Brigadier Hamangoda was killed by a suicide bomber on 4<sup><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:6.5pt;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>th</span></sup> July 1996.&nbsp; 
    The gentleman remains very moved by the simplicity and unassuming nature of 
    the conversation.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Lieutenant Samarakoon was a junior officer posted 
    in Chavakacheri, who was known to be very helpful.&nbsp; At a time when medical 
    services were disorganised, he arranged for an ambulance to come from KKS 
    and transport a young girl who was seriously ill to Palay military hospital.&nbsp; 
    Samarakoon was later transferred to Thanankilappu, reportedly for exceeding 
    his authority in trying to have a detainee released.&nbsp; Samarakoon died 
    in action at his new posting.&nbsp; The sadness of the old gentleman who recounted 
    this last year, was compounded by the role of the Army in the disappearances 
    which followed and the relative inaccessibility of the officers thereafter.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>For a time at least, developments in the rest 
    of the country and in the saga of the Tamils had placed the&nbsp; people of 
    Jaffna and the Sri Lankan Army on such mutually responsive terms as were even 
    remotely without precedent.&nbsp; The disappearances that followed 4<sup><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-size:6.5pt;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>th</span></sup> July 
    1996 marked a setback, but not a reversal.&nbsp; </p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Leading sections of society who had acted as spokesmen 
    had been readily mobilised by the LTTE in its attempt to move the people to 
    the Vanni.&nbsp; For a time the University of Jaffna and two Christian Theological 
    seminaries were shifted there.&nbsp; Events amply revealed the deep gulf that 
    had come to separate these leaders from the people.&nbsp; Some of them mellowed.&nbsp; 
    In some others the revelation imbued them with a maniacal quality.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>For the people themselves there was operating 
    in the break a kind of herd instinct.&nbsp; It was not organised.&nbsp; One 
    could explain it as a simple wish to preserve life , to recover such property 
    as was left, or to return home.&nbsp; Could it have happened without the spirit 
    of dissent&nbsp; having life within the social fabric?&nbsp; Is not dissent 
    after all in a sense preservation of life expressed at a more altruistic level?

  <h2><a name="_Toc514776170"><span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>The 
    Primary Task of Tamils Themselves</span></a></h2>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Both in October 1987 and June 1990, war was thrust 
    upon the people by the LTTE when what they wanted most was peace.&nbsp; In 
    March 1995 it was clear to the people of Jaffna that the LTTE was definitely 
    going to resume the war.&nbsp; But among those in the South who maintained 
    their own channels through NGOs and churches these signals went largely unheeded.&nbsp; 
    Even after the recommencement of war in April 1995, there were a number of 
    apologists for the LTTE&#146;s action among influential Southerners and NGOs 
    - as reflected in, say, the statements of the National Peace Council.&nbsp; 
    But very remarkably, in a series of interviews recorded in Jaffna by the BBC 
    Tamil Service then, a number of persons living under LTTE control refused 
    to be drawn into blaming the Government for the war.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Then came the exodus of October 1995, the truth 
    about which was hard to suppress.&nbsp; Angry letters and articles by Jaffna 
    folk appeared in the press exposing the LTTE.&nbsp; Very clearly, all these 
    developments showed that something was radically&nbsp; wrong&nbsp; with the 
    proposition that the LTTE represented the Tamils in any meaningful sense.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Two things are clear.&nbsp; The LTTE must be politically 
    defeated for the Tamils to find space to reassert their will for life with 
    dignity. Moreover, the very institutions that should normally have aided them 
    seem to have developed an inertia over the years where they are more bound 
    to do the opposite.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>It has been said that the local conflict has notched 
    about 40 000 publications.&nbsp; This means that it should have been among 
    the few best understood in the world.&nbsp; But is it?&nbsp; Has the outlay 
    of money and effort over the years by NGOs, scholars, churches and peace groups 
    resulting in positions taken and inertia formed, become part of the problem 
    rather than its solution?&nbsp; Yet one sees very little reassessment.&nbsp; 
    It is instead the same faces at conferences, global and local, and almost 
    the same positions with perhaps minor refinements on accommodating the LTTE 
    as the sole representatives of the Tamil people.&nbsp; But to pose the radical 
    question whether it can work would of course involve too heavy a cost in accountability.&nbsp; 
    A much greater sense of responsibility should have been exercised in trying 
    to represent a people under fascist control.&nbsp; This we have dealt with 
    in earlier reports many years ago to the chagrin of many.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>The unenviable task of liberating the Tamils falls 
    thus, to the Tamils themselves.&nbsp; They have accomplished two things that 
    are a pointer to much more that could be done.&nbsp; One is the mass return 
    to Valikamam and the other is voting at the recent local elections.&nbsp; 
    Both these were departures from the role marked out for them by the LTTE and 
    the spokesmen foisted on them.&nbsp; The next step would be to open up discussion 
    of crucial issues, and build up institutions from grassroots level to aid 
    collective action and to uphold basic human values.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>This has become especially urgent because the 
    internal terror, ideologically supported by narrow nationalism, had over the 
    years destroyed all grassroots activity, open discussion and&nbsp; soul searching. 
    This made the people powerless. As we mentioned earlier it is time for new 
    initiatives to take root in re-evaluating the past and recreating&nbsp; democratic 
    space to fight for their dignity.&nbsp; There are many obstacles to this. 
    Our own&nbsp; initiatives up to now may in a small way contribute this process. 
    But, it is up to those who share and feel for the need of this kind of initiative 
    to start thinking and organising along these lines. There are many at all 
    levels in our community longing for such a break-through.&nbsp; After 10 years 
    of&nbsp; our functioning, we feel that&nbsp; we need to look for and to encourage 
    new initiatives involving&nbsp; broader participation. <a href="#Top">[Top]</a></p>

    time for change</span></a></h2>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>When we came into this work ten years ago it was 
    undertaken voluntarily as an integral part of our academic commitment at the 
    university.&nbsp; Using facilities at the university ten copies of the first 
    report were circulated in photocopied form, made from the original typescript.&nbsp; 
    60 copies of the second were produced in April 1989 on the cyclostyling machine.&nbsp; 
    There were bouquets from around the world and brick bats too.&nbsp; A copy 
    was returned through the Vice Chancellor by the Chairman of the Valvettithurai 
    Citizens&#146; Committee containing strong adverse remarks.&nbsp; The Major 
    commanding&nbsp; the Thinnevely Indian Army camp requested a copy which we 
    ignored.&nbsp; He may have got one by other means.&nbsp; It contained a report 
    of the incident where two students were killed in firing by men under&nbsp; 
    his command.&nbsp; The Vice Chancellor, Prof. Thurairajah was then&nbsp; closely 
    associated with us as Co-Chairman of the National UTHR.&nbsp; There was a 
    spirit of adventure as well as times of anxiety.&nbsp; Little did we know 
    where it would carry us.&nbsp; The murder of Rajani Thiranagama, our consequent 
    displacement to the South and the vacation of post given to the two of us 
    openly associated with the group by the University of Jaffna in May 1991, 
    have been written about elsewhere.&nbsp; We only mention here that the vacation 
    of post had nothing do with prompting by the LTTE.&nbsp; The Vice Chancellor 
    then had repeated a number of times in Colombo that the dismissals were wrong 
    and that we could not function in Jaffna.&nbsp; No one from the university 
    would defend the action when questioned individually.&nbsp; Yet the inertia 
    governing academic life and academic institutions in this country is such 
    that the matter is still being resolved after nearly 7 years.&nbsp; This is 
    a small inconvenience in a country where far worse things could still be inflicted 
    on an ordinary citizen with impunity.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>In a way our displacement to the South was providential.&nbsp; 
    We were able to cover the violations in the Eastern Province, particularly 
    during the worst years of 1990 &amp; 1991.&nbsp; In an experience that was 
    new to us, we made a number of friends, including among the Muslim community 
    and received a valuable education on the intricacies of the conflict there.&nbsp; 
    There were, of course, many brave individuals who constantly took risks and 
    also helped us in our work.&nbsp; But except for a few in the Batticaloa Peace 
    Committee around Fr. Harry Miller, we do not know of anyone else who publicly 
    documented violations at that time.&nbsp; &#145;Someone Else&#146;s War&#146; 
    gives some idea of our work in the East.&nbsp; The situation there has now 
    drastically changed with new NGOs moving in.&nbsp; But there is a paucity 
    of reporting on the LTTE&#146;s activities.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>In recent times we have again concentrated on 
    Jaffna because the situation there has now changed significantly, once more 
    giving us ready access.&nbsp; It fell to us to chronicle the exodus of October 
    1995 which turned out to be highly controversial, and to sound the alert on 
    disappearances caused by a sudden change of military policy in July 1996.&nbsp; 
    Our interest has, moreover, always been that of laying bare the deeper social 
    undercurrents leading to violations, apart from chronicling individual violations 
    themselves.&nbsp; It appears that in Jaffna now the end game of the tragedy 
    is being played out.&nbsp; This is the subject of the current report.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Looking back today, we regard the <b>Broken Palmyra</b> 
    which culminated with the developments in the 80s as our core work, in which 
    we had said most of what we had to say.&nbsp; Our subsequent reports as we 
    explained earlier, deal with the unravelling of a drama for which the choices 
    had already been irrevocably made.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>For us it is now time for a drastic slowdown, 
    a time to begin fading away.&nbsp; The river of life must fret along other 
    neglected channels too.&nbsp; There are a number of reasons for this.&nbsp; 
    Civil society in Jaffna is, we hope making a slow recovery.&nbsp; Both in 
    the North as well as the East the time has come for the professionals to take 
    over.&nbsp; There is no need for us to come in except where we have a distinct 
    contribution to make.&nbsp; Several attempts have been made to destroy our 
    credibility by or through the Council and staff bodies in the University of 
    Jaffna, using the mere parody of our vacation of post which no one was prepared 
    to defend.&nbsp; This we have survived.&nbsp; Our loss of income too had been 
    made up by friends.&nbsp; To keep up the spirit of voluntarism, we never asked 
    or accepted anything beyond what was required for bare subsistence in moderate 
    circumstances.&nbsp; For this we are grateful to many friends both here and 
    abroad, who were more than willing to help us whether as individuals or as 
    institutions.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>The time is also fast approaching where, if we 
    are staying on, we will have to stay on as professionals.&nbsp; One does have 
    serious reservations about building a career on a cause that has cost others 
    their lives.&nbsp; In the face of so much speculation and misrepresentation 
    about who and what we are, it is proper that we leave little room for confusion.&nbsp; 
    It seems only fitting as well as true to our initial commitment, that we move 
    back to something closer to the temper of our original vocation after attending 
    to some residual matters, away from transitoriness, away from the &#145;latest&#146; 
    accounts, beyond fragmentation and recover some of&nbsp; the &#145;quality&#146; 
    we are in danger of losing.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;
mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>It is appropriate to quote here the German dissident

text-transform:uppercase;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>1. Trends and Overview</span></a></h2>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>The eight months since our last report on Jaffna 
    was issued in August 1997 has been a testing time in Jaffna, for the civilian 
    population, the armed forces, the militant groups in transition, and the LTTE.&nbsp; 
    Some of the tendencies we had alluded to in earlier reports have taken a clearer 
    shape.&nbsp; As referred to in our last report on Jaffna, these must be qualified 
    by the course of other developments - particularly whether the momentum towards 
    an equitable political solution can be sustained in the South.&nbsp; If these 
    tendencies continue and are improved upon, one has good reason to be optimistic.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;
mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>To begin with, in retrospect at least a number of people 
    in Jaffna seeking an alternative to the present baneful outlook feel that 
    the holding of elections for local authorities on 29</span><sup><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-size:6.5pt;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>th</span></sup> January 
    was a good thing.&nbsp;&nbsp; Prior to the elections there was a steady barrage, 
    especially by Tamil media men, trying to discredit the exercise as irrelevant 
    and against material priorities.&nbsp; The LTTE too issued dire warnings to 
    all who attempt to exercise their vote. In the event, an estimated 40% of 
    the residents who were registered voters did cast their ballot. Most significantly 
    the people demonstrated that given certain basic conditions, they could defy 
    the elements and accomplish something collectively.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>There are other reasons apart from the elections 
    why we called the past seven months a testing time.&nbsp; From September last 
    year tension was building up as the Thileepan death anniversary (26<sup><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-size:6.5pt;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>th</span></sup><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'> September) and National 
    Heroes Week observed around the LTTE leader&#146;s birthday (on 26</span><sup><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-size:6.5pt;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>th</span></sup> November) 
    approached.&nbsp; Posters came up announcing a return of the LTTE.&nbsp; Stories 
    circulated announcing December as the month of disruption. People watching 
    for nuances in the behaviour of&nbsp; known LTTE spies who are generally comfortably 
    placed in society, also read the signs and formed their conclusions.&nbsp; 
    Their friends not in the good books of the LTTE were advised to lie low.&nbsp; 
    An act of particular intimidatory significance was the murder on 2<sup><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:6.5pt;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>nd</span></sup> 
    October in a Jaffna suburb of T. Tharmalingam, JP and news agent, who was 
    also the SLFP president for Jaffna.&nbsp; The murder revealed a good deal 
    about the LTTE&#146;s modus operandi and also its limitations.&nbsp; Other 
    developments also showed that the LTTE was taking its &#147;operation disruption&#148; 
    very seriously.&nbsp; A new unit was said to be under training in infiltration.&nbsp; 
    On the part of the LTTE it was a damning admission that they were in Jaffna 
    operating in a hostile rather than in a friendly environment.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Needless to say fear took hold of civilians.&nbsp; 
    Yet by the end of December the fear had eased and things had returned to what 
    they were before. The worst the civilians had feared was a return to what 
    happened after the 4<sup><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:6.5pt;
mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>th </span></sup>of July 1996 when a suicide bomber killed 
    the popular town commandant Brigadier Ananda Hamangoda.&nbsp; This coupled 
    with the anger arising from the demolition of the Mullaitivu army camp by 
    the LTTE including the capture of its heavy cannon, led to an operation in 
    Jaffna leading to more than 300 disappearances.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>There were many instances during the last few 
    months when things could have gone badly.&nbsp; There were a number of grenade 
    and claymore mine attacks on troops, showing a particular escalation during 
    November, claiming the lives of officers and men.&nbsp; On 6<sup><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-size:6.5pt;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>th</span></sup> December 
    a commando battalion ran into a trap in the Vanni in which more than 150 elite 
    commandos were killed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During these months a high state 
    of nervousness among troops was evident on several occasions and control was 
    barely re-established [see <a href="#_Toc514776191">Ch.4</a>].</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Much greater attention needs to be paid to the 
    conduct of the Navy that seems to be largely unaccountable.&nbsp; At least 
    three incidents of violence against fisherfolk have been reported in the three 
    weeks following the sinking of two naval craft by suicide Sea Tigers on 27.2.98.&nbsp; 
    In one of them near Pt Pedro, fisherfolk were shelled.&nbsp; The arrangements 
    in the islands too are far from satisfactory, where responsibility is shared 
    between the EPDP and the security forces.&nbsp; In all such cases, including 
    Mannar and Vavuniya, there are tell-tale signs of corruption, indisipline 
    and extortion, with a greater propensity for human rights violations.&nbsp; 
    [See <a href="#_Toc514776203">6.5</a>.]</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Following the two cases of rape and murder centred 
    around Krishanthy Kumarasamy and Rajani Velayuthapillai in September 1996, 
    both the Government and the Army showed a new will to come down hard on abuses 
    of this particular nature.&nbsp; The incidents of rape reported during 1997 
    did not exceed four.&nbsp; The Army too in general showed a prompt readiness 
    to assist the judicial authorities.&nbsp; There was however a recent case 
    of violence involving a dumb spinster where the Army&#146;s position is very 
    much open to question.&nbsp; This would be a test case for the credibility 
    of other mechanisms, such as NGOs and the Human Rights Commission, whose function 
    is to check such abuses and deliver justice [see <a href="#_Toc514776192">4.1</a>].</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Most would however readily agree with our civilian 
    observer&#146;s comment in mid-January this year:&nbsp; &#147;Things are very 
    quiet now in the run up to the local elections.&nbsp; Apart from the Tamil 
    groups plastering the walls with posters, there is very little activity noticeable.&nbsp; 
    Security has been tightened somewhat but not excessively....&nbsp; The military 
    seem confident that they can manage these elections.&nbsp; The military here 
    are doing well with commanders like General Balagalle &amp; Brigadiers Mendis, 
    Rockwood,... the behaviour of the troops is generally such that one hears 
    very little criticism.&#148; <a href="#Top">[Top]</a></p>
  <h2><a name="_Toc514776175"><span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>1.1 
    Torture</span></a></h2>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>There however continues to be a darker side to 
    the military presence.&nbsp; In some of the more isolated areas where marginalised 
    communities live, civilians have been forced to perform unpaid manual labour, 
    sometimes of a dangerous kind such as clearing shrubs along the edges of roads 
    that may be mined.&nbsp; Of greater concern are continuing reports of torture 
    [see Ch.2].&nbsp; Testimony received suggests that danger to life is very 
    real.&nbsp; It is moreover far from clear if the army got anything useful 
    from torture that it could not have got by some other intelligent means.</p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText>In one particular testimony received by us recently, the 
    father of an LTTE cadre was taken in and tortured, which included being assaulted 
    on the head, apparently after the army had received intelligence&nbsp; that 
    the son was in the area and had visited his home.&nbsp; The father who began 
    with a denial finally admitted that his son had indeed come home, adding &#147;For 
    goodness sake don&#146;t&nbsp; do anything more to me, I know absolutely nothing 
    else!&#148;.&nbsp; After troubling themselves and the father, the army did 
    not get anything that they did not already know.&nbsp; Those close to the 
    father said that he may not live long after that session.&nbsp; From what 
    is given below torture of this kind is merely routine, and may happen to anyone 
    from the humbler classes picked up on the remotest suspicion. <a href="#Top">[Top]</a></p>
  <h2><a name="_Toc514776176">1.2 Missing Persons</a></h2>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Organisations in Jaffna have continued to compile 
    lists of missing persons during the year 1997.&nbsp; A total in the region 
    of 40 has been quoted for the year.&nbsp; But this is contested by others 
    in Jaffna who place those actually missing at less than a dozen for the year.&nbsp; 
    This is in part because those who compile the lists are seldom equipped or 
    motivated to follow up in depth.&nbsp; One thus has problems in interpreting 
    the high figures floated for missing persons.&nbsp; Another probable reason 
    for the continuing&nbsp; occurrence of missing persons is torture.&nbsp; The 
    victim may have died, or the detention was prolonged to minimise external 
    signs of torture and the victim suddenly pops up in some detention camp in 
    the South.&nbsp; We have cases where this has happened.&nbsp; The laws too 
    were framed to facilitate such handling.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;
mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>Recently (19</span><sup><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:6.5pt;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>th</span></sup> January) the army 
    command in Palaly announced that a lieutenant and 9 soldiers had been taken 
    into custody by military police investigators in connection with a man, Selvaratnam 
    Jeyaseelan (24), and a woman Saraswathy Soundararajan (21), both of Suntharapuram, 
    Mattuvil South who had been taken to Vatharawattai camp for questioning on 
    28th November 1997, and then disappeared.&nbsp; The matter is now before a 
    judicial inquiry.&nbsp; Significantly the army command has observed that the 
    instructions to be followed upon the arrest of suspects have not been adhered 
    to in this case!</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>After close upon two years of dithering, first 
    by the HRTF, its successor&nbsp; the Human Rights Commission opened its Jaffna 
    office.&nbsp; The army command too issued a rather belated announcement that 
    it should be contacted if a receipt is not issued in the case of a person 
    arrested and not released within 24 hours.&nbsp; How effective these measures 
    are remains&nbsp; to be seen, as in nearly all the cases of the hundreds disappeared, 
    the local army command had been contacted immediately by relatives.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>In the meantime the Human Rights Commission&nbsp; 
    would do well to use its powers in surveying the torture centres at all the 
    main army camps where the general features and routines appear to be similar 
    (see ch.2), and find out what the instructions to be followed are.&nbsp; 2.1 
    below gives a fair idea. <a href="#Top">[Top]</a></p>
  <h2><a name="_Toc514776177">1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp; Security incidents - a rough overview</a></h2>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>As in previous reports, where information is lacking 
    or incomplete, we have made our judgements depending on the context.&nbsp; 
    Press reports too have missed out several incidents.&nbsp; Civilians killed 
    or injured by the army are readily reported as these nearly always happen 
    during crossfire or during curfew hours.&nbsp; There is in most cases no reported 
    attempt to suppress information.&nbsp; Killings by the LTTE, usually coded 
    &#147;by unknown persons&#148;,&nbsp; do not sometimes get reported.&nbsp; 
    There are instances where the army too has suppressed information on LTTE 
    cadre killed, perhaps to conceal other&nbsp; awkward circumstances.&nbsp; 
    Information on army casualties too is generally lacking.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;

    4 in February and 10 in March. All casualties this year upto March end in 
    Thenmaratchy &amp; Valikamam.</span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>We may give a tentative reading of the last two 
    trends taken together.&nbsp; There was a notable fall off in the killings 
    of civilians by the LTTE after at least 6 killings in January 1997&nbsp; alone.&nbsp; 
    By August 1997 things were fairly quiet.&nbsp; This was followed by another 
    LTTE build up apparently by specially trained cadre.&nbsp; There was some 
    change from the established pattern where infiltrators were from the same 
    area.&nbsp; During about October saboteurs getting away&nbsp; after a hit 
    in Vadamaratchy were observed asking for directions.&nbsp; Similar reports 
    came from Valikamam.&nbsp; The&nbsp; army that had become confident was getting 
    somewhat nervous. &nbsp;The break came in Vadamaratchy during mid - December 
    [see <a href="#_Toc514776190">3.2</a> ] when the army in a series of raids 
    killed several key operatives including Deputy Sea - Tiger leader Lt. Col. 
    Archunar.&nbsp; There was also among the civilians a cracking of the shell 
    built up by instilling fear.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Of the 18 cadre lost to the army in January, 8 
    were killed in Thenmaratchy and 10 in Valikamam.&nbsp; There are also certain 
    factors impeding the LTTE from taking on civilian targets with the same ease.&nbsp; 
    Earlier there was the fear that once the LTTE marked a man, there was no possibility 
    of escape.&nbsp; It only took two LTTE cadre to go to the intended victim&#146;s 
    house and demand that he follow them for a little chat.&nbsp; It only occurred 
    to the intended victim to do as he was told with the last hope of talking 
    them out of their intention.&nbsp; Having got to&nbsp; a place from which 
    escape was easy, the assassins did the deed and vanished.&nbsp; This has now 
    changed and resistance has become increasingly common.&nbsp; There have been 
    cases of the targeted victim making good his escape with the aid of those 
    around, sometimes to a nearby army camp.&nbsp; To meet such new contingencies 
    the LTTE has from September been known to send 4, 8 or 10 persons in a hit 
    squad.&nbsp; This causes extra problems, considering that in areas like Jaffna 
    town, although plenty of spies abound, it is not easy for armed cadre to move 
    about.&nbsp; [See ch.5, the murder of Tharmalingam.] <a href="#Top">[Top]</a></p>
  <h2><a name="_Toc514776178">1.4 &nbsp;The land mine menace</a></h2>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>This was highlighted by us in our Jaffna Survey 
    of last&nbsp; August [<a href="..\bulletins\bul14.htm">Bulletin No. 14</a>].&nbsp; 
    Although the German organisation GTZ made an assessment of the problem and 
    appeared to have government clearance to commence operations from the beginning 
    of January, there have been no further developments on the ground at the time 
    of writing.&nbsp; A group of NGOs in Jaffna has sent a memorandum to a UN 
    agency claiming that there are about 10 000 mines buried and that there are 
    on average 10 mine incidents every month affecting civilians.&nbsp; This would 
    suggest that many of the land mine incidents go unreported.&nbsp; It appears 
    on further examination that the incidents reported in the Uthayan correspond 
    closely with the cases&nbsp; brought to Jaffna Hospital.&nbsp; Since nearly 
    all land mine incidents take place in Valikamam within 8 miles of Jaffna Hospital, 
    which alone has surgical facilities in Valikamam, we may conclude that&nbsp; 
    injuries from other explosions are not major.&nbsp; Going by reports in the

  <p style='text-align:justify'>If the anti - personnel mine incidents reported

    is the steep, rise in October, and the sharp fall-off from December until 
    March.&nbsp; Nearly all the incidents during October took place in central 
    Valikamam, and several of these occurred in paths that had been in constant 
    use for 1 1/2 years.&nbsp; One fatal explosion in Kopay - where a man picked 
    up a coconut and a mine beneath it exploded - had the makings of a booby trap.&nbsp; 
    The question has been raised if some of these had been recently planted to 
    induce fear.&nbsp; We may tentatively answer the question in the negative, 
    considering the fact that anti-personnel mines have not been reported as being 
    among the large quantities of equipment recovered from the LTTE by the Army

    &nbsp;&nbsp; The LTTE - A Time of Reckoning</a></h2>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>The pattern of recent LTTE infiltration was to 
    seek out the homes of vulnerable folk - often poor and without men - and enjoin 
    themselves as underground guests.&nbsp; In the two cases presented in some 
    detail [<a href="#_Toc514776190">3.2</a> below], the first is one where a 
    mother and daughter, apparently with no previous LTTE ties, lived by themselves.&nbsp; 
    The other is where three sisters lived with some children, the third of whom 
    had earlier received material help from the LTTE.&nbsp; In most such hiding 
    places the LTTE had burrowed concealed underground chambers.&nbsp; It was 
    effective for moving around by night without even the neighbours knowing.&nbsp; 
    Burrowing is known to have been used during the IPKF period (1988-9), but 
    not on the present scale.&nbsp; Yet the style was that of European urban terrorists 
    of the 80s such as the Red Brigades, operating in a hostile environment among 
    an unsympathetic populace.&nbsp; Even among those sheltering them, the action 
    to say the least, lacked anything like the spontaneous support accorded to 
    a liberation movement.&nbsp; The LTTE was fast ceasing to be the ubiquitous 
    internal force it once was - when its terror was in the air everyone breathed.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>The LTTE&#146;s forced exodus of civilians from 
    the Valikamam, the losses and humiliation they (the civilians) had suffered 
    exposed the LTTE most eloquently as having no concern for the people.&nbsp; 
    Subsequent events deepened the gap.&nbsp; Having controlled the people for 
    so long, the LTTE could barely help the viewing the people who defied it and 
    remained in Jaffna after April 1996 as traitors.&nbsp; It had of course wanted 
    them to shift en masse to the Vanni.&nbsp; Looking through the security incidents 
    from April 1996, the LTTE&#146;s attacks with mines and grenades in overall 
    effect made little distinction between the civilians and soldiers.&nbsp; The 
    events include grenades thrown into a shopping mall ( <a href="../bulletins/bul13.htm">Bulletin 
    No. 13</a>), and claymore mine attacks or explosions where the victims were 
    all or nearly all civilians.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>What the civilians longed for was a return to 
    sane and ordered normal existence.&nbsp; The improved behaviour of the army 
    convinced them,&nbsp; propaganda notwithstanding, that behind the confusion 
    something new had opened up - an opportunity that could be lost through inaction.&nbsp; 
    The civilians too went through a psychological shift paralleling the suicidal 
    one of the LTTE.&nbsp; They concluded that the LTTE infiltrators were in Jaffna, 
    not for any good, but only to disrupt life for them.&nbsp; This went a long 
    way towards breaking a long established taboo.&nbsp; From the mid 70s the 
    militants were known as &#147;our boys&#148;.&nbsp; As much as one disagreed 
    with their actions, it was considered wrong to inform on them.&nbsp; The right 
    thing it was felt was to take up the matter with them as an internal matter.&nbsp; 
    This attitude was further strengthened after the state&#146;s role in the 
    violence of July 1983.&nbsp; The LTTE in particular however sowed the seeds 
    of its own destruction by using its coercive apparatus to destroy all democratic 
    space for an internal resolution of differences.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Given today&#146;s vastly changed reality, a large 
    number of people lost their inhibition against informing on the LTTE.&nbsp; 
    A greater number perhaps, would though not do it themselves, did not disapprove 
    of others doing it.&nbsp; Also of significance is the class of persons who 
    on a principled approach saw an ethical dilemma that could not be&nbsp; dodged.&nbsp; 
    This was of course a perception peculiar to Jaffna, and did not accord with 
    perceptions of troop behaviour elsewhere in the North - East.&nbsp; Many saw 
    violations by troops in Jaffna as transient or individual rather than endemic.&nbsp; 
    [Why more than 300 disappearances during the latter half of 1996 did not make 
    their due impact on the psyche of Jaffna folk cannot be examined cursorily 
    and will be dealt with in a separate publication.]</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Perhaps the key precipitating factor was that 
    the LTTE cadre in general lacked political motivation.&nbsp; They were drilled 
    into a regime of loyalty to the leader.&nbsp; Moreover many cadre who were 
    associated with the deposed deputy leader Mahattaya felt threatened.&nbsp; 
    With appropriate reconditioning &nbsp;a large number of LTTE cadre who deserted, 
    left the LTTE or were captured by the army became the mainstay of military 
    intelligence.&nbsp; According to journalistic sources, more than a hundred 
    of them work for the army in Jaffna, of whom about a third take part in operations.&nbsp; 
    Among them are at least one former leading LTTE intelligence operative, Oppilamani, 
    and a former leading Sea Tiger, Mohan.&nbsp; Also of relevance here is the 
    large number of LTTE killings of civilians and former members of the group 
    over the last two years around Valvettithurai - the home of&nbsp; both Prabakaran 
    and Mahattaya&nbsp; [see Ch.3].&nbsp; </p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;
mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>The result was unprecedented for the LTTE. Its infiltrators 
    could hardly pull off anything more than claymore and grenade attacks, and 
    assassination of individuals, from 5</span><sup><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:6.5pt;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>th</span></sup> July 1996 up to 
    now.&nbsp; A large number of LTTE infiltrators were getting ambushed having 
    done hardly anything at all.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>The LTTE&#146;s response was to hit out blindly, 
    being unable to identify sources of information.&nbsp; The victims of its 
    assassination squads included all kinds of people based on the most tendentious 
    speculation:&nbsp; Those fluent in Sinhalese having regular dealings with 
    the army, and those earlier suspected of being opposed to the LTTE.&nbsp; 
    A group that came under particular suspicion were those who had once belonged 
    to the LTTE and had left.&nbsp; [See chapters 3 &amp; 5.]&nbsp; As pointed 
    out earlier, the LTTE&#146;s attacks in Jaffna had such a desperate character 
    that in targeting one or two soldiers, the number of civilians killed did 
    not seem to matter.&nbsp; When placing a claymore or pressure mine in the 
    road it did not seem to matter if what was hit was a civilian tractor or bullock 
    cart instead.&nbsp; [See Ch.5,&nbsp; and earlier reports.]</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>The LTTE&#146;s supporters placed in strategic 
    places never ceased prophesying the LTTE&#146;s cataclysmic return to vindicate 
    their historic role and to wipe off the traitors, and particularly so from 
    September in the run up to the elections.&nbsp; What transpired instead was 
    a major setback for the LTTE.&nbsp; The LTTE calculated on the use of assassinations 
    to intimidate the civilian population and on bringing general destabilisation 
    through attacking the armed forces and provoking reprisals.&nbsp; Its failure 
    in both amounted to defeat, at least for the time being.&nbsp; The creditable 
    voter turn out marked the failure in the first.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>The LTTE&#146;s lack of success also no doubt 
    emboldened another significant group - families of persons who had suffered 
    grievously during the long years of LTTE terror.&nbsp; These folk remain unorganised 
    and there are no indications of their providing any significant assistance 
    to the Army.&nbsp; Compared with the 300 to 400 who disappeared after the 
    Army take-over, there were thousands who disappeared under LTTE rule.&nbsp; 
    But there is still no organisation to represent them.&nbsp; The LTTE itself 
    does not at present seem to regard them a threat - as compared with the suspicion 
    directed against its own former supporters.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>This seems to be a&nbsp; key calculation in the 
    LTTE not going further than it did in disrupting the local elections.&nbsp; 
    It did not attack candidates of whom there were more than 1000, or cadre from 
    other groups engaged in election work.&nbsp; This would have meant opening 
    up a new front in the face of enormous difficulties faced by its infiltrators 
    - particularly in Valikamam where the wounds from the forced exodus run deep.<a href="#Top">[Top]</a></p>
  <h2><a name="_Toc514776180">1.6 The LTTE, the Tamil political&nbsp; parties 
    &amp; current realities</a></h2>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>A peculiarity of organisations like the LTTE is 
    that its support base is nebulous and hard to define in any meaningful manner.&nbsp; 
    There are of course loose admirers with a different agenda who court them 
    and get caught as it were.&nbsp; Again there the unpoliticised many who are 
    admirers through the regular diet of jingoism dished out by the Tamil media.&nbsp; 
    But when it comes to the nuts and bolts issues of life, an organisation with 
    its politics of death can least count on them.&nbsp; For example on the Army 
    opening the road through Vanni to Colombo, the people are not in two minds.&nbsp; 
    Even among the many full time or part time agents the LTTE uses - such as 
    for example to go to the Jaffna bus terminus and keep watch on daily arrivals 
    from Colombo - the relationship has a strong element of dread, of having been 
    caught.&nbsp; It is a loveless union.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>It is therefore hardly surprising that in all 
    negotiations, any concession to democracy has been anathema to the LTTE.&nbsp; 
    Any deviation from total control over the populace was un-negotiable, in whatever 
    form this demand was barely disguised.&nbsp; Thus have two years of government 
    control over Jaffna blown many myths for those willing to see plainly.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;
mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>The calling of local elections on 29</span><sup><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-size:6.5pt;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>th</span></sup> January, 
    evidently created another problem.&nbsp; An all out attack on candidates and 
    parties would have forced many to take sides in a manner they have so far 
    avoided.&nbsp; It risked precipitating for the LTTE an unfavourable situation 
    adding to that already resulting from the exodus.&nbsp; Several candidates 
    at the elections, including a few who had received threatening letters, applied 
    to Veeman, the LTTE leader operating from Vadamaratchy East, to find out the 
    state of affairs.&nbsp; His reply was that they had not received orders, but 
    advised those who had received warning letters to stand down.&nbsp; It is 
    the kind of temporary accommodation the LTTE is used to.&nbsp; For example 
    after the LTTE struck at the TELO in May 1986, it did not directly touch the 
    EPRLF for another 7 months.&nbsp; In the meantime it had used its agents to 
    contact individuals within the EPRLF, give them some assurance and stroke 
    existing divisions within the group.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>But in Jaffna today this also meant putting up 
    with some unpleasant developments.&nbsp; Some of the other parties have opened 
    up offices in rural areas, where people come for favours.&nbsp; Moreover they 
    have established contacts with remnants of their former supporters.&nbsp; 
    The parties are also replacing a number of elected councillors with others 
    who were preferred, but had been unwilling to contest.&nbsp; Before the elections 
    the Tamil press in Colombo taunted the TULF with its inability to find willing 
    candidates resident in Jaffna.&nbsp; The conventional wisdom now is that when 
    the next elections are called, the TULF will have a flood of candidates wanting 
    nominations.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Yet most importantly, which is really what matters 
    to the LTTE, it faces no serious political challenge.&nbsp; Tamil mediamen 
    whether in Colombo or in Jaffna are unwilling to question the LTTE and are 
    for the most part happy to play to its tune.&nbsp; The parties which contested 
    the elections have either been playing at cronies of the LTTE or are so confused 
    and bankrupt that the LTTE would have little difficulty&nbsp; in using them 
    to its advantage.&nbsp; Moreover the LTTE&#146;s&nbsp; terror is already an 
    integral part of the internal workings of the Tamil community.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>To give a brief picture of how things stand, all 
    the parties have suffered a heavy toll on their leadership through murders 
    by the LTTE.&nbsp; Mrs. Sarojini Yogeswaran, the widow of the former MP for 
    Jaffna who was murdered by the LTTE, coming forward as the TULF candidate 
    for the mayoralty of Jaffna was an encouraging development.&nbsp; Here was 
    a victim of the LTTE defying ridicule from the chorus of Tamil mediamen in 
    Colombo, coming to Jaffna a lonely unarmed woman, well known, but with hardly 
    anyone to help her.&nbsp; Instead of praising her courage and condemning this 
    indignity which the Tamil people as a whole have been brought down to, a correspondent 
    observed with much satisfaction no doubt, that she seemed to have few neighbours 
    visiting her - as though she had bought a plague.&nbsp; Against this backdrop, 
    her victory was a remarkable achievement of grit. </p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Yet Mrs.Yogeswaran felt impelled to suppress her 
    most intimate feelings of endearment and outrage, and issue on behalf of the 
    party an utterly dishonest statement to the press.&nbsp; The statement was 
    to the effect that by voting for her victory the people had called upon the 
    government to lift its recent ban on the LTTE.&nbsp; The ban was reluctantly 
    imposed after the LTTE&#146;s suicide attack on the Temple of the Tooth in 
    Kandy that is sacred to the Buddhists.&nbsp; This also gives us a picture 
    of the extent of the compulsion in Tamil politics to be constantly looking 
    over the shoulder at the LTTE.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Elsewhere in the Island the PLOTE and TELO are 
    with the security forces torturing supposedly LTTE suspects.&nbsp; But in 
    Jaffna their line is Tamil nationalist and accommodative to the LTTE.&nbsp; 
    In Mannar and Vavuniya both these groups have been widely&nbsp; accused of&nbsp; 
    corruption also involving sections of the security forces.&nbsp; These rackets 
    are to do with smuggling of goods to LTTE controlled areas, and the issue 
    of residence permits, that have helped to bring about a state of unprecedented 
    anarchy in Vavuniya, with regular killings.&nbsp; In both these places these 
    groups operate monopolies on certain items, such as with eggs and coconuts 
    in Mannar Island, charging 50% more than the market value.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>There is a general stifling dilemma confronting 
    all the Tamil political parties which they have lacked the courage to resolve.&nbsp; 
    All of them carry along in their names, rhetoric and slogans, the political 
    baggage of an essentially discredited Tamil nationalism.&nbsp; In a bid to 
    get support, they dwell extensively on the real insecurity faced by the Tamil 
    people.&nbsp; All this they share in common with the LTTE.&nbsp; But without 
    confronting this narrow nationalist political legacy&nbsp; which the LTTE 
    exploits and vindicates&nbsp; by constantly and deliberately endangering the 
    Tamil population, and offering instead an alternative to&nbsp; its destructiveness, 
    the other Tamil parties find themselves impotent in addressing the security 
    issue.&nbsp; Moreover again, the LTTE scores by its role as avenger, irrespective 
    of the social cost.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>The TULF of course gains an edge over its rivals 
    who are quasi militant groups by claiming to be the unarmed party in a society 
    tired of guns.&nbsp; The others who directly or indirectly provide auxiliaries 
    to the government forces and are dependent on the government, find their position 
    more awkward.&nbsp; Their differences with the LTTE on ideology and methodology 
    are generally minor.&nbsp; Only the former has been more successful to the 
    extent that it was single-mindedly totalitarian.&nbsp; To cover their dependence 
    on the government, the others are driven to more strident nationalistic rhetoric 
    and some admiring noises of the LTTE.&nbsp; Among the quasi-militant parties 
    the EPDP has been the most astute at playing this game.&nbsp; The EPRLF which 
    has a section keen on genuine grass-roots political work is locked on the 
    horns of the dilemma.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Given this reality the LTTE would find the ground 
    situation not unfavourable in the long run.&nbsp; It could exploit it by simply 
    watching individuals who may be getting too independent, sending warning letters, 
    summoning them for meetings, and doing a bit of culling here and there through 
    assassinations.&nbsp; On occasions a more forceful warning may be delivered 
    such as by the attack on the EPDP&#146;s&nbsp; Pungudutivu camp a few days 
    before the local elections.&nbsp; All the time it would hope for a massacre 
    by the Sri Lankan forces or another round of disappearances that would turn 
    the tables in its favour.<a href="#Top">[Top]</a></p>

    &nbsp;&nbsp; The Challenge</a></h2>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>The LTTE&#146;s internal decay is far advanced.&nbsp; 
    Yet it retains a capacity for immense violent destructiveness before the final 
    end comes.&nbsp; If the worst is to be avoided there are too many uncertainties 
    in relying excessively on developments in the South.&nbsp; A huge vacuum exists 
    in the North therefore for a genuinely democratic alternative that would confront 
    the fascist legacy squarely, and render society proof against manipulation 
    by the unscrupulous. In this connection the following paragraph from &#145;Laying 
    Aside Illusions&#146; referred to in the Foreword remains as relevant today 
    as it did then ten years ago:</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    &#147;How do we assert ourselves as people when no one dare take a stand on 
    the many pressing issues?&nbsp; As individuals or small groups in our neighbourhoods, 
    places of work, unions or associations, we must question our past, understand 
    where we went wrong, and rediscover our principles.&nbsp; We must be conscious 
    of the message of our past experience, that in standing for others we also 
    stand up for ourselves.&nbsp; This course requires courage;&nbsp; and, no 
    other is open to us.&nbsp; We have tried to play it safe in the past.&nbsp; 
    The result was mass murder from several sources.&nbsp; Non combatant civilians 
    too became unarmed front-line troops facing the wrath of advancing armies</i>.&#148;&nbsp; 
    [p450, The Broken Palmyra].</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>The issues very much in our minds were the dangerous 
    opportunism that comprises &#145;playing safe&#146; and not taking responsibility 
    for our own future.&nbsp; The last ten years are a tragic testimony to the 
    extent to which we have failed.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>We knew well that the LTTE&#146;s actions were 
    calculated to make us, the people, powerless.&nbsp; But when the Indian Army 
    reacted harshly against us, we accused them of hammering us for something 
    done by outside elements - knowing well again that they were part of us terrorising 
    us from within.&nbsp; We lacked the courage to tell the LTTE plainly that 
    their &#145;freedom struggle&#146; was only making us objects of contempt 
    and they had lost any right to speak on our behalf, let alone be our leaders.&nbsp; 
    All the time an influential section among us in relative safety, who had the 
    ears of the world, talked and acted as though the LTTE were our sole representatives.&nbsp; 
    The rest of us observed silence.&nbsp; All our excuses showed that we were 
    being too clever by half.&nbsp; In all the decisions made affecting us, the 
    people, over the last ten years, we counted for nothing.&nbsp; How different 
    are things today?&nbsp; Are we going to allow history to repeat itself?</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>We make this observation here because all that 
    has been seen and recorded of the LTTE&#146;s actions (see3.1,5 and 6.1 for 
    a small sample) make it even more clear that they have no claim to represent 
    us in any way.&nbsp; What is the rationale behind the present grenade and 
    claymore mine attacks which show in effect little distinction between soldiers 
    and civilians?&nbsp; If we lack even the strength to condemn these, all our 
    concern about torture and disappearance would amount to meaningless ritual.&nbsp; 
    Because that is how things would work when we shirk responsibility.&nbsp; 
    The world will wink while paying lip service to human rights.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>We have some space today.&nbsp; Disappearance 
    and torture are at a low ebb.&nbsp; The LTTE is relatively weak in Jaffna.&nbsp; 
    Paradoxically, in the process of reviving civil society and trying to assert 
    democratic freedoms, the LTTE would also find more room to infiltrate and 
    to sabotage these very attempts.&nbsp; As we read the LTTE&#146;s future options 
    in Jaffna, the threat is very real [see 6.7].&nbsp; We have to recognise it 
    for what it is and take responsibility for our future while the opportunity 
    exists.&nbsp; Trying to be too clever with fascist tendencies inherent in 
    narrow nationalism has been the bane of Tamil political life from the early 
    70s.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>The small, but welcome openings we have at present 
    are mainly the result of the government going some way towards finding a political 
    solution and in keeping the armed forces on an even keel, despite serious 
    institutional problems.&nbsp; Has the country the will and the capacity to 
    improve on this?<a href="#Top">[Top]</a></p>
  <h2><a name="_Toc514776182">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Torture and Missing 
    Persons</a></h2>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Torture as we had adverted continues to be a routine 
    feature of life in Jaffna.&nbsp; The cases below cover much of the past year 
    and involve all the three divisions of Jaffna.&nbsp; In many of these cases 
    below some details have been suppressed.&nbsp; The first provides a recent 
    informative experience.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>The case of the missing person 2.2 below which 
    we followed to some extent reveals the absurdly incredible regime that governs 
    the fate of such persons and their families in the poorer classes.&nbsp; A 
    person coming out of Kalutara prison contacted his brother and told him of 
    his presence there.&nbsp; The brother contacted the ICRC and drew a blank.&nbsp; 
    During February the HRC (Human Rights Commission) went among the Tamil prisoners, 
    asked those from Jaffna to fill up forms, bundled the&nbsp; forms and sent 
    them to the regional office in Jaffna.&nbsp; No record of the information 
    was kept in Colombo, although several of those looking for missing relatives 
    had come to Colombo.&nbsp; On our checking with Jaffna the result was negative.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>The HRC&#146;s action confirms many things apart 
    from its own administrative clumsiness.&nbsp; Although most of these arrests 
    were witnessed, there are no reliable records anywhere; neither with the security 
    forces in Jaffna, at Kalutara prison, nor in the AG&#146;s department tasked 
    with filing indictments.&nbsp; Indeed a large number of them cannot be charged 
    with anything.&nbsp; If they survive the arrest and torture, they may simply 
    rot in prison.&nbsp; That is why the regime (not a system by any means) is 
    so corrupt.&nbsp; Those from the better off segments often bribe their way 
    out.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Those countries wanting to deport Tamils must 
    take note that any Tamil picked up on suspicion and dropped into this regime 
    could easily become as an anonymous chunk of coal dropped into a chute.&nbsp; 
    A regime that allows detainees to lose their identity would surely cause some 
    of them to disappear as was intended.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>If the HRC helps to restore a system, it will 
    make a definite contribution.&nbsp; Otherwise it is danger of becoming just 
    another mechanical addition further confusing administrative functions.<a href="#Top">[Top]</a></p>

    A recent experience</span></a></h2>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Soldiers went into a village and detained certain 
    persons suspected of harbouring the LTTE.&nbsp; One of them was a sickly man 
    just discharged after a spell in hospital.&nbsp; As they were marched about 
    a mile in the sun, some young bystanders were also picked up.&nbsp; Then they 
    were loaded into a truck and driven to an army camp.&nbsp; The prisoners numbering 
    about ten were concealed on the floor.&nbsp; The discharged patient endured 
    excruciating pain, being bounced on the metal floor as the truck sped and 
    skewed along rutty roads.&nbsp; At the camp the prisoners were taken to the 
    interrogation area where a door opened into an underground bunker.&nbsp; The 
    prisoners were ordered in and roughly shoved from the back.&nbsp; The prisoners 
    including the patient, went skittling down the flight of steps and landed 
    in a heap.&nbsp; On the first day they were given tea and food, but were not 
    questioned.&nbsp; The relatives of the prisoners went to several camps in 
    the area, and all denied having the prisoners.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>The following day the prisoners were taken out 
    of the bunker and questioned one by one.&nbsp; About half of them were severely 
    tortured, two merely questioned and the rest tortured less severely.&nbsp; 
    For those severely tortured, the procedure was one of question and torture 
    in turn.&nbsp; The torture consisted of:</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>A staccato of beating both sides of the&nbsp; 
    head in turn with bare hands.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;
mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>Assault on the body by several men wielding long sticks.</span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Being hung by the feet and lowered into a barrel 
    of water near the entrance to the bunker&nbsp; taken out in a state of near 
    suffocation, slumped flat on the ground and then questioned.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>About 3 were released within two days.&nbsp; Fortunately 
    for the patient he had escaped the worst of it.&nbsp; Those to be released 
    were called out one by&nbsp; one.&nbsp; They were threatened by a man with 
    a thick chain hung over his shoulder as though he would swing at them any 
    time, and then seemed to relent.&nbsp; The local Headman (GS) was then summoned.&nbsp; 
    In his presence they were asked if they had any problems with their treatment.&nbsp; 
    All the prisoners concurred that they had been well-treated.&nbsp; The Headman 
    then escorted away those released. All were released over a week or so.&nbsp; 
    But there is a high probability of permanent impairment among those badly 
    tortured.<a href="#Top">[Top]</a></p>

    O.levels was physically weak and suffered from a childhood impairment of being 
    blind in one eye as a result of small-pox.&nbsp; For this reason he remained 
    close to his mother whose pet he was.&nbsp; On the particular day the army 
    came into the area and took away 20 youths to Mavady junction camp on the 
    Vaddukkottai-Chankanai Road.&nbsp; All except about 5 were released during 
    the next few days.&nbsp; Among those not released to this day are Deivendran 
    and his cousin Rathinakumar who was married with a 1 1/2year old child.</p>

    August 1997 Deivendran&#146;s mother and sister went to Palaly&nbsp; for a 
    meeting with the Army to which they had been summoned.&nbsp; There the arrest 
    was denied even though the mother had witnessed it.&nbsp; The family continued 
    questioning soldiers who went for a drink of&nbsp; toddy in their area.&nbsp; 
    They were given to understand that Deivendran was being kept in a camp.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Early this year, a brother of&nbsp; Deivedran&#146;s 
    was informed by a former detainee at Kalutara that Deivendran was prisoner 
    1689 in C Ward, Kalutara - the same prison where there was an organised attack 
    on Tamil detainees on 13<sup><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:6.5pt;mso-ansi-language:

    contacted, but there has been no further information to date.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><b>Note :&nbsp; </b>Although the army took control 
    of Jaffna town in December 1995, much of Valikamam West (roughly the area 
    taken during the abortive Operation Leap&nbsp; Forward in July 1995) remained 
    uncleared until after mid - 1997.&nbsp; During this period the LTTE enjoyed 
    unfettered movement in the area, and the civilians who had either dodged the 
    LTTE&#146;s exodus (of whom 3000 or more were from this area) or had returned 
    from April 1996, had little choice but to help the LTTE.&nbsp; Many of the 
    young like Deivendran were later&nbsp; picked up by the army and tortured 
    for information about LTTE hiding places and were used as masked informants 
    at identification parades.&nbsp; Several missing persons from the end of 1996 
    were from this area. Deivendran&#146;s only crime as it appears, is that he 
    had seen the LTTE.&nbsp; Another case is that of Ganesh Ramanan (17) of&nbsp;

  <p style='text-align:justify'>The young man was in the trade of erecting platforms 
    for public meetings, which he did for the meeting held with the Army&#146;s 
    approval on this occasion.&nbsp; He had gone to Vanni with his family during 
    the exodus and returned.&nbsp; He was attending the same meeting with two 
    of his friends when they were picked up from the same premises by army intelligence 
    operatives who had earlier served in the LTTE.&nbsp; The three were bound, 
    gagged and blindfolded and left in an abandoned building until an army truck 
    was fetched to take them away.&nbsp; An 8 year old who had been with those 
    detained informed the organisers.&nbsp; The latter made representations to 
    the Army over the impropriety of making arrests at meetings sanctioned by 
    them.&nbsp; The organisers were given to understand that the normal military 
    set up dealing with civil affairs had little influence in the workings of&nbsp; 
    military intelligence.&nbsp; The latter too it transpired placed a great deal 
    of trust in the ex - LTTEers who worked for them.&nbsp; The organisers were 
    told that they would do their best.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Two of those detained with the young man were 
    released that night.&nbsp; The young man was hung&nbsp; upside down blind 
    folded and beaten with S-Lon pipes and kicked with boots.&nbsp; His skin on 
    the hands and back cracked and bled.&nbsp; Persons swinging thick poles beat 
    him about three shots at a time and questioned him.&nbsp; The blindfolded 
    detainee went into paroxysms of shivering every time he heard the shuffling 
    of boots. He was released two days after the arrest, arriving home with raw 
    wounds in a shirt soaked in blood.&nbsp; He is still being treated for bodily

    he was handcuffed, and taken to the upper floor of a building - in Chavakacheri 
    town as he discovered after his release.&nbsp; Here again he was beaten in 
    his chest, back and stomach.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>In the meantime well-wishers ran around from camp 
    to camp demanding his release and protesting that he had no LTTE links, only 
    to receive denials.&nbsp; The detainee was released at 2.00 p.m. the same 
    afternoon. He had received such a fright that just about 3 months later, it 
    led him into a second scrape.&nbsp; He saw soldiers passing his house in Chavakacheri 
    town and quickly got into his house.&nbsp; This had been observed and some

  <h2><a name="_Toc514776188">3.&nbsp;Reaping the Whirlwind</a></h2>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>To the casual observer life in Jaffna looks increasingly 
    normal.&nbsp; The long-suffering resident, as a means to preserving sanity, 
    is strenuously resistant to being reminded of abnormalities.&nbsp; Yet behind 
    the facade, there lies a wounded society, especially among the poorer sections 
    who contributed most to the liberation struggle.&nbsp; Their young joined 
    all the groups.&nbsp; Place names such as Irumpumathavady, Vathiry, Udupiddy, 
    Valvettithurai and Thondamanaru which occur frequently in the news in connection 
    with violent incidents may be mistaken for LTTE strongholds.&nbsp; But on 
    the contrary these were the very places that contributed to a diversity of 
    militant groups and a rich variety of political tendencies.&nbsp; Indeed they 
    suffered significantly during the LTTE&#146;s internal repression.&nbsp; In 
    the early 90s when the LTTE controlled Jaffna, church dignitaries could tell 
    audiences in Colombo and around the world things like:&nbsp; &#147;95% of 
    those in Jaffna support the LTTE.&nbsp; The rest, ..., well... they are Sinhalese!&#148;.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Such claims were plausible to those who ignored 
    the long political history of the struggle only to be charmed by the LTTE&#146;s 
    display of transient power.&nbsp; A particular story illustrates how heart-rending 
    these divisions were to ordinary people who experienced them most intimately.&nbsp; 
    Chinnamma&#146;s (small-mother&#146;s) two elder sisters&#146; sons were in 
    two militant groups.&nbsp; One was Sara, a middle ranking LTTE leader, and 
    the other was in the EPRLF.&nbsp; One day the latter was in her home eating 
    jack fruit.&nbsp; Seeing Sara&#146;s approach, she got him to hide in the 
    lavatory.&nbsp; Sara came, sensing his cousin-brother&#146;s presence, searched 
    the place, found him and killed him.&nbsp; He then took his place in the kitchen 
    to be served as though nothing had happened.&nbsp; During the attack on Jaffna 
    Fort in July - August 1990, Sara led a group that failed to storm the wall.&nbsp; 
    Sara was found crying from his injuries in hospital and was later demoted.&nbsp; 
    He died during the Elephant Pass attack in July 1991.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>The deadly end-game of this legacy is now being 
    played out in hidden recesses.&nbsp; More ironically, the cancer of this legacy 
    has been turned further inwards.&nbsp; Currently a significant number of the 
    LTTE&#146;s targets for assassination are former members of the group and 
    often those who still have close connections with it.&nbsp; In Vadamaratchy 
    itself, the number of LTTE killings in this category from early 1996 number 
    more than a dozen.<a href="#Top">[Top]</a></p>

    are meant for those who died a violent or untimely death.&nbsp; We give below 
    some of the links in the tragedy.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>The history of the Tamil militancy has seen much 
    that was bizarre.&nbsp; The civilian population was left at a loss when beginning 
    from a&nbsp; trickle of secret killings in the70s, the struggle against the&nbsp; 
    &#145;external enemy&#146; was getting swamped in a flood of internal&nbsp; 
    blood-letting by the mid-80s.&nbsp; The more bizarre was yet to come.&nbsp; 
    A few days after the LTTE had murdered TULF leaders Amirthalingam and Yogeswaran 
    in Colombo&nbsp; on 13<sup><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:
6.5pt;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>th</span></sup> July 1989, All-India -Radio announced 
    that in a gun fight in the Vanni jungles between the loyalists of LTTE leader 
    Prabakaran and deputy leader Mahattaya, the former had been killed.&nbsp; 
    The basis of the story is not known, but few were surprised.&nbsp; Now Valvettithurai 
    was the birth place of both, and there was consternation in the coastal village.&nbsp; 
    People demanded to know the truth.&nbsp; After some silence the LTTE issued 
    a photograph which appeared on the cover of the London publication &#145;The 
    Tamil Nation&#146;, showing Prabakaran and Mahattaya smilingly facing each 
    other in a friendly chat.&nbsp; But it did little to end speculation.&nbsp; 
    Mahattaya continued to hold the limelight.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Came January 1990 when the Indian army began its 
    pull-out from Jaffna.&nbsp; A demonstration was organised in Valvettithurai 
    demanding&nbsp; a public appearance of Prabakaran, until the granting of which 
    they refused to entertain the LTTE.&nbsp; During the period prior to the commencement 
    of the war with the Sri Lankan state in June 1990, Mahattaya continued his 
    high profile activity throughout the North-East organising village committees, 
    holding public rallies, and in general building his&nbsp; political base.&nbsp; 
    Good testimony available indicates that the recommencement of the war&nbsp; 
    was not to Mahattaya&#146;s liking.&nbsp; This reading seems to be contradicted 
    by what Mahattaya himself told supporters at closed door meetings prior to 
    the 1990 war. He had told suprised audiences that the war for their ultimate 
    goal of Tamil Eelam would resume in due course. This was only a respite. The 
    allegory he used was that they were running a Marathon of 25 miles and were 
    tired after completing 18. They needed a break, he added. However this seems 
    to suggest that Mahattaya had in mind a significantly longer respite. But 
    in fact the war&nbsp; started barely seventy days after the Indian Army pulled 
    out. From that point there was a progressive isolation of Mahattaya from his 
    positions and supporters.&nbsp; Among his last public acts was to preside 
    over some&nbsp; grisly public executions in the Vanni on 6<sup><span lang=EN-GB

  <p style='text-align:justify'>By May 1993 in a swoop entrusted to the then intelligence 
    chief Pottu Amman, Prabakaran felt confident ernough to arrest Mahattaya and 
    others close to him.&nbsp; The charge that that Mahattaya had connived with 
    the Indian RAW which resulted in Kittu&#146;s suicide in an arms ship apprehended 
    by the Indian navy in January 1993, is hard to evaluate.&nbsp; It is against 
    this history that some hold the commencement of the June 1990 war as having 
    more to do with the LTTE&#146;s internal politics and as a coup against Mahattaya.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>In the event the people of Valvettithurai demonstrated 
    again, this time on behalf of Mahattaya, saying that they had done the same 
    for Prabakaran in 1990 when they feared for his well-being&nbsp; and safety.&nbsp; 
    Mahattaya was not seen again.&nbsp; He was allowed to exchange a few letters 
    with his wife.&nbsp; Among the last instructions he gave her was to send their 
    daughter Kalaiyarasi to a particular nursery teacher to learn English.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>In October 1995 Anton Balasingam told an Indian 
    correspondent&nbsp; for the &#145;Outlook&#146; that Mahattaya had been executed.&nbsp; 
    This is not being treated as the last word on the matter.&nbsp; Claims have 
    been made that he has since been seen in the Vanni, or that he is in a special 
    prison for the &#145;living dead&#146;, whose function to serve as organic 
    reference manuals.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>As fate would have it, Pottu Amman has not been 
    seen for some time.&nbsp; According to stories circulated by returnees to 
    Jaffna from the Vanni, he is under a cloud, if not behind bars.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Be that as it may, since 1993 the heaviness of 
    the air of conspiracy within the LTTE has taken a jump of several notches.&nbsp; 
    &#145;Mahattaya&#146;s man&#146; has become another euphemism for &#145;traitor&#146;.&nbsp; 
    There have been many reports of LTTE men who claimed to have escaped from 
    custody, both here and in India, being killed on suspicion by their own group.&nbsp; 
    The affair also had its repercussions within the LTTE, the community at large, 
    and not least in Valvettithurai itself.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Mahattaya had after all been a powerful man with 
    many&nbsp; contacts.&nbsp; From April 1996 in particular as the Sri Lankan 
    army marched into Thenmaratchy and Vadamaratchy, a significant number of LTTE 
    cadre surrendered to the army.&nbsp; Notably this was also about the time 
    the LTTE began killing several of its own former members.&nbsp; The phenomenon 
    as it turned out was quite marked around Valvettithurai. Memorial verses for 
    the departed from dear ones are reflective of loss and anguished soul searching 
    rather than of anger.&nbsp; The first incident below has a poignant setting 
    that is illustrative of several before it and of others that were to follow.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Selvadas Nuveskumar (24), known in the LTTE as 
    Babu, had left the group,&nbsp; married&nbsp; Kulasiri, and was settled in 
    Commathurai, Valvettithurai.&nbsp; The day was 15<sup><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:6.5pt;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>th</span></sup> February 1997 
    after nightfall, when two men came to house in Sri Lankan army uniform and 
    asked for Babu.&nbsp; Kulasiri who was nursing their second child, then a 
    few days old, although suspecting them to be members of the LTTE, could not 
    identify them.&nbsp; She told them that Babu was out.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Later in the same evening Major Thenamuthan of 
    the LTTE entered their home.&nbsp; Kulasiri recognised him and her earlier 
    suspicions were confirmed.&nbsp; Thenamtuhan lifted their infant child, said, 
    &#145;So this must be your second&#146;, and kissed it.&nbsp; At this time 
    Babu came in through another entrance and immediately had a premonition of 
    the purpose of the visit, having known the organisation extremely well. &nbsp;Having 
    been moulded and schooled within it, he accepted its will as one would an 
    iron fate, and made no attempt at evasion.&nbsp; He told Thenamuthan firmly, 
    &#147;If you want to do anything to me, take me out and do it.&nbsp; Don&#146;t 
    do it in the presence of my wife&#148;.&nbsp; Thenamuthan denied having any 
    intention of causing him harm and took him out.&nbsp; Some time passed and 
    Kulasiri heard 3 or 4 gunshots.&nbsp; She stood transfixed for half an hour.&nbsp; 
    Then she went out with some others who came to her aid.&nbsp; After some searching, 
    the light of the lamp fell on the sprawled form of her beloved, stilled forever.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>The killing was never acknowledged by the LTTE.&nbsp; 
    Rumours were circulated instead that the Army had done the deed.&nbsp; The 
    memorial verse to him from the family read:</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    &#147;His exemplary life which was true to its principles,</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    &nbsp; and the excellence he displayed in his vocation,</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    &nbsp; will serve as a guide to future generations&#148;.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Kulasiri now works for a government owned sales 
    outlet in Pt. Pedro.&nbsp; Major Thenamuthan followed his victim on 16<sup><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-size:6.5pt;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>th</span></sup> December 
    1997.&nbsp; This episode is dealt with in the next section. </p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Later in the year an LTTE cadre named Rahu was 
    about the Valvettithurai - Uduppiddy area.&nbsp; Quite often when he was seen, 
    the Army was soon about the place.&nbsp; Word got around in the area that 
    the Army did not want to shoot him but rather wanted to catch him alive.&nbsp; 
    One day about mid-June the Army surrounded him at Imayanan junction on the 
    Valvettithurai - Uduppiddy Road.&nbsp; Rahu took his life swallowing cyanide.&nbsp; 
    The LTTE was evidently angry about the outcome.&nbsp; Perhaps such incidents 
    were more sensitive in an area that was the Leader&#146;s&nbsp; home, where 
    all available social institutions had been used to articulate the picture 
    of a monolithic LTTE base, that was only slightly disturbed by the humiliation 
    and fall of Deputy Leader Mahattaya, also from that area.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>In due course some LTTE cadre arrived where Rahu 
    had fallen, strewed flowers, and vowed that some &#145;heads would roll&#146; 
    for what had happened.&nbsp; In a bid to halt the flow of information and 
    drive terror into would-be informers, the LTTE hit out blindly, taking few 
    chances.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Sritharan (30) whose memorial notice was referred 
    to had served 10 years in the LTTE.&nbsp; He had left the organisation 3 years 
    before, followed his father&#146;s trade of farming, and lived with his parents.&nbsp; 
    Coming from a family of 3 boys and 2 girls, his younger brother was a serving 
    member of the LTTE, having joined 10 years ago, and a sister too was also 
    in the LTTE, having completed 2 years.&nbsp; While Sritharan was at home with 
    his father and mother, the LTTE came home and called him for a chat.&nbsp; 
    They then shot him dead and left a notice with the charges: 1.) Aided the 
    Army 2.) Betrayed members of the LTTE and 3.) Traitor to the Tamils.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;
mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>Sources close to the family opined that the younger brother 
    too had been finished off as he may have been identified as a loyalist of 
    Mahattaya, since nothing had been heard of him for a long time.</span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;
mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>It was ironically on the 45</span><sup><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-size:6.5pt;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>th</span></sup> day 
    religious rites for Sritharan that his assassin, identified as &#145;Hitler&#146;, 
    made, as it were, his destined date with Kalan (the god fate, death or destiny).&nbsp; 
    At dusk on 14<sup><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:6.5pt;
mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>th</span></sup> August 1997, the Army on receipt of information 
    were aloft a tree in Vellai (i.e. White or Uduppiddy - Pt. Pedro) Road, between 
    the Co-op and the American Mission School at the junction.&nbsp; Below, 3 
    LTTE cadre arrived for the appointed meeting with 3 helpers.&nbsp; The army 
    opened fire killing &#145;Hitler&#146;.&nbsp; The other two LTTE cadre made 
    their escape.&nbsp; The three civilian helpers were arrested and were after 
    interrogation transferred to police custody.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Hitler&#146;s story is itself a tragedy.&nbsp; 
    His mother lived not half a mile from the spot where he was killed.&nbsp; 
    His father was in Colombo, but had not been sending money home.&nbsp; The 
    mother had the burden of looking after the family.&nbsp; Hitler had been recruited 
    by an outworn cause in aid of which poorer members of the same community were 
    being cornered into destroying each other.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>About this same time another incident took place 
    a short distance away in Ilakkanawattai, Valvettithurai, on the Uduppiddy 
    Road at a playing field.&nbsp; The 19 year old boy was mentally weak and was 
    in general friendly with anyone who was so with him.&nbsp; His elder brother 
    who had been 8 years in the LTTE , had left the organisation and is presently 
    out of Jaffna.&nbsp; The boy was in&nbsp; a group either playing or watching 
    a game of volley ball.&nbsp; Some LTTE cadre had arrived, among whom two were 
    said to have been known as Sentil and Thakkali, and called the boy for a chat.&nbsp; 
    The boy went and sat with them on the wall of a nearby Christian cemetery.&nbsp; 
    In the course of an awkward conversation the boy said innocently and plaintively, 
    &#147;It looks as if you are going to shoot me&#148;!</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Members of the public who heard it immediately 
    came forward and protested.&nbsp; The LTTE cadre shot the boy and ran away.&nbsp; 
    The Army soon came there and took the boy to Valvettithurai hospital.&nbsp; 
    He was sent then to Pt. Pedro hospital, where he died after being operated 
    on.&nbsp; It is opined locally that the LTTE killed the boy on the surmise 
    that he was too much of a simpleton to risk having around.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>The business of rolling heads went on.&nbsp; On 
    the night of the 22<sup><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:6.5pt;mso-ansi-language:
EN-GB'>nd</span></sup> October, 8 LTTE cadre wearing army uniform arrived at the 
    home of Sivaprakasam Jayantha (18), a mason at Udayar Lane, Imayanan.&nbsp; 
    They shot him dead in the presence of his elder sister and her husband.&nbsp; 
    The killers went away telling them that they would give the reason for this 
    action when &#145;Our kingdom comes&#146;.&nbsp; Again, ironically, two younger 
    sisters of Jayantha are still members of the LTTE.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;
mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>On 17</span><sup><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:
6.5pt;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>th</span></sup> November 1997 the Army was using 
    forced, unpaid labour from civilians to clear the shrubs on either side of 
    a lonely stretch of the VVT - Thondamanaru Road.&nbsp; There was a ruined 
    bus shelter at a&nbsp; point where the road took a sharp bend and then a steep 
    climb.&nbsp; When the party reached this point a claymore mine exploded, injuring 
    a soldier and a youth in the clearing party.&nbsp; Just then some youths were 
    seen running away through the undergrowth.&nbsp; The soldiers took aim and 
    fired mortar shells into a particular area..&nbsp; Then upon searching the 
    area the soldiers recovered two bodies.&nbsp; The civilians could not identify 
    the bodies that were taken away immediately, but they did notice that national 
    identity cards and army residence permits were recovered from the bodies.&nbsp; 
  </p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>A few days prior to this incident, some families 
    in Thondamanaru whose sons were in the LTTE had been questioned by the Army 
    about the presence of their sons in the area.&nbsp; The father of one had 
    been treated badly.&nbsp; For many days after the incident the families did 
    not know who had fallen casualty. </p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Now we come to the third press item.&nbsp; About 
    9.30 PM on 15<sup><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:6.5pt;mso-ansi-language:
EN-GB'>th</span></sup> December about ten members of the LTTE arrived at the house 
    of the village headman of Thondamanaru, K. Arulanantham (35).&nbsp; He was 
    taken to a place where the ground was covered with flood water from the rains.&nbsp; 
    As becomes that area, a number of relatives followed protesting.&nbsp; Others 
    in desperation went to get help from the Army. A few in the LTTE party stood 
    guard with automatic weapons while others started belabouring the hapless 
    headman with long rods.&nbsp; Following the third blow, the headman collapsed 
    into the shallow water.&nbsp; Immediately his brother-in-law dashed past the 
    guards and fell upon him to protect him from further blows.&nbsp; The LTTE 
    wrenched away the protesting brother-in-law, and continued to rain blows on 
    the fallen victim. </p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>The assailants left after warning the relatives 
    and neighbours that &#145;no one should touch the body&#146;.&nbsp; A short 
    time after they left, the Army arrived in a hiring car.&nbsp; The headman 
    was found to be alive, but badly mauled, although the assailants&#146; last 
    words indicated they had left him for dead.&nbsp; the Army explained that 
    they had delayed coming as they had anticipated that the LTTE would have posted 
    guards, leading to crossfire where others were bound to get hurt.&nbsp; The 
    Army took the headman to Pt Pedro hospital, from where he was transferred 
    to Jaffna hospital.&nbsp; He was being treated for a broken rib-cage and multiple 
    fractures on a thigh and legs.&nbsp; The only reason the LTTE had for suspecting 
    headmen is that their duties involved regular dealings with the Army.&nbsp; 
    However nearly all the younger headmen were appointed when the LTTE controlled 
    junior administrative appointments in Jaffna.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Over the two days that followed several key LTTE 
    infiltrators in Vadamaratchy died in Army searches of their hideouts around 
    Nelliady.&nbsp; Some of those killed were among those responsible for the 
    incidents above.&nbsp; This brings us to the next item.<a href="#Top">[Top]</a></p>
  <h2><a name="_Toc514776190">3.2. &nbsp; Vathiry - Nelliady:&nbsp; The Burrows 
    of&nbsp; Death</a></h2>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>It may not be too fanciful to suppose that the 
    LTTE killings in the last section that were in one instance precautionary 
    and in others based on wild guesswork, were meant to pave the way for infiltration 
    by fairly&nbsp; senior members of the LTTE.&nbsp; Vadamaratchy had become 
    a sore point for the LTTE, which once vaunted as its main support base, had 
    under the command of Brigadier Larry Wijeratne come to enjoy markedly good 
    relations with the Army.&nbsp; People referred to Wijeratne with the kind 
    of endearment ordinarily reserved for a popular member of parliament who is 
    about&nbsp; the place solving their problems and keeping life going.&nbsp; 
    The LTTE therefore had a huge stake in disrupting what prevailed.&nbsp; With 
    the approach of&nbsp; National Heroes Day (27<sup><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:6.5pt;mso-ansi-language:
EN-GB'>th</span></sup> November) it was natural for the LTTE to plan for a sensational 
    attack calculated to provoke reprisals somewhere near the Leader&#146;s birthplace.&nbsp; 
    It is also notable that the LTTE had then been more active there than in the 
    Pt Pedro area.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;
mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>If this reading is correct, it would also have been natural 
    for the LTTE to find places to hide and rest in the Nelliady - Vathiry area 
    which is largely agricultural, from where Valvettithurai and Uduppiddy, 2 
    or 3 miles westerly, could be accessed through lanes, and there was an escape

    1 1/2hours from 8.00 AM.&nbsp; Two injured soldiers, it said,&nbsp; were taken 
    to Pt Pedro Hospital and then to Palaly.&nbsp; Five dead bodies from the incident 
    were attributed to unconfirmed reports.&nbsp; Conditions governing the press 
    in Jaffna are such that the want of accuracy and depth concerning local events 
    sensitive to the LTTE, contrasts sharply with the space and prominence given 
    to articles and items from the Southern press favourable to the LTTE.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>What follows is again a story of how it is the 
    weakest in&nbsp; society;&nbsp; trying to find breathing space in a life where 
    modern pressures on a traditional society, combined with those from years

  <p style='text-align:justify'><b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;
mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>Irumpumathavady</span></b></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>The widowed mother, a farmer, and her youngest, 
    a daughter, lived by themselves at Pulavarodai, Irumpumathavady.&nbsp; Her 
    husband had committed suicide. Of her two elder children the son had committed 
    suicide, and the daughter who was married resided in Germany. The LTTE&#146;s 
    attentions to them began some time before September 1997, when Major Thenamuthan 
    came when the daughter was alone and asked for food.&nbsp; He was evidently 
    part of an advance party tasked with finding hiding places.&nbsp; The daughter 
    refused.&nbsp; She later told the mother of it.&nbsp; She held no firm resolution 
    on the matter.&nbsp; As time went Thenamuthan got into the habit of coming 
    into the kitchen and helping himself to what was available.&nbsp; He was also 
    suspicious of the daughter who on occasions protested.&nbsp; Once after an 
    argument he beat her on the back of her head causing her to faint.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>As the next step Thenamuthan came with about two 
    others to look around.&nbsp; The daughter threatened to report the matter 
    to the Army, saying that they were decent to them and who because they were 
    two women were living alone, were lenient during their routine searches.&nbsp; 
    She wanted to preserve their good name with the Army, she added.&nbsp; Thenamuthan 
    threatened her with a revolver.&nbsp; He came the next day and beat her.&nbsp; 
    The mother protested saying that she was weak.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Three months before the incident, in mid-September, 
    some building materials and tools were at home owing to a new kitchen being 
    built.&nbsp; After the mason and his men left for the day, Thenamuthan came 
    with Arunan and two others.&nbsp; Arunan was credited locally with the assassination 
    of about half a dozen former members of the LTTE soon after the Army took 
    control of Vadamaratchy in April 1996.&nbsp; The visitors ordered the mother 
    and daughter to stay in a room saying that they had a secret job to do.&nbsp; 
    The daughter screamed, fainted and then slept.&nbsp; The LTTE men left four 
    hours later about 8.30 PM, having mostly completed the work for an underground 
    bunker.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>About 4 days later Thenamuthan came home with 
    Lt. Col. Archunar, a senior Sea Tiger credited with being deputy to the ST 
    leader Soosai.&nbsp; Thenamuthan did the talking, explaining that they would 
    stay in the place once in a while.&nbsp; A few weeks later supplies were brought 
    to the bunker in urea bags.&nbsp; About two weeks before Maaveerar Thinam 
    (National Heroes Day - 27<sup><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:6.5pt;mso-ansi-language:
EN-GB'>th</span></sup> November), the mother&nbsp; and daughter were anxiously 
    discussing the prospect of their guests planning something big.&nbsp; The 
    daughter asked whether they should tell the Army.&nbsp; Just then Archunar 
    arrived with Thenamuthan and asked what they had been discussing.&nbsp; The 
    mother said that it was a marriage proposal for the daughter and her impending 
    journey to Colombo in that connection.&nbsp; Archunar said that it was a lie 
    and that they were talking about telling the Army.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Thenamuthan proceeded to beat the girl.&nbsp; 
    When the mother intervened between the two, Aruchunar pushed her.&nbsp; The 
    well built woman fell heavily on her right arm, fracturing her forearm in 
    two places.&nbsp; Archunar instructed her to seek medication, adding that 
    they should not breathe a word about the real cause nor allude to their presence 
    even to a close relative.&nbsp; Should they do so, he threatened, they and 
    their relatives would all be killed.&nbsp; The mother got the hand plastered 
    at Manthikai (Pt. Pedro) Hospital and let it be known that she had slipped 
    and fallen at the well.&nbsp; The two guests continued using the house once 
    in a way.</p>

    Thenamuthan and two others entered the burrow.&nbsp; Early in the morning 
    the house was surrounded by the Army.&nbsp; There can be no completely satisfactory 
    account of how the Army came to know, as Archunar&#146;s movements by night 
    were a closely guarded secret which the neighbours would hardly have known 
    about.&nbsp; The Sunday Leader account refers to a special intelligencer.&nbsp; 
    Our sources speak of&nbsp; the apprehension by the Army of a courier who carried 
    messages between hideouts.&nbsp; The officer and men who entered the house 
    found only the mother and daughter.&nbsp; After a search the officer radioed 
    Brigade HQ that they found nothing.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Back came the reply, there definitely is something, 
    go on looking.&nbsp; The officer noticed the daughter becoming uneasy as they 
    resumed the search.&nbsp; He then spotted a crack in the floor under the glass 
    cabinet, and ordered the men to examine it.&nbsp; The mother ran into another 
    room to drink pesticide, but was prevented from doing so.&nbsp; By this time 
    the soldiers had opened the burrow.&nbsp; According to their account a grenade 
    lobbed from within the burrow bounced off some obstruction, went back inside 
    and exploded, killing the four inmates.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>There were found in the burrow arms, detonators, 
    ammunition and rocket propelled grenades.&nbsp; As to subsequent extensive 
    damage to the house, according to the Army, in order to make sure that they 
    do not leave behind explosives that could be recovered for use later, it was 
    their practice to set off&nbsp; a small explosion.&nbsp; Accordingly, this 
    was done by an explosives expert trained abroad.&nbsp; But this resulted in 
    a huge explosion owing to further explosives that must have been stored further 
    inside the burrow.</p>

mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>Nelliady</span></b></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>The house was one in which 3 sisters lived together, 
    the youngest being 21, who had been displaced from Valvetty. The eldest was 
    married with a daughter followed by 3 sons, aged 11, 9 and 7 years old.&nbsp; 
    Her husband had deserted her.&nbsp; The two younger sisters were spinsters.&nbsp; 
    The youngest had passed her A Levels and while the LTTE controlled Jaffna, 
    it had helped her by giving her a job in a sewing centre run by them and a 
    house in Nelliady.&nbsp; Before the LTTE quit Vadamaratchy in April 1996, 
    they had moved them to a new house.&nbsp; Once the Army arrived, they explained 
    their predicament to the military authorities and got permission to stay where 
    they were.&nbsp; The eldest made an income by pasting paper bags and making 
    kadaiappam (hoppers).&nbsp; The middle sister controlled domestic affairs.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>One day Thenamuthan came there and insisted that 
    the sisters should help them. The middle sister protested.&nbsp; Thenamuthan 
    responded, &#145;Where can we then go?&#146; He finally prevailed using the 
    fact that the LTTE had earlier helped them.&nbsp; First Archunar used the 
    house, and later others came.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;
mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>The house was surrounded by the Army on the morning of 
    18</span><sup><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:6.5pt;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>th</span></sup> 
    December.&nbsp; The house was searched and nothing was found.&nbsp; The ladies 
    and the children were questioned individually.&nbsp; The older ones yielded 
    nothing.&nbsp; A behavioural nuance of the youngest alerted the officer.&nbsp; 
    Suddenly one man came out of his hiding place and began firing.&nbsp; The 
    soldiers in the house took the inmates and withdrew.&nbsp; The fire was returned 
    by the crew of the Army&#146;s Buffel armoured car stationed nearby.&nbsp; 
    The man firing from near the roof top was killed.&nbsp; Later there was an 
    explosion.&nbsp; Altogether 5 corpses were found.&nbsp; One was severed into 
    two, the head having fallen far away, suggesting the use of a suicide kit.&nbsp; 
    As to the hiding place, the wall separating&nbsp; two rooms, it was found, 
    was cleverly made into a cavity 1 1/2 feet wide.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>The eldest sister revealed a circumstance pertaining&nbsp; 
    to the youngest.&nbsp; There had been a marriage proposal for her from a relative 
    in Germany of her husband.&nbsp; She and the middle sister were planning to 
    go to Colombo in this connection and were discussing it.&nbsp; At this point 
    Lt. Col. Archunar who overheard it intervened and said authoritatively that 
    their sister cannot marry!</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>The two stories are revealing in themselves.&nbsp; 
    In the case of the first hiding place which involved a much higher degree 
    of coercion, intimidation and risk arising from the daughter&#146;s open hostility 
    to their presence, the LTTE may still have deemed the place safer owing to 
    the family having no known previous LTTE connection.&nbsp; It was also, considering 
    Archunar&#146;s rank, a game with high stakes, which for the present at least, 
    came to naught.&nbsp; If one considers the conduct of&nbsp; Archunar and Thenamuthan 
    as saboteurs operating under the constraints of an alien and hostile environment, 
    it cannot be judged ignoble.&nbsp; Under those circumstances it was disciplined 
    and restrained.&nbsp; But that is the point.&nbsp; It had by far ceased to 
    be the conduct of a liberation group moving among a spontaneously sympathetic 
    population who recognised them as liberators.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;
mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>According to our sources, the civilians detained by the 
    Army, although extensively questioned, had not been tortured up to at least 
    the time they were in the custody of the Army at Pt. Pedro.</span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>We record a particular circumstance concerning 
    the first case of the widow and daughter at Irumpumathavady which shows how 
    the LTTE&#146;s web entangled the same people from diverse directions, stealing 
    over almost unsuspectingly.&nbsp; The elder daughter&#146;s father-in-law 
    had first gone to Germany, and later, about 1992, wanted his two sons and 
    daughter, who was the youngest, to join him in Germany.&nbsp; By then the 
    LTTE&#146;s pass system was in operation, requiring a member of the family 
    to be left behind.&nbsp; His wife and two sons (one of whom later married 
    the widow&#146;s elder daughter) went to Germany, leaving behind his 12 year 
    old daughter as a &#145;bond&#146; with her Periyamma (mother&#146;s elder 
    sister).&nbsp; In a rash moment, about two years later, the young girl joined 
    the LTTE and is now trapped.&nbsp; Should she wish to leave, she may be sent 
    on a risky operation as part of the punishment.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>A comparatively rare irony facing the parents 
    is that in Germany they have to live cheek-by-jowl with boastful LTTE supporters 
    from the same part of&nbsp; Jaffna, having no worries about offspring in the 
    Vanni.&nbsp; They have to bear in silence the talk about the highly sophisticated 
    movement having gone a considerable way towards taking over the world. For 
    their part, they can only hope to move heaven with tears to get their daughter 
    out of the movement&#146;s primitive hell-hole in the Vanni, into which the 
    girl had fallen in an unguarded moment.&nbsp; More ironical is the fact that 
    this young girl who would have been in Germany, was in the first place entrapped 
    by a pass system so contrary in spirit to that of asylum in Germany; which 
    on the other hand was being enforced with the aid of Tamil beneficiaries of 
    German asylum on their own hapless people.<a href="#Top">[Top]</a></p>

    </span></u></h2>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Sinnapody Selvaranee (28) is a dumb spinster living 
    with her mother in Vembirai, Meesalai North, Themaratchy.&nbsp; During the 
    morning of the day she had taken her mother on her bicycle to a medical clinic 
    in Chavakacheri, bought her back home and later proceeded again towards Meesalai 
    South to see a seamstress colleague of hers.&nbsp; Not long after, she returned 
    home.&nbsp; Smelling kerosene, relatives living closeby rushed in to find 
    that Selvaranee had doused herself with kerosene and was attempting to immolate 
    herself.&nbsp; Having stopped her in the nick of time, they discovered her 
    bleeding from the vagina.&nbsp; She had also communicated to them that some 
    soldiers, reportedly near the Meesalai army check point, had pointed a knife, 
    tied her eyes, taken her to a covert and raped her.&nbsp; She was admitted 
    to Chavakacheri Hospital and was transferred to Jaffna Hospital by 6.00PM 
    the same day.&nbsp; Much of this appeared in the Uthayan of 18.3.98.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>The Uthayan of 22.3 carried an item under the 
    title &#147;Further Clarifications...&#148;&nbsp; These clarifications were 
    said to come from &#145;concerned parties&#146;, whom the context indicates 
    were the military authorities.&nbsp; The relevant information emerging from 
    this &#145;clarification&#146; is that Selvaranee had a tear inside the vagina 
    causing heavy bleeding.&nbsp; She had been anaesthetised and the bleeding 
    was stopped by stitching the tear.&nbsp; Most importantly, according to the 
    medical report, owing to the heavy bleeding no substances could be extracted 
    that could establish rape.&nbsp; All that could be said was that there had 
    been deep penetration of the vagina by a blunt object.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>The rest of the &#145;clarification&#146; is an 
    argument where the flaws point to evident discomfort: 1.) No complaint of 
    criminal sexual assault had been made to the police or to any judicial authority.&nbsp; 
    2.) The medical report is inconclusive of rape.&nbsp; 3.)Because the woman&#146;s 
    eyes were tied while she was subject to the violent act and she is deaf and 
    dumb, she is in no position to know or testify as regards ascribing guilt.&nbsp; 
    4.)The Army top brass have categorically denied guilt on the part of any of 
    their personnel.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>On the other hand, in accepting the medical report 
    and the part in the woman&#146;s story of her eyes having been tied in its 
    argument, the Army has gone a long way in exonerating her as a credible witness.&nbsp; 
    The hard facts are that she left home, an external agent or agents had painfully 
    and forcibly penetrated her vagina, leaving her in a state where she wanted 
    to take her own life.&nbsp; Evidently the place and circumstances in which 
    someone pointed a knife at her and took her away from the road left her in 
    little doubt about who the party was.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>According to sources contacted by us, the lady 
    stands by her story, her relatives say that it was the Army and some of the 
    soldiers in the area too had told people that there are some bad guys among 
    them.&nbsp; We also understand that there is little interest among the people 
    in pushing matters further.&nbsp; The main reason for this seems to boil down 
    to society giving little value to a dumb spinster past the first flush of 
    youth with minimal prospects of marriage.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Routine police work could have established a good 
    deal more, and so could have the military authorities if they were serious.&nbsp; 
    It is also interesting that Major General Balagalle, the Jaffna commander, 
    who was quoted in the Weekend Express of 28.3.98 has acknowledged the incident, 
    but for the rest was non-committal.&nbsp; He did not associate himself with 
    the &#145;categorical denial&#146; cited by the &#145;concerned parties&#146; 
    who spoke to the Uthayan a few days earlier.&nbsp; Balagalle who is generally 
    prompt and forthcoming only spoke of having &#145;just received information 
    that can throw more light on the matter&#146;, but has not said anything more 
    to date.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Even the point about no one complaining&nbsp; 
    to the police or to the judicial authorities does not give any credit to the 
    Army.&nbsp; In Special Report No.6 of August 1996 we recorded another case 
    in the same area - in Manthuvil West adjacent to Vembirai, where Selvaranee 
    hails from.&nbsp; On 17<sup><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:6.5pt;mso-ansi-language:
EN-GB'>th</span></sup> May 1996 three women were raped and three men and a child 
    were chopped to death.&nbsp; Thangaraja Puvaneswary (36) who was one of the 
    rape victims testified that the Army had been responsible.&nbsp; The matter 
    was simply ignored and covered up.&nbsp; Is it therefore surprising that no 
    one complained about Selvaranee&#146;s case?&nbsp; What guarantees do they 
    have, or what can they expect?</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>This case is now a challenge to the Human Rights 
    Commission and to concerned NGOs.&nbsp; The Commission itself has some able 
    and experienced persons.&nbsp; But trends suggest that they will not get far 
    without the active support of citizens&#146; groups and NGOs.&nbsp; A good 
    example is the case of Rev. Arulpalan, a priest belonging to an established 
    church - the JDCSI - who was killed by the Army in August 1997.&nbsp; The 
    JDCSI is a member of the National Christian Council which is supported by 
    several churches and has a Justice &amp; Peace Commission that is endowed 
    with a full-time staff.&nbsp; If a case particularly of Arulpalan&#146;s nature 
    cannot be carried beyond the realm of anti-government propaganda towards providing 
    relief to those affected and contributing to reform, it would be wrong to 
    blame one party alone.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>There are already some disturbing indications 
    that a section of the security establishment is conspiring to destroy the 
    credibility of the Human Rights Commission even before it could establish 
    any.&nbsp; In a recent case of a Tamil youth detained in Kandy, the HRC intervened.&nbsp; 
    A detention order was obtained by the CSU under the PTA, deliberately&nbsp; 
    suppressing the fact that the NIB had cleared the detainee within 3 hours.&nbsp; 
    Strong hints were dropped even at DIG level that the youth was being punished 
    only&nbsp; because of HRC involvement.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;
mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>It all comes down to the fact that after nearly 4 years 
    of the PA government hardly anyone - certainly no one of rank - has been punished. 
    Confidence has grown within the security establishment that they could ignore 
    their nominal Commander-in-Chief&#146;s strictures and directives on human 
    rights and get away with any abuse.</span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp; </p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>There is now more than a little space in Jaffna.&nbsp; 
    Is it not time for civil society to demonstrate that it could tackle a case 
    such as that of the Selvaranee&#146;s, upholding the dignity of the victim 
    and of the community without being overtaken by destructive elements?</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>While the government continues to dither over 
    human rights, the LTTE has already played its card in the international arena.&nbsp; 
    Its bulletin stated:&nbsp; &#147;The Sinhalese soldiers this week gang-raped 
    a deaf and dumb Tamil girl in Meesalai in occupied Jaffna...Behaving like 
    an invading&nbsp; army centuries ago, the Sinhalese armed forces who occupied 
    Jaffna in 1995 have raped many Tamil women.&#148; <a href="#Top">[Top]</a></p>

    Pedro: </span></b>Nagendran Kularuban (18) of Alambil, Chemmalai in the Mullaitivu 
    District was a former LTTEer then with army intelligence.&nbsp; He and another 
    soldier had been moving about earlier on bicycles.&nbsp; This day seems to 
    have been the first occasion on which they got out unarmed.&nbsp; About 6.00 
    PM they were fired at on Main Rd. near the bus depot.&nbsp; The assailants 
    took to their heels running through the lanes.&nbsp; The fact that they had 
    been asking for directions on the way indicated that they were new infiltrators 
    unfamiliar with the area - a departure from the LTTE&#146;s practice of using 
    natives as infiltrators.&nbsp; According to shop keepers in the area the assailants 
    had called at a shop in the location twice that afternoon to purchase noodles 
    and beer.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>This also brings into focus another problem.&nbsp; 
    The LTTE which exercised totalitarian power in the area for the better part 
    of 10 years, left behind a population, a significant number of whom are hardly 
    in a position to refuse occasional requests from the LTTE.&nbsp; Obviously 
    there a had been a spotter who had communicated to the LTTE the regular peregrinations 
    of the two intelligence men.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>A large number of soldiers were deployed in the 
    area.&nbsp; Kularuban died later at Palaly, but the other had been killed 
    immediately.&nbsp; Three of the soldiers deployed had gone off the leash and 
    assaulted some shop owners, a householder and some bystanders with their hands.&nbsp; 
    One of them doused a kerosene boutique owner with the stuff and was threatening 
    to set him ablaze.&nbsp; The soldiers were saying that they could be punished 
    for what they were doing, but these people must nevertheless be punished for 
    disclaiming knowledge of the assailants.&nbsp; Just then a jeep with policemen 
    arrived on the scene who tried to stop the soldiers from assaulting the civilians, 
    arguing with them that they were playing into the hands of the LTTE by doing 
    exactly what it wanted them to do.&nbsp; These soldiers also had some harsh 
    words for Brigadier Larry Wijeratne whom they blamed for having tied their 
    hands, if not for which they would not have spared anyone when one of theirs 
    was killed.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>The crisis passed with no further harm.&nbsp; 
    The main road was soon deserted and people used lanes to bypass the area for 
    the rest of the evening.&nbsp; Within two days, talk about the incident had 
    largely ceased.&nbsp; Upon the return of Brigadier Wijeratne who had been 
    in Colombo, those who misbehaved, it is said, were identified and punished.</p>

    Mirusuvil: </b>The incident was reported in the Colombo press under such headings 
    as &#147;Child shields for cowards&#148; and &#147;Mirusuvil massacre&#148;.&nbsp; 
    The imputation was that the LTTE dressed in school uniform had fired at a 
    foot patrol from behind school children, causing the troops to withhold their 
    fire and take casualties for the fear of hitting school children.&nbsp; It 
    is true that on several occasions LTTE cadre dressed in school uniform had 
    thrown grenades at troops while hiding behind civilians and school children.&nbsp; 
    But nothing like it happened this time and bad reporting can make people sceptical 
    every time due credit is given to troop conduct.&nbsp; Indeed, much credit 
    is due to them in this incident for the restraint observed.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>A day or a few days before the incident, the Army 
    received a tip off about an LTTE presence in the area near the school.&nbsp; 
    Soldiers started going to the area as though to do a round up, then called 
    it off and withdrew.&nbsp; On the day concerned again there was apparently 
    a similar tip off and the soldiers converged on the area in groups from several 
    directions.&nbsp; It seems likely that they had not expected more than 10 
    LTTE cadre as would normally have been the case.&nbsp; But this time there 
    were 30 to 40 in their uniform according to local information, who were ready 
    with a trap for the advancing troops.&nbsp; It is said by these sources that 
    one of the groups of soldiers was isolated, pinned down, and a battle ensued.&nbsp; 
    About 20 minutes of exchange of fire left 7 troops dead. Two members of the 
    LTTE were also killed according to LTTE Radio.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>It is correct that school sessions had just ended 
    at the time of fighting .&nbsp; School children had been on the road and had 
    taken cover. No one was hurt during or after the incident.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Another relevant circumstance is that the LTTE 
    had been using the area to meet civilians whom it summoned by letter.&nbsp; 
    Often the meeting was called off without notice and another letter sent.&nbsp; 
    LTTE cadre who came there from the uncleared area of Vadamaratchy East through 
    Varany, are under the command of Veeman. The Army genarally stays close to 
    the main Kandy Road and avoids the lanes. <a href="#Top">[Top]</a></p>
  <h2><a name="_Toc514776194">4.3&nbsp; Some cases of civilian death or injury 
    due to Army action</a></h2>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>We concentrate on a few incidents which strongly 
    suggest that there needs to be careful monitoring and regular meetings between 
    the monitoring bodies and the military authorities if standards are to improve.&nbsp; 
    The present situation in which the Army has the last word is very unsatisfactory.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>In none of the cases below of persons shot during 
    curfew hours, presumably as curfew breakers, could the victim be said to have 
    been a member of the LTTE or to have posed a threat to security.&nbsp; In 
    two cases below, the victims were not even curfew breakers.&nbsp; The case 
    of the teacher below, shot on&nbsp; 6/12/97, was killed inside his own premises.&nbsp; 
    Three others were law breakers in a milder category.&nbsp; All available reports 
    suggest that whenever members of the LTTE were killed, they were killed in 
    situations where they were more or less clearly identified, such as&nbsp; 
    during&nbsp; a confrontation. The nebulous nature of the law as it stands, 
    and the lack of definition, has neither been helpful in protecting civilian 
    interests, nor in guiding the armed forces to see clearly the task at hand.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>In the old days there was something called &#145;martial 
    law&#146; under which people knew what to expect.&nbsp; Nowadays &#145;normalcy&#146;, 
    &#145;emergency&#146;, &#145;emergency regulations&#146; &amp; &#145;curfew&#146; 
    can all co-exist at one and the same time, and are used by the authorities 
    as it suits them.&nbsp; When the Government itself goes on claiming over the 
    radio that it has restored &#145;normalcy&#146; in Jaffna, one could hardly 
    blame &nbsp;a civilian thinking it harmless to take a short bicycle ride at 
    9.00 PM - for which, in&nbsp; a case below, a man paid with his life.</p>

  <p style='text-align:justify'><b>Mutthu Saroja :&nbsp; Killed 28</b><b><sup><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-size:6.5pt;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>th</span></sup> August 
    1997:&nbsp; </b>Saro was a 35 year old lady of Hill Country origin, who had 
    come to Jaffna as a refugee several years ago. She was a widowed mother of&nbsp; 
    3 children who worshipped at Zion Church, Meesalai.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For 
    a living she sold vegetables at the market. As was the normal practice farmers 
    borrowed money from her to tide over difficulties.&nbsp; Since she spoke fluent 
    Sinhalese her help was often sought to deal with the Army.&nbsp; She is said 
    to have received warnings from the LTTE.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Another circumstance in her life was that her 
    younger brother had been a member of the LTTE who fell into the hands of the 
    Army upon their moving into Thenmaratchy in April 1996.&nbsp; 3 months later 
    he was sent to his original home in Kegalle at his request.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>On the night in question about 7.30 PM, Saro was 
    with another brother and sister-in-law, talking outdoors in their compound 
    as it got dark.&nbsp; Three men knocked on the gate and called for Saro.&nbsp; 
    Saro got up to go saying that it was probably a farmer over a loan matter.&nbsp; 
    Not knowing who it was, the others went with Saro.&nbsp; The men asked who 
    is Saro.&nbsp; Saro declined to go nearer while the others drew back a little.&nbsp; 
    One of those who came circled and stole up to Saro from behind.&nbsp; He grabbed 
    the lady by the hair while she attempted to run and shot her dead.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>A notice was later put up by the LTTE in Manthuvil, 
    which claimed that Saro had betrayed their hiding places to the Army.&nbsp; 
    It added, &#147;Be warned that the same will happen to you, if you do such 
    things&#148;.</p>

    2</b><b><sup><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-size:6.5pt;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>nd</span></sup> October 
    1997:&nbsp; </b>Tharmalingam was a book seller and a news agent, and thus 
    well known in Jaffna.&nbsp; He also became SLFP organiser for Jaffna.&nbsp; 
    If any Southern party stood a chance of making electoral inroads into Jaffna, 
    it is the&nbsp; SLFP.&nbsp; Since the 1970s Jaffna&#146;s farmers have identified 
    the party as having policies friendly to their interests.&nbsp; Alfred Duraiyappah, 
    Jaffna Mayor, and its representative in Jaffna, was killed in 1975 by the 
    LTTE, which then had close links with the TULF hierarchy.&nbsp; The justificatory&nbsp; 
    use of&nbsp; Tamil nationalist ideology to kill political rivals has since 
    continued, greatly impoverishing politics in the North.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>If the only basis for the SLFP&#146;s appeal was 
    economical in the 70s, today it could be much more.&nbsp; This owes to the 
    fact that the SLFP leader Chandrika Kumaratunga has shown a capacity to transcend 
    the barrier of antagonistic ethno-nationalisms.&nbsp; A sizeable section of 
    the population, whose magnitude remains to be tested, also regard Chandrika 
    Kumaratunga as the greatest hope for peace, despite her unconvincing performance 
    in addressing&nbsp; several key violations during the conduct of the war.&nbsp; 
    However, if the SLFP leaders could campaign freely in Jaffna and in turn be 
    criticised by the local populace, it would mark one of the most exciting political 
    experiments in decades.&nbsp; This is the significance of the murder of Tharmalingam.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>According to local sources, when Tharmalingam 
    was murdered, the local army command first suspected the quasi militant groups 
    in Jaffna.&nbsp; Acting on a tip-off, it was the Police who uncovered the 
    plot.&nbsp; While the plot may be frighteningly elaborate, it also reveals 
    the difficulties faced by LTTE gun men in mobility around town.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>The assassins from the LTTE had got themselves 
    ferried in a fishing vessel to the coast of Colombogam , an eastern suburb 
    of Jaffna, by fishermen placed under duress.&nbsp; In the meantime electricity 
    to Tharmalingam&#146;s section of Colombogam had been switched off by an accomplice 
    in the electricity board.&nbsp; Someone had also got his dog out of the way.&nbsp; 
    The killers sneaked up to his house, where Tharmalingam was having dinner 
    by lamp light, fired about 5 shots at him through the window, and ran away 
    to escape by the same boat.&nbsp; The fishermen and the electricity board 
    accomplice were later&nbsp; taken into police custody.&nbsp; The missing dog 
    reappeared after 2 days.&nbsp; It is also part of the prevailing confused 
    thinking that such actions arising from political weakness are mistaken for 
    strength.</p>

    last motorcycle journey was an employee at his bakery with whom he was proceeding 
    to a place called Kalwayal.&nbsp; The family appears to believe that there 
    was little reason for the LTTE to stop them at that particular place unless 
    they had prior knowledge.&nbsp; Their conclusions seem to have been influenced 
    accordingly.&nbsp; They seem to think that misinformation had been fed to

  <p style='text-align:justify'><b>Krishnakumar (48):&nbsp; Killed in Pt Pedro: 
    18/01/96: </b>&nbsp;The killing by the LTTE of this dog lover and native of 
    Valvettithurai was documented in Special Report No. 9.&nbsp; An interesting 
    further development illustrates the ideological intolerance that prevents 
    even close relatives from looking at the matter objectively.&nbsp; A man who 
    had known Krishnakumar well met a close relative of the latter who was a former 
    Communist and an English teacher, who had also functioned as police inquirer 
    under the LTTE regime.&nbsp; He asked this relative, &#147;Why on Earth did 
    they kill this poor man?&nbsp; What harm could he have done to them?&#148;&nbsp; 
    Back came a steely reply from the relative, &#147;He was warned twice not 
    to talk to the Army.&#148;&nbsp; The man asked,&nbsp; &#147;What did Krishnakumar 
    say?&#148;&nbsp; It turns out that Krishnakumar&nbsp; had told the LTTE, &#147;What 
    have I got to talk with them, and what is it to you if I talk to them?&#148;</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Krishnakumar was of course long known to have 
    been openly critical of the LTTE.&nbsp; There is also little doubt that army 
    officers talking to him would have got some useful tips in dog breeding.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><b>Vaithilingam Srinivasan (48):&nbsp; Killed 
    in Manipay: 6/2/97: </b>&nbsp;This too was documented in Sp R 9.&nbsp; The 
    long list of charges against him by the LTTE would have classed him as the 
    Army&#146;s super spy.&nbsp; Further testimony suggests that he was nothing 
    of that kind.&nbsp; He was once a supporter of the LTTE.&nbsp; Since he knew 
    Sinhalese, people used him in dealing with the Army when a family member was 
    detained.&nbsp; According to local information, the main source of his trouble 
    with the LTTE was that he had declined to talk to the Army and get a member 
    of the LTTE out.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Srinivasan also played a creditable role in an 
    earlier incident reported by us in <a href="../bulletins/bul13.htm">Bulletin 
    No.13</a> which showed him to be a socially helpful person.&nbsp; On 02/11/96 
    a technician Ratnakumar was standing in front of Srinivasan&#146;s brother- 
    in- law&#146;s shop Sundar Sun, when he was injured by shrapnel from an RPG 
    fired by the LTTE at an army truck.&nbsp; Srinivasan immediately got the Army 
    to inform the sentry points on the way to Jaffna and arranged for the expeditious 
    conveyance of the wounded person to Jaffna Hospital.&nbsp; (The patient however 
    died 12 hours after being warded, while those close to the patient strongly 
    feel that he could easily have been saved.&nbsp; Those were times the hospital 
    was badly understaffed.)</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><b>Kandasamy Sasikumaran (16):&nbsp; Killed by 
    the Army in Puttur:&nbsp; 10/02/97:</b>&nbsp; The incident was reported in 
    Chapter 2 of&nbsp; Sp R 9. The boy was being taken for questioning by the 
    Army when two soldiers in the patrol were killed in an LTTE claymore&nbsp; 
    mine attack.&nbsp;&nbsp; The boy was seen alive after the mine attack, but 
    was later claimed to have been killed in the same attack.&nbsp; As far as 
    we are aware no investigation took place, although General Balagalle had been 
    to the area and apologised for the army misbehaviour in which several civilians 
    were injured or bruised.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><b>We add here a particular circumstance not reported 
    earlier.&nbsp; Sasikumaram, either dead or dying, was tied by a rope to a 
    vehicle and dragged along the road at least the 300 yards to Puttur junction.&nbsp; 
    This was witnessed by civilians, and it was a scene that gave particular offence.</b></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><b>Chelliah Padaiveerasingam:&nbsp; Killed in 
    Nunavil : 08/04/97 (Ch. 4 of SpR 9): </b>&nbsp;There is no doubt in the locality 
    or in the family that the gentleman, who spoke Sinhalese, was killed by the 
    LTTE.&nbsp; The LTTE neither acknowledged responsibility nor gave a reason 
    for the killing.&nbsp; There is a further reason that has added to the family&#146;s 
    bitterness.&nbsp; A daughter of the deceased is a serving member of the LTTE 
    since before the murder.&nbsp; The feeling in the family was that she, like 
    many others , had been tricked into joining.&nbsp; The daughter, a school 
    girl, had joined in the emotional hysteria the LTTE had drummed up in Thenmaratchy 
    during the 1995 Exodus from Valikamam.&nbsp; [See SpR6.]&nbsp; A son and another 
    daughter remain at home.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Consider the irony, one day the cornered girl&nbsp; 
    in the LTTE may die in a suicidal attack.&nbsp; Her picture would then appear 
    in glossy LTTE journals, and good Tamils in Western capitals would hold her 
    up as a martyr - in the cause of those who killed her own father without a 
    cause!&nbsp; Similar remarks would apply to several families featured in our 
    reports and a large number of LTTE cadre cornered in their impressionable 
    years into serving a cause they hardly understood.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><b>Mine attack on an escorted bus:&nbsp; Illavalai: 
    03/06/97 (Ch.5 of Sp R9):</b>&nbsp; The incident is less interesting for the 
    callousness it reveals on the part of the LTTE - nothing new there - than 
    for the manipulation and distortion of the social memory of it by others who 
    are prisoners of a past that impels them to live in untruth.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>We did not have the full details as SpR9 went 
    out.&nbsp; An escorted CTB bus, then having 15 passengers, travelling between 
    Illavalai and Mathagal at 2.00 PM, was attacked by a claymore mine fixed to 
    a tree with the explosion targeted at the front portion of the bus.&nbsp; 
    An escort is a facility provided in selected long distance buses, where accompanying 
    security personnel check passengers as they get in, thus obviating delays 
    at check points.&nbsp; In the explosion two civilians, the driver Elaiyathamby 
    Sivalingam (51) and a shop keeper Gunaratnam Suntharalingam (48) were killed, 
    in addition to an army officer, 2 soldiers and a policeman.&nbsp; 5 civilians 
    and some security personnel were badly injured.&nbsp; Of them a Roman Catholic 
    nun, a lady teacher and a man were taken to Palaly army hospital and two of 
    them were air lifted to the South for emergency treatment.&nbsp; The details 
    were correctly reported in the Uthayan which however understandably took cover 
    by quoting the Army as saying that it was an LTTE attack.&nbsp; No confusion 
    there where the readers are concerned.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>But about six weeks went by and sharp lines in 
    the memory of the incident were becoming blurred amidst the numerous cares 
    of life, when an oral campaign was doing its rounds in Jaffna&#146;s elite&nbsp; 
    society.&nbsp; The explosion it claimed was not from an LTTE mine, but rather 
    from an explosion of a device carried by one of the soldiers.&nbsp; Coming 
    from church dignitaries especially, the version had credibility, since Illavalai 
    is a Roman Catholic area.&nbsp; Among the articulate, the clergy, NGO leaders 
    and the town middle class, historical memory was undergoing metamorphosis.&nbsp; 
    It is this group who act as spokesmen for the community and influence opinion 
    outside.&nbsp; A key fact in the incident as reported and witnessed was being 
    left out.&nbsp; The head of the driver Sivalingam, was severed from the body 
    and blown off.&nbsp; This with other forensic factors pointed clearly to a 
    focused horizontal&nbsp; explosion very different from that of a grenade carried 
    by a soldier.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Now, why does this group feel impelled to distort 
    and misrepresent?&nbsp; Some of them are no doubt persons who courted&nbsp; 
    the LTTE for other reasons and got caught.&nbsp; Many others are nationalists 
    with narrow group loyalties who have a nebulous sympathy for &#145;their side&#146;.&nbsp; 
    Market driven career activism too encourages certain positions, however inimical 
    to the social interest.&nbsp; Whatever the cause, one is driven to defend 
    the indefensible and even to manipulate one&#146;s conscience accordingly.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>How is one to defend a cause that offers the people 
    only death, injury and destruction without any remedy?&nbsp; What kind of 
    liberation is it where people are time and again left injured by the actions 
    of their liberators, are forced to go to the so called genocidal&nbsp; enemy 
    for medical care to save their life, and also get shot as traitors for making 
    contact with them?&nbsp; This is indeed a very old story. The same point was 
    poignantly made in the Broken Palmyra[p.358-360] by Rajani Thiranagama&nbsp; 
    ten years ago.&nbsp; In times of such short memories, few seem to learn.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Defending this cause makes people stupid and inhuman 
    with creeping insanity.&nbsp; But such Tamils are everywhere in the country 
    and abroad, in peace groups, church circles and NGO fora, having a ready audience 
    in Colombo and abroad, among those who feel some compulsion to take them seriously.&nbsp; 
    Here are two examples of this influence:</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>The first is from the report of&nbsp; an election 
    monitoring group from the South that visited Jaffna prior to the local council 
    elections in January this year.&nbsp; It was revealed that the following message 
    had surfaced during a meeting at the Bishop&#146;s house with Christian clergy:&nbsp; 
    &#147;The view was very powerfully and eloquently put across that the election 
    was an imposed one which the people had not asked for.&nbsp; It was to prove 
    to the outside world that normalcy existed in Jaffna.&nbsp; It was to divide 
    Tamil society still further.&nbsp; The Sinhalese are hurting us by holding 
    these elections&#148;.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>After the elections the opinion makers were silent.&nbsp; 
    In writing about it in the Sunday Leader,&nbsp; Macan-Marker quoted a local 
    journalist summing up the outcome in a word as a &#145;Miracle&#146;!</p>

    to civilians and two were putting up posters.&nbsp; Two LTTE cadre in sarong, 
    the leader identified as Anandan, who was pointing an automatic, came forward 
    demanding roughly their identity cards, who they were and what they were doing.&nbsp; 
    Maruthu, a native of Batticaloa, edged near asking him to take it easy, quickly 
    caught the barrel of the gun and turned it up.&nbsp; About two shots went 
    up, and in the meantime Maruthu wrenched out the magazine with his other hand 
    and threw it&nbsp; away.&nbsp; Maruthu held Anandan in a vice-like grip with 
    his hands and mouth while Anandan shouted to his companion to throw the grenade.&nbsp; 
    In the meantime the other campaigners got into the car, held the door open 
    and asked Maruthu to rush inside.&nbsp; As Maruthu ran for the door, the grenade 
    was thrown.&nbsp; It exploded in a pile of rubbish causing Maruthu a minor 
    injury in the foot.&nbsp; The LTTEers too evidently ran away, since the magazine 
    was later found by an army patrol.&nbsp; Anandan was among the four killed

    1998, the LTTE attacked the EPDP camp at Pungudutivu, an offshore island, 
    killing upwards of 7 cadre and removing several weapons.&nbsp; The circumstances 
    of the attack remained a subject of speculation and the EPDP too played it 
    down by having the funerals in Kayts and hardly acknowledging it its main 
    office in Jaffna.&nbsp; A hint of what possibly went wrong came in the form 
    of an announcement by the LTTE in the Vanni on 4<sup><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:6.5pt;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>th</span></sup> March that it 
    was releasing 3 captured EPDP cadre to the ICRC on humanitarian grounds.&nbsp; 
    According to other sources, these 3, who were from outside Jaffna, had surrendered 
    with their weapons to the LTTE in Pungudutivu.&nbsp; A similar announcement 
    was made with regard to another two cadre on 23<sup><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-size:6.5pt;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>rd</span></sup><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'> March.</span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>It is generally known that the LTTE maintain a 
    small presence in Pungudutivu for smuggling purposes and hop across to the 
    Vanni mainland to the southeast whenever the army launches a search.&nbsp; 
    These cadre are usually within half a mile of the EPDP camp. By an understanding 
    reached either through direct contact or local channels, a stand off has generally 
    prevailed.&nbsp; The LTTE is adept at using&nbsp; such situations to its advantage 
    with no firm commitment.&nbsp; Confusion in the EPDP&#146;s politics also 
    works to the LTTE&#146;s advantage.&nbsp; It runs a paper, Thinamurasu, that 
    has for sometime been boosting the LTTE leader&#146;s image, and several of 
    its political activities have a populist flavour which point in the same direction.&nbsp; 
    On the other hand its cadre are largely unpoliticised military men feeling 
    the same pressures as those in any military organisation.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>While we cannot say how close the contact was 
    between the LTTE and the EPDP in Pungudutivu (such as may have simply arisen 
    through using the same wells or visiting the same houses), the LTTE had been 
    passing messages calling upon EPDP cadre to defect with their arms on the 
    promise of safe conduct to wherever they want to go.&nbsp; It is said that 
    such defections as above in the main had provided the LTTE with all the necessary 
    intelligence to attack the EPDP camp.&nbsp; The other open question is the 
    extent to which some of the other groups are being infiltrated by the LTTE 
    [see 6.7].&nbsp; The particular seaborne attack was apparently to deliver 
    a political message and to discredit any illusion in the public mind that 
    the EPDP had the blessings of the LTTE - a claim that PLOTE and TELO were 
    making for themselves in some areas.&nbsp; This action by the LTTE does not 
    however seem to have dented the EPDP&#146;s electoral performance.&nbsp; In 
    Pungudutivu the situation has returned to normal with the LTTE leader Thuyavan 
    holding court and summoning people from Jaffna by letter.</p>

mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>On 22</span><sup><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:
6.5pt;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>nd</span></sup> January EPRLF cadre went campaigning 
    in Kopay North.&nbsp; Their car fitted with a loudspeaker went into an interior 
    road in a north-westerly direction from Pt Pedro Road. Some way inside the 
    local folk advised them not to go further.&nbsp; The cadre turned the car 
    around, spoke through the loudspeaker and distributed notices.&nbsp; Four 
    LTTE members came on to the scene on bicycles, two in their teens in school 
    uniform and two in their early 20s dressed as farmers.&nbsp; They spoke roughly, 
    asked for the identity cards of the EPLRF cadre, trampled and threw their 
    leaflets and tried to damage their cassette player with a wire.&nbsp; They 
    then inserted their own cassette titled &#145;Leap Forward&#146; and asked 
    the driver to switch on the loud speaker and drive some way forward.&nbsp; 
    Meanwhile a crowd of civilians who had gathered argued with the LTTE to leave 
    the campaigners alone, since it would only bring trouble.&nbsp; The LTTE responded 
    in abuse unrecognisable to an ordinary Tamil speaker.&nbsp; They went away 
    after some time.&nbsp; Two of them are believed to have been killed in a confrontation 
    with the Army in Neervely after the elections on 6<sup><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-size:6.5pt;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>th</span></sup> February.&nbsp; 
    LTTE radio named the dead as Major Kumaran and Captain Ravanan.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Some of the considerations behind the LTTE&#146;s 
    handling of the elections appear more clearly in the following.&nbsp; An old 
    time Leftist gave his name as a candidate for one of the parties in Valikamam 
    East. Receiving intelligence of this the LTTE went to his home and told him 
    that they had received orders to kill him, but would not do so because it 
    would cause them a lot of trouble if they start this.&nbsp;&nbsp; They seemed 
    satisfied when they found he was not a candidate of the party that was expected 
    to do well, and left after advising him not to campaign hard and to go easy.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>In Valikamam, the LTTE seem to be maintaining 
    half a dozen or more cadre in each of the western and eastern sectors, replacing 
    them as casualties arise, which happens often.&nbsp; The purpose is to maintain 
    a token presence and carry out the occasional grenade or landmine attack , 
    staying in bunkers, several of which had been constructed earlier.&nbsp; Hardly 
    any of them are equipped&nbsp; for any kind of political work, let alone talk 
    to people.&nbsp; The numbers of course may change. <a href="#Top">[Top]</a></p>

  <h2><a name="_Toc514776202">6.4 &nbsp;&nbsp; The Islands:&nbsp; A creepy touch 
    of&nbsp; Vavuniya &amp; Mannar</a></h2>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>To some of the keener election monitors from the 
    South who visited Jaffna&#146;s offshore islands during the run up to the 
    local elections in January, there was in the air &nbsp;something distinctly 
    fishy - not unlike the feeling one gets in Vavuniya and Mannar.&nbsp; What 
    is common to the three zones is that quasi militant groups, also functioning 
    as political parties, are supposedly assisting the security forces in maintaining&nbsp; 
    security.&nbsp; What the people do in fact experience is less security, less 
    accountability and more rackets.&nbsp; In Mannar for example fishermen trying 
    to ply their trade honestly have almost given up owing to crippling restrictions 
    by the Navy.&nbsp; We have direct testimony that naval personnel have canvassed 
    fisherfolk not to waste time in their trade for meagre returns, but to join 
    in the lucrative racket of smuggling goods to the LTTE controlled mainland.&nbsp; 
    There is thus a game of happy families involving the security forces, the 
    Tamil militant groups, the traders and the fisherfolk acting as carriers.&nbsp; 
    Whether at the highest or at the lowest level, corruption is part of the war 
    games, and the people&nbsp; suffer all the more.&nbsp; The situation in Vavuniya 
    has of course received more press publicity.&nbsp; A recent development there 
    is that an honest SSP and a good investigator who was investigating corruption 
    at high levels was transferred by the IGP to work under an officer in Vavunniya 
    he had reportedly investigated and helped to charge-sheet.&nbsp; He had no 
    option but to hand in his retirement papers [see lead item in the Island of 
    19.2.98 on the transfer of SSP M.C. Nimal Fernando, Director SIU].&nbsp; </p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>The difference is that the PLOTE and TELO operate 
    in Mannar and Vavuniya.&nbsp; But the EPDP has jealousy guarded the islands 
    as their sole preserve given to them by President Premadasa in 1990.&nbsp; 
    Using the remnant population there as their vote bank and by effectively preventing 
    any other party from canvassing there in 1994, they bagged all the seats in 
    Jaffna District save one.&nbsp; Little wonder then that whatever Premadasa&#146;s 
    many sins, his picture adorns their Kayts office taking pride of place over 
    even the present incumbent.&nbsp; The EPDP had stepped into shoes spurned 
    by the LTTE after getting their share of the grand booty from Premadasa.&nbsp; 
    Whether the LTTE too hang a picture of Premadasa in their underground HQ in 
    the Vanni, one does not know.&nbsp; Now for the main story.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>A particular discovery the election monitors recorded 
    was that the Kayts Police refused to record any complaint against the EPDP 
    - a privilege even the ruling party in the country would not own up to elsewhere, 
    as abuses quickly become an issue.&nbsp; There was an incident involving the 
    EPDP and&nbsp; PLOTE in the islands when cadre from the latter went there 
    in the connection with the election campaign, and this was followed by a demand 
    to disarm the EPDP.&nbsp; The army brigadier at Kayts was asked to submit 
    a report.&nbsp; The report exonerated the EPDP in a less than credible manner.&nbsp; 
    Some naval personnel too complained to the monitors that the EPDP calls the 
    shots there, and that Delft Island is forbidden territory to them.&nbsp; There 
    is a definite stink around and the security forces may put it all on the political 
    patronage enjoyed by the EPDP in Colombo in return for its support to the 
    government in parliament.&nbsp; Is it merely as simple as that?&nbsp; Do they 
    all share a common vested interest in keeping any concessions to genuine democracy 
    out of the islands?&nbsp; The temporary police post at Delft did not serve 
    to eliminate a problem that has much wider implications - that being a safe 
    haven for the EPDP.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>It is said that there is no smoke without fire.&nbsp; 
    We can only point to the smoke.&nbsp;&nbsp; A letter to the editor of the 
    Uthayan (28.8.97) confirmed reports coming from a number of sources for a 
    long time.&nbsp; Beche de mer or sea slugs which have a lucrative export market 
    are found in abundance in the shallow waters off the islands. After spending&nbsp; 
    Rs.50/- on processing, a kilo of beche de mer (i.e 14 slugs) fetches Rs. 2300/- 
    on the market.&nbsp; Despite representations to the Navy which controls Nainativu 
    (island), permission has been refused for the local fisherman&#146;s co-operative 
    to process the slugs.&nbsp; According to the writer &#145;Nahathamby&#146;, 
    the co-op is not even allowed to market these.&nbsp; Instead the Navy has 
    ruled that the unprocessed slugs could be sold only to seven designated private 
    traders at effectively Rs 560/- per kilo.&nbsp; This means that after processing 
    there is a clear profit of Rs.1690/- per kilo.&nbsp; Thus the fisherfolk get 
    about 25% of what is their due.&nbsp; The writer points out that the restrictions 
    by the Navy have nothing to do with security and that the producers have to 
    endure poverty for the fear of consequences if they raise the matter openly.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>&#145;Nahamani&#146;&nbsp; finally poses an obvious 
    tongue in cheek question:&nbsp; &#147;The people of the islands have sent 
    nine members to parliament.&nbsp; Should not these MPs intervene at least 
    in this matter and grant justice to the people?&#148;</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Neither has the Navy contradicted these allegations, 
    nor the EPDP come forward to throw any light on the scandal.&nbsp; Not surprising 
    it seems.&nbsp; Well placed sources have repeated to us what is merely the 
    talk about town - that there is a share out in which similar monopoly arrangements 
    to the Navy&#146;s in Nainativu, are imposed by the Army in Mandativu and 
    Velanai, and by the EPDP in Kayts.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;
mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>That is why, while being guardedly optimistic about Jaffna, 
    one has to be wary about what could happen if democracy fails to revive to

  <p style='text-align:justify'>During the election campaign there were incidents 
    in Velanai and Delft involving the PLOTE and EPDP where of course things were 
    very much taped in favour of the latter.&nbsp; At 5.30 PM on this day an argument 
    flared up in front of the PLOTE office in First Cross Street leading to two 
    persons from the EPDP getting injured.&nbsp; PLOTE men were said to be armed 
    in addition with poles and knives while EPDP reinforcements started rushing 
    from Stanley road.&nbsp; The altercation renewed among the people the peculiar 
    fear they first experienced during the internecine clashes of 1986.&nbsp; 
    What may have become a full blown clash was brought to a close by the Army 
    intervening and firing warning shots into the air.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>The following day representatives from all Tamil 
    parties were summoned to Achchelu and the parties to the clash were given 
    a dressing down by Brigadier Shantha Kottegoda.&nbsp; He reminded them that&nbsp; 
    he had the authority to take back their weapons.&nbsp; The PLOTE and EPDP 
    were told that if they behaved like terrorists, they would have to be treated 
    as such,&nbsp; the EPDP that they had no authority to make arrests (- they 
    had arrested 3 PLOTE cadre), and the PLOTE that they had no business to assault 
    anyone.&nbsp; Anyone itching to fight , they were told, could go to Killinochchi 
    and fight, but not in Jaffna.&nbsp; Jaffna, he said, was no place for the 
    rackets in Vavuniya.&nbsp; They were asked to consider why the people prefer 
    the TULF, citing the TULF&#146;s surprising come back at the elections.&nbsp; 
    Their support, he told them, would have reduced significantly after the incidents

    This means that LTTE infiltrators had fired from the west of&nbsp; Jaffna

    examination is necessary.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Place these incidents against recent attacks on

    of the Air Force that was looking for a hijacked vessel.&nbsp; The same area 
    had been shelled by the Navy&nbsp; last year.&nbsp; Recently too (Ch.4 end) 
    we have seen atrocities by the Navy in the Army controlled area off Pt Pedro.&nbsp; 
    It is such actions throughout the North-East that mark the Sri Lankan Forces 
    ultimately as qualitatively unchanged - These are characteristically actions 
    against people who are viewed as aliens.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;
mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>Moreover today, a large section of coastal folk in the 
    Jaffna peninsula have been driven to abject poverty owing to crippling restrictions 
    on their trade for security reasons.</span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Let us take a closer look at some of the problems 
    that are diverse in their origins.&nbsp; Near Jaffna Town the problem is a 
    genuinely difficult one.&nbsp; The stretch of the coast near Jaffna Town facing 
    the Jaffna Lagoon is quite easily accessible from Kalmunai Point in the LTTE 
    controlled mainland.&nbsp; Ariyalai East is 2 miles northerly through shallow 
    water and Gurunagar (Jaffna) is 5 miles north westerly.&nbsp; The LTTE thus 
    make contact with fishermen coming out into the lagoon from the town area 
    and exert pressure on them to take them in.&nbsp; This was how the SLFP president 
    was assassinated on 2<sup><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:6.5pt;mso-ansi-language:
EN-GB'>nd</span></sup> October 1997.&nbsp; Also of note is the LTTE attack on 
    a Gurunagar army post on local election day - 29<sup><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:6.5pt;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>th</span></sup> January.&nbsp; 
    The Army&#146;s instinctive reaction is often to ban fishing - a move that 
    could barely last a few days in the face of protest and the economic implications 
    for those most affected.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>The Army has also found it very difficult to effect 
    counter-measures.&nbsp; For example, a system devised was for fisherman going 
    out to sea to drop their identity card into a box at the army point and collect 
    it on return.&nbsp; It has been suggested that a fisherman under duress could 
    easily drop a would-be-infiltrator&#146;s card into the box in addition to 
    his own in the morning.&nbsp; It is also difficult for these fishermen who 
    could be readily apprehended by the LTTE to be close to the Army.&nbsp; This 
    is the backdrop to the events in the Gurunagar area. &nbsp;The ugly scenes&nbsp; 
    which should have been avoided have, however, blown up the security problem 
    out of proportion to the reality.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>It would have been helpful if the problem had 
    been written about in the press more objectively.&nbsp; But what we see instead 
    are &#145;expert&#146; writings meant to confuse, crediting the LTTE with 
    awesome powers of penetration and superb striking ability.&nbsp; The truth 
    is not so creditable.&nbsp; If the Army stops the fishing, the LTTE would 
    be the first to strike up a humanitarian protest.&nbsp; No doubt its overseas 
    bulletins would be full of it.&nbsp; But it has absolutely no qualms about 
    using and re-using the fisherfolk - the victims - in the manner it does.&nbsp; 
    [On 23<sup><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-size:6.5pt;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>rd</span></sup> March, 
    after a long interval, two LTTE infiltrators, Capt.&nbsp; Thuvarakan and Lt. 
    Kunguli were killed in a confrontation in the Jaffna municipal area&nbsp; 
    - in Paasyoor.]</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>The case of fisherfolk in Vadamaratchy is different.&nbsp; 
    They face the sea lines from Trincomalee to KKS that are targeted by the Sea 
    Tigers.&nbsp; The Navy and Air Force, we understand, wanted fishing banned 
    totally.&nbsp; Representations were made by the fisherfolk to Bridadier Wijeratne 
    (524division, i.e Vadamaratchy) and Brigadier Chula Seneviratne (52 region, 
    i.e overall command of Thenmaratchy &amp; Vadamaratchy).&nbsp; These men who 
    dealt with civil affairs were sympathetic, knowing that there was no alternative 
    livelihood they could provide the fisherfolk with.&nbsp; We also understand 
    that discussions with the Navy &amp; Air Force were inconclusive, and the 
    Army took the initiative to allow fishing, but not too&nbsp; far from the 
    shore.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;
mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>No one is saying that the fishermen had anything to do 
    with the sinking of the two naval craft by suicide Sea Tigers on 22</span><sup><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-size:6.5pt;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>nd</span></sup> February.&nbsp; 
    All the defence correspondents who are ultimately briefed by sources in the 
    Navy have blamed the disaster on the breach of operational guidelines by splitting 
    the convoy.&nbsp; By blasting the hapless fisherfolk now, the Navy, which 
    is on the lookout for scapegoats, appears to be fighting a shadow war with 
    the Army who permitted the fishing.&nbsp; It would do them far more good to 
    cogitate a little and figure out who creates suicide Sea Tigers! It also reflects 
    an absence of overall government policy concerning security and rehabilitation, 
    together with some anarchy within the defence establishment.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>After the Exodus of October 1995 and prior to 
    the Army&#146;s entry into Thenmaratchy and Vadamaratchy in April 1996, the 
    LTTE&#146;s attempts to shift the entire population into the Vanni ran into 
    serious resistance. It was again a point of bankruptcy.&nbsp; The people by 
    then clearly understood that the result would be a humanitarian catastrophe.&nbsp; 
    Several well authenticated reports&nbsp; have testified that it was at this 
    point that the LTTE used overt and covert appeals to&nbsp; coastal folk.</p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText>A large number of coastal folk, including a high proportion 
    of Gurunagar, went to the Vanni and trickled back over the last two years, 
    severely disillusioned.&nbsp; Sadly, having returned, they are once more constrained 
    to live in disillusionment.&nbsp; Such has been the utter inadequacy of government 
    policy.&nbsp; This country has suffered enough from group divisions.&nbsp; 
    Creating even by default conditions where the mantle of victimhood is cast 
    over a particular community or sub-community should be avoided.&nbsp; That 
    is why present trends in handling the coastal folk are dangerous. <a href="#Top">[Top]</a></p>
  <h2><a name="_Toc514776205">6.7 The LTTE&#146;s Future Options in Jaffna:&nbsp; 
    A Reading of&nbsp; of Current Trends</a></h2>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>We focus here on developments alluded to in the 
    course of this report that we need to keep in mind while carrying forward 
    the rebuilding of civil society.&nbsp; The indications are that the LTTE is 
    finding direct infiltration too costly.&nbsp; Throughout its history though, 
    it has demonstrated an ingenuity for using the very freedoms and protection 
    afforded by civil society to pervert them from within and to enforce its totalitarian 
    agenda.&nbsp; One favourable development was that the LTTE drew back from 
    attacking candidates and disrupting recent elections.&nbsp; It has also in 
    recent times toned down in its propaganda references to the other groups or 
    Tamil parties as &#145;traitors&#146;, without giving away anything in its 
    absolutist claims.&nbsp; Its leaflets still have much in the vein of every 
    grain of sand in Jaffna bearing testimony to the heroic sacrifices of its 
    martyrs;&nbsp; the pain and grief with which they had to quit Jaffna was but 
    only a shrewd tactical decision on the part of their inscrutably wise leader, 
    in pursuance of their guerrilla war against Sinhalese forces;&nbsp; and that 
    they will make a glorious return to the cheers and jubilation of the people. 
  </p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;
mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>Further, without making any firm commitment, the LTTE 
    has been sending diffuse messages through returnees from the Vanni to the 
    effect that it will not attack the other groups in Jaffna, but will only attack 
    the Army for the purpose of restarting peace talks.</span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>In our <a href="../bulletins/bul14.htm">Bulletin 
    No.14</a> on the Vanni issued in November last year, we reported that a significant 
    number of LTTE cadre from Jaffna were disillusioned and wanted to leave the 
    organisation.&nbsp; We now know that a number of them (several hundreds) have 
    written to their parents in Jaffna saying that they had left the organisation 
    and wanted them to come to the Vanni and escort them home.&nbsp; Many are 
    no doubt genuine and civil society must stand up for their rights irrespective 
    of individual intentions.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>We have also given an instance in this report 
    where two youths killed after a claymore mine attack were in possession of 
    Army residence permits.&nbsp; Other instances too, of a similar nature have 
    been reported.&nbsp; All these are indications of things that&nbsp; we must 
    be prepared for, even if the worst fails to materialise.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>The challenge before civil society is to take 
    steps to strengthen itself against attempts to pervert it while there is opportunity, 
    however small.&nbsp; This would mean for example taking up a public position 
    against claymore mine and grenade attacks that are directly or indirectly 
    meant to harm society.&nbsp; To dodge such responsibility and simply ask the 
    Government to talk to the LTTE, is a sign of fatal weakness. <a href="#Top">[Top]</a></p>

mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>Gamini Navaratne who was editor of the Saturday Review 
    from April 1984 until the paper ceased to function in October 1987 in the 
    wake of the Indian Army offensive, passed away peacefully in Colombo on 10</span><sup><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-size:6.5pt;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>th</span></sup><span
lang=EN-GB> </span>March 1998.&nbsp; Known unambiguously as Gamini in Jaffna - 
    being the only Sinhalese admitted to be resident there - he was a particular 
    source of strength to its residents from January 1986 to May 1987 when regular 
    shelling by the Army at Jaffna Fort, together with aerial bombing became a 
    new source of terror.&nbsp; The Saturday Review office, a mere _ mile from 
    the Fort, stood its ground in an area that was steadily becoming a ghost town.&nbsp; 
    A morale boosting measure adopted by the paper during this period was to publish 
    &#145;Bomber Supplements&#146;. &nbsp;During aerial attacks the staff went 
    into a bunker, recorded the radio conversations of the pilots overhead, and 
    published a verbatim record.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>The prominent niche which Gamini occupies in history 
    is to have given the Tamil people of this country a voice when all else was 
    dark following the holocaust of July 1983.&nbsp; As though frightened by what 
    they had unleashed, the ruling interests were being haunted by wraiths of 
    Tamil, Indian and internal conspiracies staring at them everywhere.&nbsp; 
    It was a suffocating atmosphere where the major section of the press in Colombo 
    almost voluntarily functioned as departments of the Ministry for National 
    Security.&nbsp; Local reporting of regular&nbsp; atrocities by the armed forces 
    against Tamil civilians was suppressed to such an extent, that the South was 
    overcome by shock in July 1987 when it discovered that Sri Lanka was bereft 
    of friends.&nbsp; This was when India imposed its solution.&nbsp; Subsequent 
    events have failed to correct the bias that has unconsciously imposed itself 
    on nearly all dispatches from this country by prestigious agencies.&nbsp; 
    For example, many of these end with, &#145;Tiger rebels, are fighting for 
    a separate state for the Tamils of Sri Lanka&#146;.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Gamini stood head and shoulders above this debilitating 
    play of turbulent emotions. &nbsp;A key role in the founding of the Saturday 
    review in May 1982 was played by K. Kanthasamy, a successful company lawyer 
    who had dedicated himself to human rights and the rehabilitation of Tamils 
    in the aftermath of the 1977 communal violence.&nbsp; Gamini, a close friend 
    of S.Sivanayagam, the founding editor, from their Times of Ceylon days, was 
    associated with the Review from its inception, and contributed a column.&nbsp; 
    As a lobby correspondent he had come to know the country&#146;s leading political&nbsp; 
    figures closely, including President J.R. Jayewardene.&nbsp; Sivanayagam, 
    described as &#145;one of the most under-rated English writers among journalists 
    in Sri Lanka&#146; by Ajith Samaranayake, was in his element as the editor 
    of the English weekly from Jaffna.&nbsp; It was made plain from the beginning 
    that the paper was meant to fill a vacuum arising from the fact that in reporting 
    , opinion and analysis, the Tamil perspective was either neglected or suppressed 
    in the Colombo press.&nbsp; The paper also came to provide a forum for dissident 
    Southern opinion - among its notable occasional contributors were Ian Goonetilleke, 
    doyen of Sri Lankan librarians, H.N.Fernando of the Ceylon Teachers&#146; 
    Union and Dayan Jayatilleke.&nbsp; Many Jaffna men came to treat it as their 
    own paper, in a manner no other paper in the country could boast of.&nbsp; 
    People would gather at its office at 4.00 PM on Friday for their copy, as 
    the first copies were brought in from St Joseph&#146;s Catholic Press by Anton, 
    the office assistant.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>From the end of 1982 the situation got progressively 
    worse. Gandhiyam, in the funding of which Kandasamy was involved through the 
    Tamil Refugees Rehabilitation Organisation (TRRO), was sealed, and its president, 
    Dr. Rajasundaram, and secretary, A. David, were detained under the PTA.&nbsp; 
    On advice given Kandasamy left the country for England in June 1983.&nbsp; 
    The events in the run up to and following the rigged referendum of December 
    1982 to extend the life of parliament, portended something malevolent in the 
    air.&nbsp; In June a passenger bus had been attacked in the Trincomalee area 
    killing over a dozen Tamil civilians.&nbsp; Goons of the ruling party had 
    demonstrated outside the home of Chief Justice Percy Colin Thome&#146; and 
    other judges while the police looked the other way.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;
mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>On 2</span><sup><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:
6.5pt;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>nd</span></sup> July 1983 the Saturday Review was 
    sealed by the security forces, just three weeks before the holocaust.&nbsp; 
    Later Sivanayagam, who was asked to report for questioning by the CID, left 
    Jaffna by boat for the Indian shore.&nbsp; By this time India&#146;s involvement 
    in the question was very deep.&nbsp; (Senator) S.Natesan led the successful 
    fight in court for the unsealing of the Saturday Review.&nbsp; In April 1984 
    it fell to Gamini to edit the paper until a suitable replacement could be 
    found, as Gamini was heavily committed with his news agency work in Colombo.&nbsp; 
    As the expected replacement did not arrive, Gamini stayed on, travelling between 
    Colombo and Jaffna - a journey that became increasingly more tedious.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>As an editor Gamini maintained the highest journalistic 
    traditions.&nbsp; He kept out nothing on the grounds that he disagreed with 
    it, but on the other hand he encouraged people to write on controversial and 
    sensitive matters.&nbsp; He ran&nbsp; a paper that was balanced as was possible 
    under the circumstances.&nbsp; This became more difficult after the LTTE began 
    decimating the other groups from May 1986.&nbsp; But it never resorted to 
    overt censorship of the Saturday Review.&nbsp; The vacuum that existed in 
    Jaffna pushed Gamini into roles outside the bounds of journalism.&nbsp; He 
    got involved in starting the Mothers&#146; front in 1985, and then a citizen&#146;s 
    group to make representations to the government.&nbsp; At one point Gamini 
    saw his task as &#145;getting Prabakaran and Jayewardene to shake hands.&#146;&nbsp; 
    When the Kittu - Raheem duo were powerful in Jaffna he was kept in hope that 
    there was a peace making role for him.&nbsp; Once the LTTE leader took direct 
    control of Jaffna in January&nbsp; 1987 after a definite rejection of the 
    December 19<sup><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:6.5pt;mso-ansi-language:
EN-GB'>th</span></sup> proposals, there was a clear signal for Gamini to keep 
    out of peace making.&nbsp; </p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Gamini also saw a role for the paper as providing 
    source material for human rights documentation.&nbsp; In retrospect this served 
    a valuable purpose.&nbsp; Lists of victims on a yearly basis from the Home 
    for Human Rights were supplied by Kugamoothy.&nbsp; Gamini saw in these an 
    effective counter to government propaganda.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>The Saturday Review was itself a microcosm which 
    shaped or influenced the destiny of the community, as well as of individuals 
    during its active life spanning the five most important years in the 80s that 
    decided the direction - a fatal one - of the Tamil struggle.&nbsp; For us 
    it is not entirely a co-incidence that the writing of the Broken Palmyra commenced 
    with the effective closure of the Saturday Review in October 1987.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>As the reader may have already suspected, Gamini 
    was a maverick.&nbsp; It took someone with a penchant for adventure and the 
    unorthodox to play the kind of role he did.&nbsp; Working with him was not 
    always easy.&nbsp; It on occasions proved difficult to draw the line between 
    the authority of the editor and what more properly belonged to the jurisdiction 
    of the council of management.&nbsp; But this has no relevance to Gamini&#146;s 
    historical role.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;
mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>There is the question why the government sealed the Saturday 
    Review on 2</span><sup><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:6.5pt;
mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>nd</span></sup> July 1983.&nbsp; The more immediate cause 
    appears to have had to do with the Tamil Eelam Liberation Front (TELF).&nbsp; 
    The party was a break away group of the TULF led by an old Federal Party stalwart 
    and septuagenarian, Dr. Tharmalingam.&nbsp; It took a separatist line, accusing 
    the TULF leadership of having betrayed the 1977 election mandate for separatism 
    in accepting District Development Councils.&nbsp; On the other hand it was 
    well known that the real push behind the TELF was S.J.V. Chelvanayakam&#146;s 
    son S.C. Chandrahasan, who himself remained on the TULF politburo.&nbsp; A 
    clear manifestation of this was that the TELF line was being advanced by the 
    &#145;Suthanthiran&#146; which was owned by the Chelvanayakam family.&nbsp; 
    This was the time at which the government had failed to make the DDCs work, 
    rendering them patently effete, having no substance as the promised devolution 
    exercise.&nbsp; The Saturday Review in reflecting the general public disenchantment 
    with the TULF came also to be seen as promoting the TELF.&nbsp; A parallel 
    feeling growing among the middle class was that only &#145;the boys&#146; 
    could deliver the goods.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Putting the two together the Police, and no doubt 
    many others, drew the conclusion that the TELF was a front organisation with 
    the militants behind it.&nbsp; Chandrahasan too contributed to this conclusion.&nbsp; 
    When Prabakaran and Uma Mahewaran were detained by the Tamil Nadu Police after 
    their Pondi Bazaar clash in May 1982, Chandrahasan flew to India and appealed 
    to the Indian authorities against their deportation to Sri Lanka.&nbsp; To 
    the middle classes, especially the expatriate professionals, it seemed only 
    natural that the &#145;boys&#146; would welcome patrons among them to finance, 
    counsel and guide them.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>The truth was that if Prabakaran and Uma Maheswaran 
    had graduated from the patronage of the TULF, they no longer needed patrons 
    as mentors or guides, but only for finance.&nbsp; There is nothing to indicate 
    that they sought a patron in Chandrahasan.&nbsp; Many expatriates who trooped 
    into Madras during the coming years with Eelam constitutions, flags and national 
    anthems discovered it the hard way.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>The Sri Lankan Police no doubt viewed the TELF 
    as larger than life.&nbsp; It is also significant that the Suthanthiran&nbsp; 
    was sealed at the same time as the Saturday Review.&nbsp; Following the onset 
    of the July 1993 holocaust, Chandrahasan and his family narrowly escaped the 
    wrath of the security forces and goons in Colombo and reached India.&nbsp; 
    Dr.&nbsp; Tharmalingam left Jaffna to live with one of his children abroad.&nbsp; 
    His house was taken by militant group and was bombed by the Air Force, inevitably 
    along with some neighbouring houses.&nbsp; The TELF was hardly spoken of again.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;

    to be clearer about the holocaust of 23</span><sup><span lang=EN-GB

    was already by June a great deal of violence against Tamils in the Trincomalee 
    District.&nbsp; In Jaffna the Army had on orders torched several houses near 
    Kantharmadam after a soldier at an election booth was killed during the local 
    elections of March.&nbsp; There had also been the shooting of civilians.&nbsp; 
    But as to the holocaust itself, a number of indications suggest that Jayewardene 
    was not in control of events.&nbsp; There was within the UNP a bitter struggle 
    for succession with different ministers having their own agenda and doing 
    their own thing.&nbsp; There is little evidence of a master plan.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;
mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>One might say that having systematically dismantled the 
    restraints imposed by law, and then the possibility of democratic change by 
    the rigged referendum of December 1982, the ruling party itself became subject 
    to unrestrained intrigue - leading to violence and murder, eventually within 
    the UNP itself.</span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>There is also no doubt that if the paper had not 
    been sealed on&nbsp; 2<sup><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:6.5pt;mso-ansi-language:
EN-GB'>nd</span></sup> July, it would have been under intense pressure once the 
    holocaust got under way.&nbsp; In massacres around Jaffna, the Army killed 
    about 53 persons.&nbsp; The government had imposed heavy censorship.&nbsp; 
    Sivanayagam was a bold editor and would not have taken things lying down.&nbsp; 
    Some of his earlier editorials accusing Southern papers of &#145;Pen &amp; 
    Dagger Journalism&#146; for distorting and misreporting repressive actions 
    of the state&nbsp; in the North stay clearly etched in the minds of the readers.&nbsp; 
    He would have been very closely watched by a state wielding arbitrary powers. 
  </p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Sivanayayagam did not expect his own life to be 
    caught up in so much intrigue and uncertainty.&nbsp; He held a simple belief, 
    common at that time, that he would soon return to a liberated home.&nbsp; 
    He was in India close to Chandrahasan and did some writing for Kanthasamy.&nbsp; 
    His life in time became a tragedy.&nbsp; He was never again the master of 
    his trade, the master of his own house, which he was at the editor&#146;s 
    desk in Jaffna.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;
mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>During the early days of the IPKF deployment in Jaffna 
    after the 29</span><sup><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:6.5pt;mso-ansi-language:
EN-GB'>th</span></sup> July 1987, Sivanayagam suddenly appeared at his home in 
    Nallur.&nbsp; He told a friend that a Captain Williams of the&nbsp; RAW had 
    called him and asked him if he would like a ride to Jaffna, and here he was.&nbsp; 
    The friend was thoroughly taken aback.&nbsp; Without understanding the intricacies 
    of the local situation, Sivanayagam had thought it a simple return to his 
    his old turf.&nbsp; There had been too many intrigues, too much internal blood-letting 
    and much water had flowed under the bridge.&nbsp; The LTTE soon contacted 
    him and asked him to get back within a short time.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>In the two months that remained before the LTTE 
    resumed hostilities, Gamini&#146;s writings clearly expressed some displeasure 
    with the Indian presence.&nbsp; Two RAW officers, including one colonel, paid 
    the Saturday Review editorial desk a &#145;courtesy call&#146;. Gamini was 
    then in Colombo.&nbsp; After the Indian Army&#146;s retaking of Jaffna, some 
    of the Tamil papers resumed publication in early 1988.&nbsp; The question 
    of restarting the Saturday Review did not arise immediately.&nbsp; To begin 
    with there was no ready editor at hand.&nbsp; Kanthasamy came to Jaffna in 
    June 1988 with plans for rehabilitation.&nbsp; In July he disappeared after 
    being kidnapped by the EROS.&nbsp; It has been pointed out that he escaped 
    the Welikade prison massacre of July 1983, which claimed his friend Dr. Rajasundsram, 
    by leaving the country a month earlier, only to be killed by an unruly Tamil 
    group five years later.&nbsp; With Kanthasamy died any plans he had for the 
    future of the Saturday Review.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>We have mentioned Kugamoorthy who was both closely 
    associated with the Saturday Review and with human rights work in Jaffna.&nbsp; 
    He was also an employee of the SLBC.&nbsp; He was no supporter of the LTTE, 
    but knew Mahattaya through circumstances having nothing to do with militant 
    activities.&nbsp; During 1987 he had on request helped journalists to contact 
    Mahattaya, as he readily responded to requests for help by others in need.&nbsp; 
    The previous year he had also helped EPRLF cadre fleeing from the LTTE.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>During early September 1990 he was picked up at 
    a human rights conference by the Mt Lavinia Police and was released after 
    the intervention of other delegates.&nbsp; Later that month he was picked 
    up by official goons soon after leaving his work place, while travelling on 
    a motor cycle down Jawatte Road.&nbsp; All inquiries about him were of no 
    avail.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>No story of the Saturday Review would be complete 
    without the mention of A.J. Canagaratna, a self effacing man who provided 
    continuity between the two editors.&nbsp; Under Gamini much of the day to 
    day running of the paper, as well as editorial decisions, fell to him.&nbsp; 
    He had a distinguished career as a journalist with ANCL, then as editor of 
    Jaffna&#146;s, &#145;The Co-operator&#146; in the 70s, and later in the English 
    Teaching Unit of the University of Jaffna.&nbsp; He is one survivor now almost 
    miraculously in robust health, no little thanks to the ministrations of Kugamoorthy.&nbsp; 
    A keen and perceptive observer of Jaffna&#146;s post independence politics 
    with a widely enriched mind1, he, if anyone, has a most interesting book to 
    write.</p>

    hospital on 3</span><sup><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-size:6.5pt;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>rd</span></sup> April 
    1998 at the age of 72.&nbsp; As a relentless campaigner for minority and human 
    rights for 20 years, since his retirement from the Civil Service, his loss 
    will be greatly felt by the Muslims and Tamils in particular.&nbsp; In this 
    area, two organisations&nbsp; with whom he had been closely associated are 
    the Movement for Inter-Racial Justice and Equality (MIRJE) and the Civil Rights 
    Movement (CRM). In the CRM he had worked closely with the late Bishop Lakshman 
    Wickremasinghe, K.Kanthasamy and (Senator) S.Natesan.&nbsp; Both these groups 
    focused critical attention on the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) at the 
    time it was passed in 1979, and the MIRJE which was formed then came into 
    prominence in Jaffna after its mission produced a report on how the PTA was 
    being put into operation.&nbsp; These initiatives helped to bring international 
    attention to the urgency of addressing the Tamil problem, leading in turn 
    to missions such as that of the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) 
    in 1981.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Charlie has consistently and unrelentingly campaigned 
    for a solution to the ethnic problem on federal lines.&nbsp; His scholarly 
    stature and personal charm comprising friendliness with simplicity, kept him 
    above sectarianism and thus helped to hold several activist groups together 
    on common causes.&nbsp; Many of them sought his presence on their committees.&nbsp; 
    At the time of death he had been president of the MIRJE for several years.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>If one had reasons for feeling annoyed with Charlie, 
    one later relented with a smile.&nbsp; Such instances owed none other than 
    to the fact that far too many demands were being made of persons like Charlie 
    who were too few in number, and Charlie was seldom the man to say &#145;no&#146;.&nbsp; 
    Inspite of this constraint, Charlie&#146;s attainments in aid of his causes 
    have been prolific.&nbsp; This he achieved by being a quiet presence encouraging, 
    organising and giving moral support to individuals, even where he lacked the 
    energy to throw himself completely into the specific work.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>To be clear, we examine some of his legacy, apart 
    from what has been mentioned.&nbsp; He was the founder of the Social Scientists&nbsp; 
    Association which in the early 80s brought out a pioneering collection of 
    papers in the volume titled &#145;Ethnicity and Social Change in Sri Lanka&#146; 
    which made a significant contribution to debunking chauvinist readings of 
    history that were at the root of state ideology. The SSA also provided refreshing 
    perspectives on how the building of a plural nation and of working class solidarity 
    had been subverted by a ruling class whose outlook was essentially feudalistic.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>The years following the holocaust of July 1983 
    were very difficult years even in the South.&nbsp; Raising sane opinion on 
    the Tamil question proved extremely difficult. An important work by Charlie&#146;s 
    circle, &#145;Sri Lanka:&nbsp; The Ethinic Conflict - Myths, Realities and 
    Perspectives&#146; by the Committee for Rational Development, addressing some 
    heart-searching&nbsp; issues arising from July 1983, was published by Navrang, 
    New Delhi, in 1984.&nbsp; When the JVP insurgency broke out in 1987, MIRJE 
    was among those organisations threatened by the JVP for supporting the devolution 
    proposals under the Indo-Lanka Accord.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>In a move to promote fresh thinking in the South 
    on the national question, Charlie was instrumental in&nbsp; MIRJE launchig 
    the Sinhalese journal &#145; the Yukthiya&#146; in the late 80s.&nbsp; Its 
    sales then were about 2000.&nbsp; Its momentous growth could not have come 
    about without the diversity of causes supported by Charlie.&nbsp; A grave 
    crisis of press freedom came about with attempts to impeach President Premadasa 
    in 1991.&nbsp; During this period the sales of &#145;Yukthiya&#146; and of 
    &#145;Ravaya&#146; - the latter edited by Victor Ivan - picked up for sometime 
    to levels above 60 000-putting them in the mainline&nbsp; league.&nbsp; The 
    two together made a tremendous impact on voter thinking&nbsp; on the ethnic 
    question that helped the People&#146;s Alliance government to come to power 
    on a platform of peace with radical devolution.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>These are some examples of Charlie&#146;s legacy 
    and very important ones too.&nbsp; Where we are concerned , Charlie has been 
    consistently supportive and strongly felt that ours was work that needed doing.&nbsp; 
    When we organised the commemoration for Rajani Thiranagama in November 1989 
    at the University of Jaffna, he showed his solidarity at a critical time by 
    leading a MIRJE delegation to take part in the proceedings.&nbsp; The historical 
    importance of&nbsp; what he has left behind would be much greater than what 
    appears now on the surface.<a href="#Top">[Top]</a></p>
