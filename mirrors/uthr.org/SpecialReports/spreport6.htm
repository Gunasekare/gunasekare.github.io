  </span></h3>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:
12.0pt;'><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">When the government 
  forces launched their drive towards Jaffna at the beginning of October, the 
  people were once more caught between the callousness of the Government and the 
  LTTE to whom the civilians mattered little. The Government, while using the 
  rhetoric of &quot;liberating the Tamils from the clutches of the LTTE&quot;, 
  had little tangible conception of the welfare of the Tamil people. It had supposedly 
  air-dropped leaflets which never reached them, asking people to seek shelter 
  in schools and places of worship. People were also advised to keep away from 
  the LTTE. All this was too vague. By the seemingly random manner in which the 
  government forces were bombing and shelling, these instructions made no practical 
  sense to the people. At times even schools and places of worship were hit. 
  Against the backdrop of heavy shelling and aerial bombing, most of the people 
  decided not to take a risk and sought refuge mostly around Jaffna town. In their 
  experience, there was nothing `liberating' in the Government's actions.</font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:
12.0pt;'><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">On the otther hand, 
  the LTTE, apart from making the claim that it would fight to the last man to 
  prevent Jaffna from falling, took no responsibility for the civilian population 
  that it claimed to represent. An observation about recent LTTE practice is that 
  they did not, unlike in the mid-80s, use their own cadre as sentries to monitor 
  enemy movements. In the past these young sentries used to be the first casualties 
  in any offensive action. Then several militant groups operated in competition. 
  The posting of sentries in those days also served the public relations function 
  of giving the civilians a picture that they were living behind a border under 
  the protection of the militants. This early warning role in recent times has 
  been played, instead, by civilians who were not conscious of their role. In 
  the event of firing noises now, LTTE forces rushing into an area would ask civilians 
  for information on enemy movements. Once the army had significantly expanded 
  its perimeter in Jaffna and used mobile limited operations, it had become a 
  war without borders in which the civilians had this new role.</font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:
12.0pt;'><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.1pt;'>Certain aaspects of the LTTE's thinking had however begun to surface since 
  the government forces' abortive military operation this July. Heavy shelling 
  had caused the majority of the population to flee. But those who had remained 
  behind found government troops far better behaved than what the previous phases 
  of the war and LTTE propaganda had led them to expect. The troops had withdrawn 
  by 19th July and word got around that army behaviour had been friendly or at 
  least tolerable. This was evidently annoying to the LTTE. A number of those 
  who had remained behind had been questioned or otherwise harassed by the LTTE 
  allegedly under suspicion of being informers to the government forces.</span></font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:
12.0pt;'><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">The LTTE thought 
  it had successfully moulded the people for six years and more to view them as 
  liberators and be slavishly obedient to them. The notion that they could live 
  under government control and manage their affairs struck at the roots of the 
  LTTE's ideological edifice. This time, in October, the LTTE encouraged and even 
  forced the civilians to vacate as the government troops advanced. Apart from 
  the heavy bombing and shelling, also in the minds of the people was the Indian 
  Army's advance in October 1987, exactly 8 years earlier. Many people had then 
  remained behind in their areas. The LTTE then, as happened again in 1990, provoked 
  the army from near places of civilian refuge and ran away. The worst incident 
  of this kind at that time was in Jaffna Hospital. </font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:
12.0pt;'><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.1pt;'>The foreggoing incident featured prominently in recent discussions among 
  Jaffna Hospital doctors on the decisions they had to take concerning the hospital. 
  Just about 4 members of the LTTE had been in the hospital in 1987 when the Indian 
  army column came near. Having thrown one grenade and fired shots which claimed 
  several casualties, the four had run through the hospital and escaped. About 
  70 patients and medical staff died during the subsequent Indian army action. 
  (Many civilians died from indiscriminate action by the Indian Army causing a 
  total civilian death toll of 800 - 1500 for the entire operation of taking Jaffna 
  in 1987.)</span></font></p>

  [The civilian death toll for November, to give rough estimates, would be about 
  30 from bombing and shelling and 300, very conservatively, from causes directly 
  related to the forced exodus resulting in disease and debility. Most deaths

  air force bombing claimed the lives of 10 refugees from Urumpirai camping at 
  the edge of Jaffna's city limits in Ariyalai East. On the 28th began the decisive 
  battle for Neervely, 6 miles up the Pt. Pedro Road from Jaffna. The battle was 
  intense because, according to civilians, an LTTE counter-attack happened to 
  have coincided with the army advance. Shelling by the army on the 29th morning 
  fell at the edge of Jaffna's northern city limits. On that day about 42 civilians 
  died because of aerial bombing in civilian areas outside town, far from the 
  combat zone. A further 4 died because of shelling. Two shells fell in Gurunagar, 
  inside city limits and facing the lagoon to the south. Although people were 
  terrified by the noise, the city remained fairly safe.</font></p>

  brought Puttur under control. The LTTE launched a counter-thrust similar to 
  that of 14th July 1995 in Allaveddy. This time's counter offensive by the LTTE 
  ended in catastrophe with the latter losing more than 150 seasoned cadre. From 
  what emerged from top ranking LTTE leaders, they had accepted the likelihood 
  of losing Jaffna. A decision had been taken that if the army persisted in its 
  advance the LTTE would vacate and revert to guerilla warfare centred about the 
  Vanni (Wanni) jungles. Yet for civilian consumption the rhetoric of fighting 
  the 'final battle' and pushing the army out of Jaffna was kept up!</span></font></p>

lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.1pt;'>We may reemark at this point some reasons for the army's calling off the 
  July advance. A common belief in the South attributes as the main reason the 
  LTTE's thrust on 14'th July which resulted in 50-100 army casualties. This did 
  perhaps give the army the feeling that it had moved too far too fast. But based 
  on information available to knowledgeable persons in Jaffna, the LTTE itself 
  did not consider the 14'th July thrust resulting in about 60 LTTE casualties 
  a success. The army appears to have devised a drill by which an intruding party 
  is trapped. LTTE sources consider this to have happened on 14'th July. They 
  also believed that the army had been unaware of having trapped the intruders 
  due to a breakdown in communication at the centre, allowing most of the intruders 
  to escape. The LTTE was not so lucky in October when they tried the same thing 
  at Punnalai Kadduwan and lost about 150 fighters.</span></font></p>

lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:

  off the July operation was the civilians' fleeing (mostly because of heavy shelling) 
  the area where the Government hoped to set up its civil administration. The 
  way LTTE analysts read the Government's plans for the October advance following 
  the initial moves, was that on reaching Kopay, the army would change course, 
  move Kaithady and then bring Chemmani (Navatkuli) bridge under their control. 
  There was also speculation that another party would come from Pooneryn by sea 
  and both together would block the Chemmani and railway bridges. This would have 
  prevented the civilian population from moving out of Valikamam.</span></font></p>

  of civilians far worse. There seemed to be no unity between the Government and 
  the army, or within the army itself, on whether they wanted the civilians to 
  stay or go. The Government for its part talked of restoring civil administration 
  and accelerating reconstruction, but gave no clear instructions to the people. 
  As barbaric (and barbarous) a means of communication as it was, when the army 
  shelled certain areas, the people took it as a message to go. The army was happier 
  when the civilians left as it made their work easier. When civilians inadvertently 
  got 'caught' to the army, they were encouraged to flee.</span></font></p>

  western sector of Jaffna peninsula including the city, separated from the rest 
  of the peninsula, i.e. Thenmaratchi and Vadamaratchi, by two lagoons) had moved 
  into Jaffna and other centres (Jaffna University, Jaffna College in Vaddukoddai 
  and Uduvil Girls' School, among others). The refugees felt that by using available 
  institutional connections and international NGOs to communicate with the authorities 
  in Colombo, their security could be adequately looked after. They were determined 
  to stay put and move into their homes once the army took control. In all, together 
  with the population in Jaffna and suburbs,about 350,000 people were involved.</span></font></p>

  for a particular action of the LTTE's. In terms of its totalitarian aims, it 
  has acquired an instinct for what developments are favourable and what are not. 
  As an institution it has learnt through years of experience. It is quite capable 
  of taking a precipitate decision with little or no forward planning, and then 
  manoeuvring the developments to its advantage.</span></font></p>

  as in October 1987, it made no rational sense for the LTTE to turn the City 
  of Jaffna into a final battle zone and bring enormous suffering and loss to 
  the civilian population. For its brand of politics it is useful to turn Jaffna 
  into a stage for the enactment of 'martyrdom' and a city supposedly destroyed 
  by the enemy. The drama would be relished by Tamil nationalists abroad, irrespective 
  of the cost to cadre and people.</span></font></p>

  of LTTE leaders and in past developments, it is perhaps not so much the imminent 
  possibility of the Government's controlling the area and setting up a civil 
  administration that bothered the LTTE. The drama put on by the LTTE after the 
  Indo-Lanka Accord of 1987 precipitating war, showed that it was rattled by the 
  notion of sharing power with the rival Tamil groups it had disabled by force 
  and terror in 1986 (i.e., with 'traitors' in LTTE parlance). In late 1988, the 
  North-East Administration being in the hands of the EPRLF had sent the LTTE 
  scurrying into talks with the arch-enemy, the 'Sinhalese Government' in Colombo. 
  This time round, Thamilchelvan, chief of the LTTE's political wing, in his address 
  at Jaffna Hospital, had displayed strong emotion when he said, &quot;We will 
  never let the EPDP run the civil administration in Jaffna&quot;. Also notable 
  is the reckless attempt on the EPDP leader Devananda's life in Colombo in early 
  October.</span></font></p>

  resources and infrastructure that helped it to maintain a sizeable standing 
  army. The continuing emphasis on recruitment gives some hint as to why the LTTE 
  is trying to build up a large refugee population in the Vanni. It is partly 
  an attempt to reconstitute what it lost in Jaffna, albeit under much more primitive

  30th October, LTTE loudspeakers announced in Jaffna town: &quot;No one must 
  take this announcement lightly. We are doing battle intensely and bravely with 
  a demonic force. It will attack us from several directions. We too will respond 
  likewise. Since we are going to resist every inch against a state drunk with 
  racism, you people must evacuate for Thenmaratchi and Vadamarachi this same 
  night.&quot; LTTE men then went from house to house and ordered people to evacuate. 
  They were told, &quot;Jaffna town would soon become a battle zone. We are blowing 
  up Chemmani bridge at 4.00 a.m. If you are not out by then, you will have to 
  remain and face the consequences.&quot; By 6.30 p.m. Kandy Road was blocked 
  by panic stricken people trying to leave on foot. A man who decided not to leave

  been privileged sections of the civilian population who had received prior notice 
  of the exodus and had made an early exit with their moveable property. On the 
  30th evening people in different places were told different things. Some were 
  told that the Chemmani Bridge (Navatkuli Bridge) would be blown up at twelve 
  mid-night. In Uduvil people were told that the army would soon subject the area 
  to a rain of shells. Four shells were fired into the area, which were later 
  identified by the people as LTTE shells. People in Jaffna town were told that 
  an army attack from Mandathivu is imminent.</font></p>

  civilian casualties and suffering behind a mask of censorship. By its reprimand

  there had been a significant shortfall in the food rations sent to civilians 
  in Jaffna. It thus continued to prevent foreign journalists from going to the 
  North. In addition to rebuffing the U.N. concern, the government (Ministry of 
  Defence) also blocked relief workers, including doctors, from going into the 
  refugee area. It appeared that the government wanted to hide the developing 
  disaster from the rest of the world. Foreign journalists had therefore to be 
  content talking to civilians coming from the North. Most civilians were afraid 
  to talk. Nevertheless, the international media soon came to blame the LTTE for

<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:
12.0pt;'><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">As the arrmy advanced 
  and the people fled, several old people and many animals were left behind. During 
  the early hours of 9th October, after the army was in firm control of the Puttur 
  area, some shells were fired, which fell on the Puttur mission hospital, housing 
  several of the old who were left behind. Nine inmates were killed. Several people 
  in Jaffna identified the LTTE as having fired the shells and interpreted the 
  incident as a punishment meted out to those who remained behind SL Army lines. 
  Others opined that the shells had been meant to fall on nearby Puttur junction, 
  considered a strong point of the SL Army. A few days earlier state television 
  had shown army officers visiting the Methodist Mission and the medical officer 
  in charge had made an innocuous statement to the effect: &quot;We trust God 
  and God will give us peace.&quot; For some time the LTTE denied the allegation 
  that it had fired the shells, but later, according to witnesses, tacitly accepted 
  that it had done so. Several of these who had talked to the army and later came 
  into LTTE areas were subject to some harsh questioning. The incident along with 
  the events of July, suggested an increasingly hardening attitude against those 
  wanting to live in army controlled territory, despite the LTTE's inability to 
  offer acceptable alternatives. This had been in the making from 1990 when the 
  LTTE began projecting itself as a state power and started controlling the movement 
  of people. Those from the Islands who were displaced when the SL Army took control 
  in August 1990 had been refused permission by the LTTE to return to the Islands. 
  With all the reservations they had about an essentially alien Sri Lankan Army, 
  most of them, despite their insecurity, would have preferred going back to their 
  homes to being refugees. They have since lived in and around Jaffna. </font></p>

  the LTTE's expulsion order of 30th October with dread. Three months earlier 
  at the end of July, the LTTE had experienced its first spectacular military 
  failure in recent times in Manal Aru ('Weli Oya'). More than two hundred very 
  young LTTE cadre on an offensive were mown down. The LTTE immediately blamed 
  the failure on 'traitors'. About two weeks before the October 30th exodus order, 
  29 or so alleged traitors were executed in the Vanni area following the LTTE's 
  first reverses earlier in the month. A school principal was among those executed. 
  All were claimed to be informers of the SL Army. In the case of an elderly man 
  who was executed, his close relatives claimed that the man's only fault had 
  been that he sometimes drank too much and scolded the LTTE. Those who contemplated 
  remaining behind army lines took these executions as another warning.</span></font></p>

  earlier that the LTTE took serious note of the failure of its counter-attack 
  in Punnalaikadduwan leading to a radical change of strategy. There was little 
  military activity for a few days thereafter. On 17th October the army launched 
  'Operation Riveresa (Sunshine)' and resumed its advance towards Jaffna. Soon 
  after the fall of Neerveli, the LTTE began shifting its personnel, stores, equipment 
  and documents out of Jaffna. This further confirms that the LTTE had already 
  decided to quit Jaffna if the army persisted in its advance. At this point, 
  however, the possibility that the LTTE may ask the entire population to quit 
  Jaffna was not taken seriously. The City of Jaffna, unlike Moolai or Puttur, 
  was crucial to civilian life in the area. Where else could these hundreds of 
  thousands of people be provided with schools, a university, banks, shelter, 
  a regional hospital and administrative infrastructure?</font></p>

  people was, &quot;What is to become of us?&quot; On the one hand the LTTE was 
  evasive. Had it told the people of its intentions, there could have been an 
  orderly exodus. The LTTE instead repeated that it would fight to keep the army 
  out, and, even more emphatically, pressed the people to make their contributions

  time the existing refugees were exempt. But others were charged varying amounts. 
  Some businessmen were charged several lakhs. Those with family members abroad 
  were taxed according to the number and country, irrespective of access to their 
  money; for example, about Rs. 45,000 for a son in Switzerland. Since those living 
  in Jaffna were increasingly poorer and the sums higher, the collection was very 
  slow. The increased harshness of collection methods used left even LTTE supporters 
  disturbed. Four or five persons are known to have died of heart attack during 
  `negotiations' for the amounts to be paid. There were several scenes such as 
  of a lady with a child falling on her knees and pleading. Amounts which could 
  not be found were demanded with a note of menace. While the army moved nearer, 
  collection meetings were frequently organised where some direct objections were 
  raised: &quot;You are going to take our money and run away&quot;. This was strongly 
  denied, and the people were urged to somehow find the money.</span></font></p>

  cent as it were, as a sacred duty the people owed the LTTE, the LTTE acknowledged 
  no reciprocal obligation. The shortfall in government food supplies to the Jaffna 
  peninsula was being voiced abroad as an example of the Government's genocidal 
  intentions. In the meantime the LTTE, in view of its monopoly over purchase 
  and distribution, had some stocks of rice in Killinochchi. When it came to feeding 
  the people, it fell to the Government Agent of Jaffna to request money from 
  the Government in Colombo for funds to purchase rice from the LTTE for distribution 
  in Jaffna. The LTTE did little to hide the fact that the GA had to function 
  as its stooge.</span></font></p>

  their own, a sense of wanting to preserve something, a way of life or a civilisation, 
  that went beyond their individual interests and lifespan. Moreover faced with 
  a crisis and caught between two hostile forces neither of which was accountable 
  to them, and with no individual leaders they could trust, their instinctive 
  actions showed an independence their so-called 'sole legitimate representatives'

  had to contend with the near absence of food or shelter. Some who had arrived 
  before the forced exodus considered themselves lucky sharing houses with as 
  many as 70 people. But firewood was scarce and fires were extremely difficult 
  to light. Newer arrivals had to pay Rs.10 or more for a thatched coconut leaf 
  in a very unsatisfactory effort to keep away the rain. Some of them were young 
  mothers carrying infants. Others found standing room under the eaves of houses, 
  with two feet between the outer wall and the rain falling over the edge of the 
  roof. While attending to a call of nature, the neighbour was asked to keep the

  that a senior member of a family had to get up about 3.00 A.M. after sleeping 
  late and join a bread queue 2 miles long. Later tokens were issued where a person 
  would first queue up for a token in the morning, and later spend 2 hours in

  slaves. If this is their behaviour now, how would it be when we get Eelam?&quot; 
  Unlike in other times this was not greeted by others in fearful silence or with 
  words of caution. But others joined in with the kind of sarcasm for which Jaffna 
  is renowned. One shouted back, &quot;Only those with knowledge must speak. Others 
  must shut up.&quot; Another said, &quot;Shut up or these fellows 'will land 
  you one on the forehead'.&quot; Someone else added, &quot;Watch it, they would

  phase of the exodus there were a large number of people in Jaffna who were determined 
  to remain. An important consideration for them was the presence of the ICRC 
  and the Jaffna hospital safety zone it controlled. In order to break this, the 
  LTTE's strategy was to first apply pressure on the medical staff to move Jaffna 
  hospital. When the news of the exodus order reached Jaffna hospital, pandemonium 
  broke loose. The surgical team had a heavy schedule and was operating late. 
  When they heard about the order, they walked out and sat down in the lounge, 
  paralysed by shock. The LTTE had spread the word that the SL Army was coming 
  into the city from Mandaitivu, and that all the doctors had fled. A large number 
  of patients, medical staff and a few junior doctors had fled the hospital to 
  join the milling crowds choking Kandy Road. In many cases, the patients themselves 
  or their relatives pulled out catheters and tubes connected to the body and 
  left the hospital. (Some of them were admitted to Chavakacheri hospital, days 
  later; but what happened to the rest of the patients is guesswork.) In the intensive 
  Care Unit at Jaffna, one patient died of cardiac arrest as the nurses had fled. 
  Nearly all LTTE injured that night were cleared by the LTTE medical team. But 
  the senior staff at Jaffna hospital and a core of the others continued to remain 
  and work as a team.</font></p>

  of the hospital doctors about 3rd November. It was clear that he was talking 
  at two levels. At one level, the diplomatic level, he was very reassuring - 
  the LTTE needed the hospital for some more days. He reiterated the position 
  that the LTTE would respect the ICRC zone and the agreement concerning it. They 
  would never, he said, force the closure of Jaffna hospital. But, at the other 
  level, there were undertones suggesting that they would do the very opposite. 
  One was his reference to never allowing the rival Tamil group EPDP to run a 
  civil administration in Jaffna cited earlier. Another was a strongly stated 
  aim that &quot;they would never let go of their younger generation [from under 
  their wings]&quot;. This meant that no family with children (i.e prospective 
  recruits) would be allowed to live outside the control of the LTTE. He also 
  said that if either side broke the ICRC zone agreement, which required 72 hours' 
  notice, there would be no safe access to the outside world thereafter. Some 
  of the doctors interpreted Thamilchelvan's talk as giving in effect 72 hours' 
  notice for the closure of Jaffna hospital, since this anticipated event had 
  been very much in the air. The doctors raised questions and argued back. He 
  was told, &quot;You are going to revert back to guerilla warfare. But one day 
  you hope to come back and run this place, and then the hospital would be necessary. 
  Is it not therefore better for you to preserve this hospital?&quot; Throughout 
  the interview Thamilchelvan remained smiling and seemed to be patient and attentive. 
  Finally, he told them, &quot;Do whatever the ICRC tells you.&quot;</span></font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:
12.0pt;'><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">The doctoors were 
  relieved. They thought that they had won their case. Thamilchelvan had also 
  been to see the ICRC. The following day, the whole picture was reversed, when 
  they heard that the ICRC was considering pulling out and they would have to 
  follow. The same day, a few concerned doctors went to see the ICRC. From what 
  they gathered it appeared that Thamilchelvan had persuaded the ICRC that everyone 
  in Jaffna was leaving, so that there would be no reason for the ICRC to remain. 
  One of the doctors asked the ICRC poignantly, &quot;There are a hundred thousand 
  people left in Jaffna. Are you going to leave them all and go away?&quot; The 
  ICRC representative responded with some alarm, &quot;One hundred thousand? Or, 
  do you mean one thousand?&quot; The doctor replied, &quot;One hundred thousand 
  is correct.&quot; He explained the locations of the refugees in Valikamam, including 
  those out of town, and said that nearly all of them intended staying. It was 
  from this conversation that the doctors concluded that Thamilchelvan had persuaded 
  the ICRC that all the people were quitting. </font></p>

  the LTTE intended to mine all the access routes to their zone, in which event 
  they would all be trapped. He then said sadly, &quot;I might personally like 
  to remain. But the head office in Geneva would probably order us to move.&quot; 
  The doctors were crestfallen. </span></font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:
12.0pt;'><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">From the following 
  day the ICRC prepared for the eventuality of moving out. The doctors were consulted 
  about their preferences and lists were made of those who would work in Chavakacheri 
  and Pt. Pedro. The Jaffna hospital zone had been patrolled by the ICRC and any 
  LTTE cadre carrying arms within this zone was scolded and asked to move out. 
  But after the LTTE had ordered the exodus, armed cadre were often seen in the 
  safety zone. The ICRC told the doctors to be ready to move out on foot at short 
  notice, adding to the alarm among civilians.</font></p>

  This number kept declining as even some serious patients quit. The talk got 
  around the hospital that the LTTE was placing its cannon on the zonal boundary 
  to fire at the army across the lagoon at Mandaitivu. Firing noises were also 
  regularly heard within the hospital zone. The LTTE had ordered the shops in 
  Jaffna to close. Although those in Jaffna had provisions, they had to cycle 
  to Thenmaratchi for fruits and vegetables.</span></font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:
12.0pt;'><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">The LTTE''s attitude 
  towards the civilians too was becoming openly intimidatory. A large number of 
  refugees were at John Bosco school next to the ICRC at the Temple Road-Rakka 
  Road junction. The LTTE fired what are believed to have been fake shells at 
  this camp. Shells were also fired near Ariyakulam and Pathirakali Amman temple, 
  but no casualties were reported. The LTTE claimed that the shells were fired 
  by the SL Army. But from the sound the people were certain that it was the LTTE. 
  Near Kanthasamy Kovil some refugees wee beaten by masked men. Sometimes masked 
  persons went into private premises, pulled out knives, helped themselves to 
  young coconuts and behaved in an intimidatory manner. About 2nd November the 
  last of the refugees were forced out of the Medical Faculty of the University 
  of Jaffna. <a href="#Top">[Top]</a> </font></p>

  was better to leave soon while they could remove some of their moveable property, 
  rather than wait for the last minute and lose everything if the LTTE chased 
  them out. Once more the exodus picked up. Persons who had left Jaffna were prevented 
  from returning by police sentries manning Navatkuli. Those coming to collect 
  their things were given a day-pass until 4.00 p.m.. Overstaying was an offence. 
  The road to Chavakacheri was regularly crowded with people removing their things. 
  Some doctors visiting the bank observed, &quot;The big guys have created an 
  atmosphere of panic. The people are now moving&quot;.</span></font></p>

  and set about targeting them for intimidation. Sometimes gun positions were 
  mounted close by or rockets were fired. Those walking the roads were sometimes 
  deliberately given a fright when a mortar shell landed close enough. A house 
  was sometimes surrounded and the inmates asked to come out. They were told, 
  &quot;The army is coming to Jaffna because of Tamil traitors. We have received 
  information that there is a traitor in this house. We will conduct a full search. 
  Why would people want to remain in Jaffna when the army takes over, unless they 
  are traitors?&quot; Sometimes the householder had the presence of mind to throw 
  back at the LTTE its pretence of legality, by insisting that the house could 
  not be searched unless they came with a warrant from Thamilchelvan. Such efforts 
  were of no avail. Search meant that contents of bags were spilt out and even 
  women's items gone through one by one.</span></font></p>

  there were periods of little discernible activity on the side of the Government

  well as noise from the intensity of fighting outside town reached a point where 
  most remaining residents left their homes and went to schools and churches. 
  During the early hours of 12th November the LTTE made a final bid to drive away 
  the remaining civilians from town. About 2.00 a.m. the LTTE broke down the gates 
  of Chudikuli Girls' College and barged in noisily. The refugees were ordered 
  to assemble. Militant cadre barged into class rooms and dragged out sleeping 
  refugees with no respect for age or sex. An infirm lady who was semi-blind was 
  grabbed by the wrist and pulled off her bed, while her daughter screamed in 
  protest.</span></font></p>

  give your names and addresses.&quot; No one spoke or protested. After sunrise 
  the refugees dispersed to various churches. The LTTE was to bring lorries to 
  transport those remaining. (From the time the LTTE started moving its things, 
  it had commandeered all lorries belonging to Multi-Purpose Co-operative Societies.) 
  Some clergymen accepted the LTTE's move to shift them with resignation. One 
  said, &quot;They want us to go. We have little choice.&quot; Some strong resistance 
  appears to have been put up by the Ceylon Pentecostal Mission. It was reported 
  that in a melee, a leading elder, an electrical engineer, had been pushed down 
  and dragged by his feet into a lorry, thereby causing bruises to his body. The 
  pastor of the Kandy Road church is said to have been hit on the shoulder resulting

  had been completely ransacked and turned into a fortress and a nerve-centre 
  for the final defence of Thinnevely. There were trenches across the roads in 
  the locality to serve as tank traps. Sandbags were evident everywhere. Narrow 
  trenches led to the boundary wall to accommodate defensive positions made up 
  of stacked sandbags. There were also gun positions all over,</font></p>

  and laborious years through which the institution was built by dedicated souls, 
  some of whom are, thankfully, at rest. Those long hours of committee meetings, 
  consultations with architects and contractors, trips abroad for recruitment 
  and canvassing of staff and materials, hassles with the Government for funds 
  and permission to import equipment - all this was to disappear in the twinkling 
  of an eye, in a brief and futile military encounter. In other countries at war, 
  armies kept away from monuments to the heritage of the people, and even as the 
  enemy advanced, dedicated people remained in those institutions to protect them.

  themselves after a day's work, applying soap and bathing in leisurely fashion. 
  The war seemed far away from these young boys. Did they realise that at this

  be moved. From many parts of Valikamam there were reports of elders heard screaming 
  as those younger left them in their homes and joined the exodus. Several of 
  those about to quit Jaffna on 13th November looked up their animals for what 
  was probably to be the last time. Although the fighting and sounds of shelling 
  were heavy, the SL Army was careful not to shell Jaffna town. Cows about to 
  calve and gazing helplessly had to be left to fend for themselves. Some forced 
  to leave behind their dogs, walked miles to leave them in familiar surroundings. 
  On that day the sound of shelling could be heard loudest in the northern precincts 
  of Jaffna. Buildings were vibrating as though there was a giant earthquake. 
  The dogs left behind were transfixed by fear or were running aimlessly only 
  to find that one place was no better than the other. In most parts of Jaffna 
  and surroundings there was an unbearable stench coming from animals starved 
  to death and rotting on the roads. Those dogs that were alive, filled the air 
  with their constant howling for their masters (themselves wailing) and because 
  of the stench of death.</span></font></p>

  episodes in the history of the Tamil people that deserves to be meditated upon 
  with sympathy, trying to imagine oneself in the shoes of a handful of doctors 
  and a few dozen individuals called upon to make agonising personal decisions. 
  Apart from problems of medical ethics in such extreme situations as the country 
  had not faced before, it also raises some questions about the role and obligations 
  of the ICRC as an institution.</span></font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:
12.0pt;'><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">In the fiirst few 
  days that followed 30th October, the LTTE, as pointed out, had made its intentions 
  clear. Soon after the announcement some surgical equipment went missing, and 
  the authorities had to place some new locks. The LTTE was brazenly flouting 
  the condition that no arms should be carried within the zone. From the first 
  day the LTTE started removing stocks of medicine and the hospital generators 
  one by one. Yet it continued to bring its injured cadre in for treatment.</font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:

<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:
12.0pt;'><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">The ICRC''s conduct 
  was also wobbly. It seemed to have accepted that the closure was inevitable 
  and to have swallowed the LTTE's reading of the situation. This was that the 
  patients, people and even medical staff were moving into Thenmaratchi and that 
  soon there would be no work at the hospital. The senior doctors were however 
  determined to keep the hospital open and to remain in Jaffna. In this they were 
  supported by most of the junior doctors and by medical staff who had not quit. 
  The junior doctors even helped in menial tasks such as cooking, and they all 
  worked as a team. The ICRC's attitude however indicated that it wanted to move. 
  As the doctors understood it, Thamilchelvan had `really scared the daylights' 
  out of the ICRC by threatening to cut off access. Worse still, a shell fell 
  near the ICRC office, a shell whose source is disputed. The general opinion 
  among the people was that it was an LTTE shell. Others however maintained that 
  it was an SL Army shell on the grounds that the explosion was louder than that 
  obtaining from LTTE shells. But given that the area was not subject to general 
  shelling by the SL Army, it would appear strange that the army from 3 or 4 miles 
  away should aim a single shell at the location of the ICRC office. </font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:

lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.1pt;'>From abouut 7th November the ICRC started taking down their flags and 
  insignia, heralding the closure and spreading panic among all those who had 
  depended on the ICRC zone for their protection. The doctors at the hospital 
  and the ICRC seemed to be working towards different ends and the communication 
  gap was quite evident. Mr. Georg Cunz, the head of the ICRC mission was guarded 
  and diplomatic in what he said. But remarks attributed to the ICRC team as a 
  whole gave doctors the feeling that they were very much misunderstood and that 
  the ICRC team was more influenced by what the LTTE told them than by the ground 
  situation in the hospital. Of course no one could take the LTTE's reputation 
  lightly and there was the shell near the ICRC office of unknown provenance. 
  </span></font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:
12.0pt;'><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">The ICRC opened a 
  mobile clinic with Jaffna Hospital doctors in Thenmaratchi and the medical doctor 
  of the ICRC team was constantly comparing statistics between Jaffna Hospital 
  and Chavakacheri Hospital. A member of the Jaffna Hospital surgical team took 
  a breather from a grinding routine by standing on the balcony of the house officers' 
  quarters. The ICRC nurse who passed by below addressed a remark to him, &quot;There 
  are lots of casualties in the ward, why are you idling?&quot;. There was a regular 
  insinuation attributed to the ICRC that the hospital doctors were shirkers. 
  By the time the ICRC started pulling down their flags, the doctors came to know 
  of remarks from the ICRC team to the effect, &quot;Why are the doctors drinking 
  tea [here in Jaffna hospital] and wasting their time [when there is so much 
  work elsewhere]?&quot; The ICRC seemed unable to see the value the native folk 
  and the doctors attached to Jaffna Hospital as a key community institution that 
  had to be preserved despite temporary setbacks.</font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:
12.0pt;'><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">The LTTE was at the 
  same time working hard at different levels to close down Jaffna Hospital. There 
  was a great deal of individual canvassing of patients, staff and doctors by 
  others sympathetic to the LTTE. Their fears were constantly played upon. But 
  the senior doctors and a core of junior doctors and medical staff worked as 
  a team and stood firm in their resolve to keep the hospital functioning. The 
  LTTE had always feared any showing of community spirit and cohesiveness that 
  was outside its direct control.</font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:
12.0pt;'><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">The LTTE used some 
  of what is known in military parlance as `softening up', before the final coup 
  de grace in the form of a carrot. There was intimidation in the form of remarks. 
  An LTTE patient who was receiving treatment, for example, addressed a remark 
  to a nurse, &quot;Why are the doctors waiting here without going? We have marked 
  who the traitors are. We know how to deal with them!&quot; A very worried nurse 
  communicated this to the doctors.</font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:
12.0pt;'><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">On the 100th of November, 
  ll days after the exodus order, there were 300 patients in the hospital with 
  a little more than 1000 beds, providing more than enough work for the staff 
  who remained. Many of them were elderly patients, seriously ill paediatric patients 
  and women who had undergone caesarian operations. LTTE agents came in vehicles 
  and made a determined bid to get the patients out. Intense pressure was applied 
  on the patients and their relatives and what went on was more or less public. 
  As soon as someone gave-in to pressure, someone, in most cases the relative, 
  simply pulled out the naso-gastric tubes or the IV (intravenous) drips. The 
  patient was then loaded onto a stretcher and driven away to Chavakacheri. In 
  the meantime the LTTE had told the ICRC that there were no patients in the hospital.</font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:
12.0pt;'><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.1pt;'>The battlle was simultaneously joined in by some of the doctors. While 
  on one side the LTTE was asking patients to go, the doctors went around reassuring 
  the patients that they would be around and that there was no need to leave. 
  Within a few hours, however, the bulk of the patients had been carried away. 
  Some of the doctors asked the ICRC to station one person permanently in the 
  hospital so that they could see for themselves what was going on. The ICRC representative 
  replied that there were no patients in the hospital. The doctors went in for 
  a quick count and told the ICRC that there were 30 patients! the ICRC representative 
  then promised to send someone around regularly to take a look.</span></font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:

lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.1pt;'>On the foollowing morning or the one after (12th), Thamilchelvan came 
  to deliver the final thrust. He used the well-tried method of a totalitarian 
  force. Having constantly rattled the nerves of the defenders of Jaffna hospital 
  and built up fear, he offered a carrot to a chosen few whom he judged to be 
  vulnerable and were key to the continuance of the hospital. It was a gamble 
  that paid off. Had it failed, it would have increased resistance, creating more 
  problems for the LTTE. Thamilchelvan met a closed group comprising a few hospital 
  consultants and offered their families passes to go to Colombo, including their 
  teen-aged children who are normally not eligible for passes. The consultants 
  accepted. Thamilchelvan left after promising to collect a list of names that 
  evening and issue the passes. A way out of the draconian pass system had become 
  a lure that few could resist.</span></font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:
12.0pt;'><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">Immediateely afterwards 
  the hospital staff met. One of the consultants who had accepted Tamilchelvan's 
  offer represented the position slightly differently. He told them that all the 
  hospital staff were offered passes for their families. He said that all who 
  wanted passes could include their names in the list that Thamilchelvan would 
  collect in the evening. But the nurses and other staff had already heard that 
  only the consultants were included in the offer. Some of them asked, crestfallen, 
  &quot;Then how about us?&quot; It was a severe blow to the junior doctors who 
  along with the remaining junior staff, had totally trusted their seniors and 
  had given themselves entirely to working as a team. The hospital superintendent 
  was also offended that those who had agreed to Thamilchelvan had never consulted 
  her in the matter. The consultants were urged to reconsider. At the meeting 
  at 3.00 P.M that day, the majority of the consultants voted to accept Thamilchelvan's 
  deal. The fate of the hospital was sealed. The ICRC was told of the decision 
  to move the hospital. Mr. Cunz's face, it is reported, brightened with plain 
  relief. The evacuation of Jaffna hospital was fixed for the 14th.</font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:

lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.1pt;'>It was allso evident that Thamilchelvan's attitude to the doctors changed 
  after the consultants fell for his offer. He seemed to have lost respect, particularly 
  towards those advocating his offer. He never came to collect the list of names 
  and avoided the doctors thereafter. For several of those who had agreed, the 
  obtaining of passes became a long drawn out harassing affair. The blow was also 
  keenly felt by those who had remained in Jaffna drawing strength from the hospital. 
  The methods used to expel civilians became decisively harsh following the LTTE's 
  success in closing the hospital. The doctors themselves had drawn comfort from 
  the decision of the Roman Catholic Bishop in Jaffna to remain.Despite pressure 
  and several visits from the LTTE, he and the bulk of the clergy were firmly 
  resolved to remain. The Bishop made a trip to Colombo in connection with two 
  of his clergy detained for questioning in Colombo. By the time he returned to 
  peninsular Jaffna the situation had changed. Following LTTE harassment and shelling 
  (in which no one was injured) around St.Patrick's, an area having several key 
  Catholic institutions, the bulk of the orders of clergy and nuns had quit, along 
  with most of the people who took refuge in these institutions. The Bishop too 
  then kept out of Valikamam.</span></font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:
12.0pt;'><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">A comic eevent took 
  place on the 13th when the LTTE sent vehicles to evacuate the remaining civilians, 
  which also showed how some of the young cadre innocently carried out their order 
  to clean up the city. A cadre stopped his bus outside the hospital, sounded 
  his horn, and shouted out to the lady superintendent standing in front, &quot;Get 
  in madam, this is the last bus out of Jaffna. If you miss this one, you will 
  never get another one!&quot;</font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:
12.0pt;'><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">The exoduus of the 
  hospital to Pt. Pedro was arranged by the ICRC with meticulous care. But once 
  there, the ICRC appeared to wash its hands off the Jaffna hospital. The hospital 
  staff had looked upon the ICRC in some sense as a guarantor of their security 
  and this had influenced their decision to stay on till the last. Since security 
  reasons were among those compelling the movement of the hospital, the staff 
  felt that they should be moved to a place that was at least safe. This was not 
  the case with Pt. Pedro which was subject to shelling by the SL Army and there 
  was no officially accepted security zone around the hospital there. Doctors 
  applied to the ICRC for transport on their ship that sailed regularly between 
  Pt. Pedro and Trincomalee. This was at first refused. Mr.Cunz later suggested 
  that if those wanting transport write jointly to the Ministry of Defence in 
  Colombo and obtain their sanction, the ICRC would transport them. Such a letter 
  was given to the ICRC for forwarding. It was later reliably learnt that the 
  letter stopped with the ICRC office in Colombo, and was not forwarded. The ICRC 
  in Pt. Pedro, however, told them that the defence ministry had refused permission. 
  On the other hand it seemed to them that the Government which wanted to reopen 
  Jaffna Hospital would like to get them down to Colombo, since from Colombo, 
  the Government would have better control over the doctors than when they remained 
  in Tiger territory. Further, whereas the LTTE would want to keep doctors under 
  their control, the ICRC too, it appeared, was playing a game of delicate balancing 
  between the two armed forces it had to work with. In actual fact, the major 
  actors were acting in such a manner where the people were being hemmed into 
  smaller and smaller areas and were being used as pawns in a game. The ICRC also 
  contributed to this by refusing to open a safe passage to the people out of 
  this contracting circle. Its ships regularly returned to Trincomalee almost 
  empty. </font></p>

  the continued security and functioning of Jaffna Hospital for more than 5 years. 
  It has acted as a commonly trusted intermediary in peace moves and arranged 
  exchanges of prisoners and visits to them. It has also served as a foreign presence 
  witnessing the plight of ordinary people. However, the ICRC has the practice 
  of changing delegates every 6 months. Staff whose experience had just enabled 
  them to understand the intricacies of the situation are changed. Several of 
  the delegates had proven their worth, standing firm for the hospital. But during 
  the recent crisis, the individual delegates proved to be only too human, like 
  the Jaffna doctors. <a href="#Top">[Top]</a></span></font></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:
12.0pt;'><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">The last evacuees 
  went to Chavakacheri, Killinochchi and the majority to Vadamaratchi. Many of 
  those who went to Killinochchi hoped to find their way to Colombo. Vadamaratchi 
  was less crowded than Chavakacheri, and bread was more easily available since 
  there were more bakeries. Even here there were queues and, like elsewhere in 
  Jaffna, cash too was hardly available. Friends and well-wishers helped those 
  who arrived in Vadamaratchi to find rooms in Pt Pedro. But here there were constant 
  reminders of the war in the form of shelling. A few days later, on 14th November, 
  a long convoy of vehicles with ICRC flags, preceded by motor-cycle outriders 
  reached Pt Pedro. This was the final evacuation of the ICRC along with Jaffna 
  hospital. For a few more days lorries and bullock carts continued to go to Jaffna 
  to fetch the properties of institutions and private belongings. But most people 
  left behind everything. The banks too had moved to Pt. Pedro with whatever 
  records they could carry. But their coffers were empty. The Government also 
  placed severe restrictions on the carrying of cash into Jaffna; even institutions 
  were refused permission by the Ministry of Defence to take cash for salary payments. 
  Each individual going north was restricted to Rs 5000/-. Thus people and institutions 
  like orphanages were placed in a position where they could neither operate their 
  local bank accounts nor get cash from Colombo.</font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:
12.0pt;'><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">Withdrawaals from 
  banks were restricted to Rs 500/-. While the Government restricted the flow 
  of cash, the LTTE, which received priority in withdrawing its huge cash deposits 
  from the banks, had plenty of cash. It had also been insisting on cash payments 
  for its National Defence Fund contributions. As the exhausted refugees poured 
  into Vadamaratchi, the LTTE's NDF collections from Vadamaratchi folk went into 
  top gear. Those who were desperate for cash had to part with their gold to the 
  LTTE for a ridiculously low price. The LTTE capitalised on the suffering of 
  the people in various ways. For example, the proprietor of the Milk White soap 
  company wanted a pass to go into Jaffna and collect his stock of soap from 
  the stores. The LTTE agreed on condition that they would be given half the stock. 
  Soap was being sold under LTTE monopoly for the astronomical price of Rs 70 
  a cake. </font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:
12.0pt;'><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">Within liimits the 
  LTTE had striven to keep the elite on its side. As Pt. Pedro became crowded 
  with refugees, the LTTE got about looking for houses for the elite. Several 
  refugees who had just found shelter and settled down, found themselves virtually 
  getting thrown out on the streets with bag and baggage after being promised 
  alternative accommodation. The only consolation they found was in tears, until 
  some good soul came along to help.</font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:
12.0pt;'><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">The LTTE press, radio 
  and loudspeakers constantly advised people to move to the Vanni. Fear also got 
  around that a second exodus from Thenmaratchi and Vadamaratchi into the Vanni 
  would be enforced. The LTTE was providing free transport across the Jaffna lagoon 
  to the mainland, but was not in general permitting movement into Jaffna - i.e., 
  a one-way passage was on offer.</font></p>

  the LTTE and get trapped, it would be better to go to Colombo while they could 
  return to Jaffna when the situation improves. Long queues gathered outside pass

  passes. Several of the offices were stoned by frustrated crowds. <a href="#Top">[Top]</a></span></font></p>

-.1pt;'>Amidst thhe trauma and disorder of being thrown out of Jaffna, there were 
  just three matters in which normality quickly returned. First, in the matter 
  of recruitment. Displaced people entering Navatkuli were greeted with messages 
  on banners with a yellow background at regular intervals. Young men and women 
  were urged to join the LTTE to liberate Jaffna and were told that there was 
  a recruitment office nearby at their service. A meeting of the Jaffna University 
  Students Union was called at Chavakacheri. This was not to discuss education 
  or the future of the University. The matter was simply this. After perhaps 6 
  or 7 years of trying to get a degree there was virtually no university. The 
  South was essentially hostile and was not going to accommodate them. They were 
  on the roads with nowhere to go. Likewise with high school students who were 
  geared to advancement through education. The LTTE had precipitated a situation 
  where there was to be no school in the foreseeable future. Thousands of 16 or 
  17 year olds who had worked very hard in difficult conditions for their G.C.E.O.level 
  examinations in December felt hopeless and desperate when the examinations had 
  to be cancelled. The message now was: Join us, the LTTE, and with greater numbers 
  we would get the separate state of Eelam quickly. Then you could go back to 
  whatever you want to do. Otherwise you will rot on the roads for years.&quot; 
  If the number of university students joining the LTTE was negligible in the 
  past, it was now significantly higher. For some months now it has been fairly 
  common for LTTE cadre to tell young boys that if they did not join the LTTE 
  now, they would be conscripted later. This message was often heard by the young 
  fleeing through Thenmaratchi and the Vanni.</span></font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:
12.0pt;'><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">The seconnd aspect 
  of normality is in the collection of taxes. In the areas where the refugees 
  have been dispersed, the tax collectors have returned to work very efficiently. 
  Goods sold are taxed and collections to the National Defence Fund are going 
  on. At the beginning payment to this fund was a requirement to cross the lagoon 
  of those wanting to go to Colombo (This appears to have been relaxed when the 
  LTTE decided to move as many as were willing across the lagoon into Killinochchi). 
  The Tiger greed for gold also quickly surfaced. It has been decreed that only 
  the LTTE could purchase gold. The price initially offered at Rs.3000 per sovereign 
  was about 50% to 60% of the market rate. There are also restrictions on the 
  carrying of jewellery by those leaving the North. By comparison, the Muslims 
  the LTTE chased out of Jaffna in 1990 had to surrender all their valuables. 
  Women then were subject to humiliating body searches with sometimes ear-rings 
  being plucked off bleeding ears - all by women cadre. The recent extortion exercise 
  was observed with suppressed anger by people who had parted with their cash-in-hand 
  to meet their payment to the LTTE and were the next day thrown out of Jaffna 
  with nothing in hand. Owing to the monopoly the LTTE had enforced, later reports 
  said that gold had been sold for much less than 3,000 rupees a sovereign by 
  people desperate for cash.</font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:

lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.1pt;'>Thirdly, new pass offices were quickly established after the computers 
  originally from the University were relocated. A new centre was established 
  in Kodikamam. The elderly wanting to go to Colombo had little difficulty. Children 
  were almost always refused. For a short time the minimum age for refusal was 
  raised from 10 to 14 and has since dropped to 12. The maximum age is 30. Moreover, 
  the LTTE was not too keen on restraining middle class persons who feel they 
  have alternatives, such as going abroad, and hence would be a nuisance to the 
  LTTE in the Vanni. On the other hand such persons had in general proved very 
  useful abroad. But this leniency ended after a short time, when the issuing 
  of passes was stopped.</span></font></p>

lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.1pt;'>Those croossing the lagoon into Killinochchi found things much better 
  organised for long term recruitment and settlement. By contrast the LTTE had 
  done nothing or very little to cater to long term civilian welfare in Thenmaratchi 
  and Vadamaratchi. Those crossing the lagoon and landing at Alankerni on the 
  mainland were offered plain-tea by courtesy of Thamil Eelam Boat Service and 
  the Thamil Eelam Administrative Service. Then came the usual tractor ride to 
  Nallur and a free but jam-packed lorry ride to Killinochchi. There, shelter 
  was provided in schools, with school teachers, boy-scouts, and cubs providing 
  supervision and free food. They were later taken to shelters from where vehicles 
  proceeded to different locations in the Vanni. By the 9th of November UNHCR 
  lorries were seen in Killinochchi suggesting that food sent by the Government 
  had begun to come in. Refugees going to villages in the Vanni were given free 
  food for two days. Within that time they were enabled to register with the local 
  headman and start receiving government rations. They were then given land, mammoties, 
  and other agricultural implements to begin cultivation. The Tamil Refugees' 
  Organization (TRO), an NGO started by the LTTE, was at the fore-front of this 
  activity and is responsible for Vadamaratchi, Thenmaratchi and Vanni. Formerly, 
  all NGOs were registered as part of the NGO Forum, giving an illusion of partnership 
  and democratic functioning. The illusion is no longer there with the TRO openly 
  calling the shots. All other international NGOs have to work through the TRO, 
  thereby giving the impression that it was the LTTE that was their benefactor. 
  The bulk of the resources at its command come from the government machinery 
  and other NGOs. All this suggests that the LTTE had put considerable effort 
  into this and had long-term plans for the displaced people. It would also appear 
  that the LTTE wishes to empty the population of Jaffna into Vanni.</span></font></p>

  control in refugee camps being used to recruit minors. At least to these NGOs, 
  the TRO has acknowledged that the recruitment of minors is wrong. The matter 
  no doubt ends there. Initially there was a great deal of anger against the LTTE 
  among displaced persons thrown into chaotic conditions in the Vanni. The TRO 
  has tried hard to soothe the anger and bring some order.</span></font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:

lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:

  so as to apply pressure on the population to move to the Vanni. This led to 
  dissatisfaction among relief workers who had been working hard. International 
  NGOs are worried. Following the exodus order, they reluctantly moved out of 
  Jaffna into Thenmaratchi and Vadamaratchi. They had decided that they would 
  not move again. Should the LTTE engineer a second exodus into the Vanni from 
  the remainder of the peninsula, these NGOs are apparently not quite sure what 
  they would do.</span></font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:

  children to whom the age restriction applied, did so by paying sums of up to 
  Rs 1 lakh at the Thandikulam crossing point. Others who came to Thandikulam 
  without passes paid sums of money from Rs 10,000 upwards after negotiation and 
  were allowed to pass over to Vavuniya. Once the LTTE stopped issuing passes, 
  there were also scenes at Thandikulam, where for example A.Level boys threw 
  stones at the pass office. In some places, the LTTE opened the pass office for 
  a short time and issued a few passes to calm the unrest and then closed it again. 
  From mid-November travellers reported signs of discontent among some LTTE cadre 
  they met. Some complained that the big ones were not to be found and they were 
  at a loose end. Not everything went smoothly for the LTTE in the Vanni. It had 
  to find housing for a large number of its supporters who had come over. This 
  was causing some heart-burn. The editor of the 'Eelanatham', the LTTE's paper, 
  whose wife is from an upper middle class background, was said to be dissatisfied 
  with the house he had been assigned in Uruthirapuram. <a href="#Top">[Top]</a></span></font></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:
12.0pt;'><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">Looking aat the events 
  over the last year, it would appear that during the peace process the Government 
  was not clear about the nature of the LTTE. Moreover, during war it lacked 
  clarity and consistency in its approach to the Tamil people, whom, it said, 
  it sought to win over politically. One of its marked achievements is however 
  the peace package announced at the end of July, laying down the outlines of 
  a political settlement. During the peace process the Government paid little 
  attention to the complications arising from the nature of the LTTE. Having consulted 
  the Tamil elite in Colombo and those abroad, the Foreign Minister, who had no 
  grass-roots contact, maintained confidently that the Tamil people supported 
  the Government's efforts for peace with the LTTE. These were ultimately noises 
  modulated by the LTTE and kept changing with the LTTE's strategic considerations. 
  Once the war was precipitated the Government and the foreign office became hostile 
  to NGO and other voices which tried to represent the people who were victims 
  of military measures.</font></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:
12.0pt;'><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">In both tthese phases 
  there has been a notable lack of conception regarding the place and interests 
  of the ordinary Tamil people. The manner in which the current war is being conducted 
  has shown little respect for the civilians as people whom the Government is 
  trying to win over. With the exception of Jaffna town and suburbs, bombing and 
  shelling in other areas appears to have been untargetted and done in the way 
  of reprisals. It was pointed out earlier that most of the hundred civilian deaths 
  during October occurred as the result of bombing and shelling well outside the 
  combat zone. Vadamaratchi and Thenmaratchi had been regularly shelled during 
  the month of November and these are areas to which displaced people have moved 
  in large numbers. Shelling of these areas had notably taken place during times 
  when fighting was heavy and the army sustained casualties-i.e., shelling had 
  been frequent from about 10th to 14th November.</font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:
12.0pt;'><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">Two civillians were 
  killed in the Mattuvil area in Thenmaratchi on the 10th. On 11th November a 
  refugee child was killed when shells fell in Maruvan Pulavu, Thenmaratchi, on 
  the Kerativu road. Two were killed in Kaithadi, Thenmaratchi, on the 12th. On 
  the same day one civilian was killed near Thikkam in Valvettithurai. Many more 
  were injured in all these incidents. During the 13th night a total of about 
  40 shells were accounted by civilians to have fallen in several parts of Vadamaratchi, 
  most of them on the coast or into the sea. Only one shell is known to have fallen 
  on or near an LTTE women's camp in the Mattuvil-Nunavil area killing a female 
  and injuring two others. The LTTE later claimed that they had apprehended a 
  woman spy with a walkie talkie! On 21st November the air force dropped bombs 
  in the Mullaitivu area. In Nedunkerni 4 persons from three families were killed 
  and 15 were injured. At Kachilamadu 5 members of a single family were killed. 
  Some of the injured are receiving treatment in Vavuniya. In the Navatkuli-Kaithady 
  area bombs were dropped near a refugee camp - no reports of casualties. Such 
  indiscriminate shelling of civilian areas helps to negate in the minds of ordinary 
  people the apparent pains taken to ensure good behaviour of advancing troops. 
  </font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:
12.0pt;'><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">The same lack of 
  clear conception of civilian welfare also applies to the banning of travel through 
  Jaffna lagoon. If it is done for a short term purpose, the civilians should 
  be told so. As it is, this threatens to become another fiasco like what happened 
  under the UNP government. For the lack of an alternative passage Tamil civilians 
  travelled through Jaffna lagoon for three years under fire from the navy and 
  the air force. Well over a hundred civilian lives were lost. In one incident 
  in early January 1993, 30 to 60 civilians were massacred with knives and guns 
  by the Sri Lankan Navy who boarded some of the boats. Those who lost their lives 
  included government servants who were required to go to Colombo to transact 
  government business. </font></p>

  One of them, Brig. Karunatilake, was in charge of the brigade at Valaichenai 
  that was responsible for the notorious Eastern University disappearances during 
  September 1990. There are also cases being taken up against him pertaining to 
  his earlier activity during the JVP insurgency. This again shows a certain lack 
  of concern about civilian welfare and civilian sensibilities. </span></font></p>

  that the operation had been discussed with the more influential sections of 
  the diplomatic community in Colombo and that some agreement was reached (One 
  shell had fallen within the ICRC zone, in front of the surgeon's house. The 
  bombing in Ariyalai East has been referred to already. Several shells fired 
  from Mandaitivu fell about the Gurunagar coast). The Government itself fails 
  to have appreciated its strong position in this respect. Having scored a success 
  in influencing the UN Secretary General to make a statement, the LTTE propaganda 
  failed thereafter. There were two main reasons for this. </span></font></p>

lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:

  some of the international NGOs that the government forces had been careful to 
  avoid civilian casualties, with the exception of about two lapses. The latter 
  seemed to refer to the bombing of Ariyalai East on the 26th October and the 
  two shells in Gurunagar on the 29th, suggesting again that they were looking 
  almost exclusively at the town area. The bombing and shelling elsewhere does 
  not seem to have featured significantly in their thinking. To this extent the 
  army and air force had been careful. On the other hand they seem to have had 
  the license to vent their anger anywhere, but sparing Jaffna town where the 
  refugees were once supposed to gather. This may satisfy foreigners, but it is 
  far from being a satisfactory approach towards the Tamil people who are citizens 
  of this country.</span></b></font></p>

  that its claims were found wanting in two respects. Although the LTTE under-estimated 
  its own power to force an exodus from Jaffna, the resistance of those who remained 
  had to be overcome by force and terror. (An LTTE functionary later confided 
  privately that they had under-estimated the panic that would result from the 
  announcement of the exodus order.) Despite the use of terror it took the LTTE 
  16 days to throw out those who remained and the truth came out very soon. The 
  figure of 500,000 refugees claimed for the exodus too raised scepticism. It 
  turned out that the Government Agent was quoting NGOs and the NGOs were quoting 
  the government administration that was under the GA. A figure of 300,000 may 
  have been more realistic since a steady exodus had been taking place for 5 years. 
  Moreover, the LTTE's conduct over the years had made the foreign media far less 
  sympathetic. Its spokesmen too cut little ice with the foreign media. </span></font></p>

  of a hundred Sinhalese civilians in the East. Had the LTTE not done this, the 
  100 or so Tamil civilians killed during October would have aroused greater concern. 
  As it was, it appeared as collateral damage that was light by the standards 
  of other wars. A veteran correspondent experienced in Vietnam and Cambodia remarked, 
  &quot;I hate to be the father of one of those killed. But look, what is a hundred 
  civilians dead given the heavy fighting involved?&quot; The indications are 
  that the death among combatants was about 1500 over the same period.</span></font></p>

  rather on the politics behind the civilian deaths. The death of even this relatively 
  small number of civilians cannot be attributed to collateral damage. It was 
  mainly callousness. Whether the number killed by the random shelling in Vadamaratchi 
  and Thenmaratchi is 2, 20 or 200 is not the question. The question is about 
  whether the Government should bomb or shell civilians at all in the manner it 
  had done? What is the politics behind such actions? Can it bring peace? Can 
  it reconcile the Tamils to accept living in a united Sri Lanka? These are long

  killings and massacres are integral to its workings as an institution and have 
  frightening implications. We need to use a different yardstick from foreign

  and the LTTE were playing identical games with the people and actually reinforcing 
  each other's actions. Both parties seemed most at ease in extreme polarised 
  positions, found in a state of confrontation and war. The government through 
  restrictions starved the people of cash. The LTTE did the same by withdrawing 
  its cash deposits from the banks and collecting for the National Defence Fund. 
  It then reaped thumping profits by exchanging cash for gold with desperate civilians 
  on highly advantageous terms. When the LTTE wanted to expel the civilians from 
  Jaffna, it looked to the government for some help in the form of shelling civilians. 
  But early November witnessed a lull in SL army shelling. The LTTE had to go 
  through the embarrassment of firing its own shells and getting caught. </span></font></p>

  wants the people to move to the Vanni, but appears to be hampered both by international 
  opinion and the tougher nature of the people in Vadamaratchi in engineering 
  a second exodus without help from the SL Army. The government appears to have 
  no clear policy. The army, it seemed, had acquired a taste for taking over an 
  area without the inconvenience of having civilians around. It would be more 
  convenient for the government if the LTTE could be blamed for chasing the civilians 
  out. Following its capture of Jaffna, the army continued to shell Vadamaratchi 
  and Thenmaratchi, but not heavily. In mid-December, however, the army announced 
  a heavy artillery barrage against LTTE targets in Vadamaratchi, claiming that 
  it was to prevent LTTE infiltration into Valikamam. Based on past experience, 
  one could have no illusions on what this means to the civilians. This made the 
  censorship then prevailing even more inexcusable. </span></font></p>

  He experienced bombing and shelling around Jaffna. But once the LTTE drove him 
  out, and made him a vagrant, his anger turned against the LTTE. In Vadamaratchi 
  or Thenmaratchi, he again experienced shelling. He under-went privations because 
  the government was made to appear responsible for starving him of cash and other 
  necessities. He came to Vavuniya to proceed to Colombo. He had to undergo the 
  humiliation of being herded and confined to a camp for three days by the government. 
  He came to Colombo to experience police harassment and fear. All around him 
  people were saying that it felt rather like July 1983. By this time, many in 
  his position would have concluded that the LTTE is something in the nature of 
  a necessary evil, that is the only check on the communalism of successive governments.</span></font></p>

  war crimes. We quote from a recent publication titled &quot;Post-Traumatic Responses 
  to Aerial Bombing&quot; by a medical don to appear in &quot;Social Science and 
  Medicine&quot;(UK): <b>&quot;In addition to detention, torture and displacement, 
  bombing [and shelling] is one of major stressors of the war. It would appear 
  that in many instances, bombings are used primarily as psychological weapons 
  against civilians, for their ability to accurately hit military targets within 
  densely populated areas is exceptional, as seen in the war in Sri Lanka where 
  the sophistication of instruments is low. At the same time, the guerillas have 
  consistently sought civilian cover, thereby drawing fire on to the general public. 
  The usually sudden, unexpected and unpredictable nature, the blast and noise 
  of the explosion giving rise to what was called 'shell-shock' in World War I; 
  and the massive destruction, injuries and death that follow are dimensions of 
  stress ...Thus the variety of symptoms and even the cluster of more severe symptoms 
  amounting to a psychiatric disorder in some individuals had been accepted as 
  an inevitable part of the war situation. It could also be true that many of 
  the responses to a traumatic experience are manifestations of an organism's 
  attempt to cope or adapt in an abnormal situation. Obviously what is abnormal 
  is the bombing itself and not the reactions to it. Lifton had stressed that 
  it is important not to delegitimise the suffering of the victims by assigning 
  a psychiatric label. Bombing of civilians should be considered a grave offence 
  - a war crime.&quot; </b><a href="#Top">[Top]</a><b> </b></span></font></p>

  This was largely the approach of the various peace missions, both foreign and 
  Southern. A confidence was expressed from within the Government negotiating 
  team that the LTTE leaders now reaching middle age and not far from old age 
  would like to settle down. The 40 year-old LTTE leader's son's being sent to 
  an elite mission school was deemed a healthy sign. In other words they understood

  become morally compromised. They had a contempt for those who raised questions 
  of human rights and morality and suffered for it. They believed that they were 
  doing the rational thing that was the need of the hour. Whatever compromise 
  they made, they argued, it was to keep institutions going and to preserve the 
  foundations for the future. What was happening to the people for whom these

  mausolea - the LTTE built in the Neervely, Urumpirai and Kondavil areas which 
  fell to the government forces within a month are a testimony to the magnitude

  discovered overnight that they did not matter a hoot to the LTTE. They were 
  thrown out of Jaffna along with the ordinary people and the institutions which 
  they sought to preserve ceased to exist. The nation was on the roads, rain and 
  all. But they were so cornered that even at this juncture they could not move 
  to represent the concerns of the people. Although privately expressing bitterness 
  against the LTTE, publicly they signed petitions to the international community 
  blaming it all on the Government. Although the relatively low death toll and 
  the recent massacres of Sinhalese diluted their case, expressions were used 
  giving the sense that the Government of Sri Lanka which had killed thousands 
  of Tamil civilians [in the past], was now [through forcing them out of Jaffna 
  under conditions of inclement weather and utter want], finally destroying them

  Cost of the Exodus</span></a></font></h3>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:
12.0pt;'><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">The one ddefence 
  of the enforced exodus that is also advocated by the LTTE statement quoted earlier 
  is that it saved human lives, in view of the looming military confrontation. 
  However, temporary displacement from directly endangered areas could have been 
  best left to the judgement of the people who are themselves well experienced 
  in such matters. Even if the claim to saving lives is valid, it is so only in 
  the context of the perverse nature of the LTTE's insistence of turning Jaffna 
  into a battle zone and the paralysis it has brought on the civil society. Having 
  decided on reverting to guerilla warfare, if it had concern for the people, 
  it had no reason to bring death and destruction on the people and their institutions 
  by confronting an army in the city for the second time in eight years. (Many 
  national armies avoid confronting an invading army in cities for the sake of 
  the people and to protect their cultural treasures and institutions.) If there 
  was moreover a functioning civil society with teachers, professionals and religious 
  leaders who could voice the concerns of the people independently, their demands 
  would have had a global audience. Then pressure would have been brought to bear 
  and their security far better ensured with the ICRC playing a more active and 
  positive role. The Government would not have got away with the kind of bombing 
  and shelling it has indulged in. Instead of credible voices on behalf of the 
  people, we have statements from bishops, vicars-general and academics that are 
  so one-sided that no one takes them seriously except expatriate Tamil nationalists.</font></p>

lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.1pt;'>The rootss of the exodus must be sought in the character of the LTTE's 
  politics, its unchanging agenda of totalitarian power, its absence of concern 
  for the people, and its duplicity resulting from a historical inability to negotiate 
  as part of a political process. </span></font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:

lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.1pt;'>It must aalso be pointed out that the physical death toll from the exodus 
  is high, beginning with a dozen or two who died in the same night as the direct 
  result of conditions in the march. We do not exactly know how many patients 
  shifted from the hospital died as a result, or how many sickly persons succumbed 
  (some conservative estimates have been given at the beginning of this report, 
  based on available information). Moreover, tens of thousands of animals succumbed 
  to an agonising death through starvation.</span></font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:
12.0pt;'><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">Death froom disease 
  arising as a direct consequence of the exodus is certainly high. Approximately 
  ten persons from Thenmaratchi and 5 persons from Vadamaratchi were dying daily 
  as the result of malnutrition, debility, weakness and diarrhoea that were endemic 
  among the displaced children. This alone would make the LTTE claim of life-saving 
  very dubious. There was also the accidental explosion of an ammunition truck 
  in Chavakacheri during November which was then crowded with refugees. According 
  to medical authorities, thirty six, including 14 civilians, were killed and 
  many others injured. Such hazards were greatly increased by the exodus.</font></p>

lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.1pt;'>What is pperhaps the key point here is that physical death that is readily 
  recognisable is just one way of ceasing to be. Other forms of death that are 
  at least as serious are far less easily recognised. In this second manner, the 
  community has suffered grievously and, perhaps, permanently. Each man or woman 
  is organically linked by deeply felt bonds to his or her home, the soil, the 
  environment, the domestic animals, educational institutions, and to institutions 
  of culture and religion. It is for this reason that the Muslims forced out of 
  Jaffna five years ago have resisted resettlement elsewhere and still want to 
  come back; it is not merely for a small plot of dry land and the walls of a 
  looted home. These institutions are the lifeblood of the community, built through 
  generations of labour, and represent an extension of the life of those long 
  gone.</span></font></p>

  out of Jaffna. The conditions and rigours of the march made people feel humiliated 
  and robbed them of their self-esteem. They also lost their sense of identity 
  as their homes, schools and the university ceased to be and they became vagrants 
  and beggars on the streets.</span></font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:

  of the exodus described in dramatic detail the stages by which they were destroyed 
  as persons and members of a community. In the milling crowd each person high 
  or low was a nobody. No one cared about women, children or the sick. It was 
  a struggle to take just one step in several minutes. Each move hurt or toppled 
  someone else. Everyone was a curse to his or her neighbour. Everyone was scarred 
  by the terrible experience. Life in the conditions of Thenmaratchi only reinforced 
  it. At the end of it many felt empty as though they had lost an important part 
  of their self.</font></p>

  about equal access to educational opportunities. It was never a struggle to 
  dismantle our educational infrastructure and go into the jungles. Even LTTE

  100 Sinhalese were massacred by the LTTE in October, a Tamil politician based 
  in Colombo who was interviewed suggested that the massacres could have been 
  done by other Tamil groups to discredit the LTTE. In the case of the recent 
  exodus, there were correspondents' reports translated and broadcast over BBC(T) 
  which spoke of the exodus having been engineered by the LTTE. But in a series

  Valikamam folk going to Vadamaratchi were taken aback to find many of the Vadamaratchi 
  folk defending the LTTE. Again the sympathy many Tamils in Colombo feel for 
  the LTTE is governed by a consciousness of alienation in the South that is oblivious 
  to the experience of the people in the North-East.</span></font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:

  brings out again the atomisation and leaderlessness brought about by the bankruptcy 
  of Tamil nationalism. For most people the focal points of community life and 
  leadership had either lapsed or been destroyed. When the LTTE ordered the people 
  to go, most had to decide for themselves and their family. </font></p>

  of a community and the fate of a city seemed to rest on the exhausted shoulders 
  of a handful of medical staff tired in body and mind. Having endured much, they 
  failed, and had they resisted then, they would very likely have failed the next 
  time or the time after. The episode, while bringing out human weaknesses, also 
  brought out strengths. It ended very much like many battles of a handful of 
  individuals against a determined totalitarian force. Yet it is an event that 
  we ought to be proud of. It demonstrated human potential and the spirit to organise 
  around a common cause and resist. It showed that the Tamils had not caved in 
  to totalitarian domination, but could act independently.</span></font></p>

lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.1pt;'>It is nott these doctors and consultants who are on the dock, but the 
  Tamil community itself, the expatriates, the elite and the more than 4,000 doctors 
  the community has produced since 1960. How did we come to allow a political 
  drift where it fell to a handful of doctors to take some momentous decisions 
  on behalf of the entire community? The catastrophe had after all been in the 
  making for decades. Moreover, of the thousands of doctors the community produced, 
  only a handful were willing to work in Jaffna. They had also spurned the option 
  of leaving Jaffna with dignity some months ago. What have these hundreds of 
  expatriate Tamil doctors who support the LTTE done to make the lot of their 
  colleagues who remain easier and more dignified?</span></font></p>

lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:

  leaders. These neither address the people nor reflect their experience. They 
  rather address the LTTE versions and the LTTE's concerns to the international 
  community. They have therefore nothing to offer the people in the way of leadership. 
  Their actions are rather a betrayal of the people.</span></font></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:
12.0pt;'><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">There is again no 
  leadership being offered to the Tamils whether in journalism, broadcasting or 
  in parliamentary politics. They, the practitioners of these, do not address 
  specific concerns in a convincing manner where the Government would have an 
  interest in listening to them. Their general refrain to stop the war and resume 
  talks with the LTTE makes no practical sense since the LTTE is yet to demonstrate 
  that it seeks political accommodation and permanent peace. This is only a way 
  of playing safe with the LTTE on the one hand, and on the other, in the event 
  of the LTTE being destroyed, to play the same nationalist card saying that it 
  was not they who betrayed the LTTE!</font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:

lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.1pt;'>All this is troubling particularly because of the absence of a clear policy 
  on the part of the Government on being accountable to the Tamil civilians. Reports 
  of bombing and shelling well outside combat areas are being angrily denied and 
  censored. If this direction is not changed, worse may come and alienate the 
  Government further from the Tamil people.</span></font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:
12.0pt;'><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">Meanwhilee the LTTE 
  Leader has in his National Heroes' Day address in late November asserted that 
  the people left Jaffna of their own free will, and that he would not talk to 
  the Government as long as the SL Army is in Jaffna. For the first time he has 
  personally made a claim in stark contrast to the people's experience. He has 
  both cornered himself and put a further distance between himself and the people. 
  It also faces those who would like to return to Jaffna with unpleasant choices, 
  while the LTTE blows more bubbles of illusion in the Vanni and prolongs the 
  suffering. It would save the Tamils a great deal of tragedy and loss if the 
  LTTE could be brought into a critical process of questioning by all concerned 
  Tamils, and made accountable as well responsive to the wishes of the people. 
  However because of the LTTE's absolute command structure, the supremo Veluppillai 
  Prabakaran may remain isolated from these avenues of influence and pressure.

lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.1pt;'>This placces a great burden on the Tamils living here and abroad, to recognise 
  that the community, particularly at home, is leaderless and in grave danger, 
  and to act with a sense of responsibility. Even at this late stage we have to 
  question our politics of death -the death of people, with so called martyrs 
  and traitors, and of children used in bearing arms or used as instruments of 
  terror. In the Exodus we have an experience where the truth according to the 
  rulers is in sharp contrast to the testimony of hundreds of thousands of people. 
  The LTTE's claim to protect what those in Jaffna valued most - their education 
  and their infrastructure so painfully built up - has been laid bare after this 
  exodus. We need to ask, what is the politics behind this and what does it mean 
  for us? Is it possible to sustain a society and a civilisation through sheer 
  manipulation without an underpinning moral commitment? <a href="#Top">[Top]</a></span></font></p>
