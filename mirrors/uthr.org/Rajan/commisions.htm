  Sri Lanka's Human Rights Conundrum</b> <span
lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt;
'></span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'>A current novelty in Sri Lanka 
  is the functioning of a number of commissions looking into past violations of 
  human rights by the State. These commissions, while raising eyebrows among the 
  ruling class, are slowly but surely unravelling the ramifications of state terror, 
  stretching down from the political establishment into the armed forces and the 
  underworld. Given the current global circumstances and economic mores that effectively 
  turn a blind eye to large scale violations, the role of such commissions is 
  not as yet clearly defined. In Britain the report of the Scott inquiry, which 
  commenced in 1992 was recently released. The inquiry was into the government 
  breaking its own rules and supplying arms and lethal materials particularly 
  to Iraq, in the course of which the parliament and the public were deliberately 
  and systematically deceived. Some of the intense negotiations to arm Iraq which 
  included visits by ministers, had taken place in 1988 just about the time when 
  the regime of Sadam Hussain poison gassed Kurd villages, subjecting about 5000 
  civilians to an agonizing death. The Scott report while damning in its detail, 
  has been adequately vague in its judgements to enable government ministers to 
  make out that they had been cleared. The public however knows that something 
  despicable had been done by those in the government and that little is going 
  to change. That may be the end result of several of the commissions that are 
  functioning in this country. &quot;Being economical with the truth&quot; a phrase 
  from the testimony of a minister to the Scott inquiry is a quaint expression 
  bequeathed to the English language that is so reflective of the times. The actions 
  of the ministers were so normal that resignations, which a more honourable age 
  would have demanded, are today hardly expected. </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>Edward S. Herman, wrote in his essay, 'The Banality of Evil': &quot;Doing 
  terrible things in an organised and systematic way rests on 'normalization'...there 
  is usually a division of labour in doing and rationalizing the unthinkable, 
  with the direct brutalising and killings done by one set of individuals...&quot; 
  So deep is the crisis within the ruling class in Sri Lanka, it would appear 
  that even this division of labour appears to be blurred. Testimony being given 
  to the commissions now sitting suggest that some of the ministers at least in 
  the last UNP government, were themselves extremely close to the dire deeds and 
  bothered little about rationalization.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>Shortly after the change of government in 1994 a remarkable article by 
  a Senior Gazette Officer in the Police appeared in the Island of 5th September 
  1994. The facts themselves are not surprising, but what was remarkable that 
  they appeared in print. It read: &quot;...On the contrary the police hierarchy 
  held the murderers and miscreants in high esteem and granted rewards to many 
  top ranking DIGs and SPs from the Police Reward Fund from which they were not 
  entitled to receive any rewards. It was a normal occurrence in those ignoble 
  days[latter 80s] for certain DIGs and SPs who cowered before rank and riches 
  to do a pilgrimage to Police Headquarters daily in the morning and verbally 
  report to the IGP regarding the number of people killed, burnt, decapitated 
  or made to float down rivers... The hierarchy was so anxious to reward the Gestapo 
  leaders that one DIG, who made an application for a reward of Rs.200,000 at 
  9.00 a.m. on a given day, was awarded an enhanced reward of Rs.300,000 by the 
  Defence Ministry the same evening...</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>&quot;It is now generally conceded that it was a former President who 
  started the rot in the Police Service by rewarding those who flouted the law 
  openly. As a matter of fact at an open conference of high security personnel, 
  he said in response to a plea made by an army officer that they must make a 
  concerted effort to win the hearts and minds of the youth, that the security 
  personnel must first start doing that by 'crushing their balls'. Mr.R.Premadasa 
  continued this repugnant policy on an extended scale.&quot;</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>At present there are several commissions inquiring into different sets 
  of violations in which some senior security personnel had been implicated. One 
  commission is looking into the killing of General Kobbekkaduwa in a landmine 
  explosion in 1992, and another into the alleged plan to disrupt the parliamentary 
  elections held in August 1994. A truism uttered by Major General Lucky Algama 
  before the latter commission is that the proceedings before this commissions 
  would not have been there if not for the change of government. One commission 
  that has been very revealing is the Batalanda Commission. Among its tasks is 
  to probe the disappearance of police sub-Inspector Priyadarshana and several 
  allegations of torture and murder in a camp for which a house in the Fertiliser 
  Corporation housing complex at Batalanda is said to have been used. A reason 
  why this has attracted considerable interest is the occurrence of the name of 
  the UNP leader and former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe in this connection. 
  According to the testimony given before the commission so far the following 
  pattern has emerged regarding the events which took place between early 1988 
  and the end of 1991: </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'>The housing scheme came under 
  the purview of Ranil Wickremasinghe who was then Minister of Industries. A house 
  in the scheme about 100 yards from the alleged torture camp was used by him 
  and which he is said to have visited about once a week. The torture camp was 
  allegedly run by men from the CSU(Counter Subversive Unit) who were led by Douglas 
  Peiris, who during that period was promoted from IP to ASP, and recently when 
  he was interdicted held the rank of SSP. Douglas Peiris too lived in the housing 
  complex and a house according to a former chairman of the Fertiliser Corporation, 
  was allocated to him(Douglas) in June 1988 on instructions from Ranil Wickremasinghe. 
  On 20th February 1990(about the same time that journalist Richard De Soyza disappeared 
  in a separate incident) Sub-Inspector Priyadarshana was summoned through radio 
  by his superior Inspector Attapattu and was driven away in a vehicle after which 
  he was no longer seen alive. According to the testimony of his friends in the 
  Police and his father and brother, he had gone to Biyagama Village Inn where, 
  according to one of them, he is said to have met among others, Ranil Wickremasinghe 
  and Douglas Peiris. The issue is said to have been about Priyadarshana's non-compliance 
  with instructions on dealing with criminal elements close to the ruling party. 
  After Priyadarshana's disappearance his friends in the Police, his father and 
  brother are said to have been effectively warned in intimidating terms by Douglas 
  Peiris and DIG Merril Gunaratne that Priyadarshana was linked to the JVP and 
  they should not look for him. Although few would be surprised by what has transpired, 
  it is quite likely that the inquiry would be inconclusive and nothing would 
  be pinned on Ranil Wickremasinghe. Moreover in the prevailing political culture, 
  as an aspiring national leader, Ranil Wickremasinghe would be under little pressure 
  to prove his fitness for the highest office in the country by clearing himself 
  beyond reasonable doubt. </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'>The trail however stinks. Merril 
  Gunaratne has had some interesting associations which point to his having very 
  close links with leading members of the past UNP regime. During July 1994 he 
  was appointed as Coordinator of Operations in connection with the general and 
  presidential elections by President Wijetunge, when Ranil Wickremasinghe was 
  Prime Minister. It is in connection with this that he is appearing before the 
  commission looking into the 1994 general elections along with General Algama 
  who was then appointed Field Forces Commander. The association between Merril 
  Gunaratne and Ranil Wickremasinghe however surfaced earlier during late 1993. 
  This was during an operation which involved a large scale abduction of Tamils 
  in the course of which some bodies appeared in the Negombo area. A report in 
  the 'Counterpoint' of November 1993 had associated Merril Gunaratne with this 
  operation. Also used in the operation was a former PLOTE member Uma Prakash, 
  with some of his cadre who were brought down from Tamil Nadu after negotiations. 
  These according to the 'Counterpoint', involved Ranil Wickremasinghe then Prime 
  Minister, and Defence Secretary General Wanasinghe. Uma Prakash was gunned down 
  on 26th January 1994 near his headquarters in Wanawasala, Kelaniya, in Mr. Wickremasinghe's 
  electorate. A 'Special Correspondent' writing in the Sunday Island of 13th February 
  1994 also stated that Uma Prakash had been involved in discussions with the 
  'UNP hierarchy'. The report further stated that the killing of Uma Prakash was 
  done by a team led by Alavangu Dasan of the PLOTE, which was also working for 
  the government forces. These reports, as serious as they are, were never contradicted. 
  It seems hardly possible that the PLOTE could have murdered Uma Prakash without 
  the tacit approval of the government. Such were the times! There may be little 
  that is new in all these, particularly in the links of politics with crime. 
  Many of the activities being probed are linked to the JVP insurgency of the 
  latter 80s. However they also give us an insight into the machinery that was 
  responsible for the July '83 holocaust, which is yet to be probed and also impinges 
  on the ethnic problem. The inertia of the State is evidenced by the fact that 
  even after the change of government, Sri Lanka has one of the largest disappearance 
  rates in the world. </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>The Kobbekaduwa Commission</span></b><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt;
'></span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'>Testifying before this commission 
  Lieutenant Vishvakumar described how they had been involved in handing over 
  arms to the LTTE during the middle of 1989. This was when President Premadasa 
  was having talks with the LTTE which was fighting the Indian Peace Keeping Force. 
  The supply arms to the LTTE was well known at that time and was not seriously 
  disapproved of. In the South the LTTE were then spoken of as patriots fighting 
  the 'traditional enemy', India. That it should become an issue later reflects 
  the crisis ridden character of the ruling class and its fragility. It was during 
  1991 that the matter was raised as an issue in the face of the attempt to impeach 
  President Premadasa. The lieutenant's testimony too reflects the internal divisions, 
  fear and suspicion within the ruling class. The testimony had been videod in 
  the presence of General Kobbekaduwa, Lalith Athulathmudali and Gamini Dissanayake, 
  during late 1991. Thereafter the lieutenant underwent plastic surgery and lived 
  in fear for his life. His testimony also gives a hint of the complexity which 
  surrounded the violence at that time and the often contradictory and multiple 
  linkages of each actor. The lieutenant after having first contacted Athulathmudali 
  in March 1990 and then having told all to Athulathmudali and Kobbekaduwa in 
  late 1990 at Athulathmudali's residence, then went into hiding. At this stage 
  Athulathmudali was aiding him with money and had instructed him to call him 
  twice a week. While in hiding the lieutenant had contacted a police SI and ASP 
  Royce Fernando who was in the personal security service of Minister Joseph Michael 
  Perera. This minister unlike Athulathmudali remained, for whatever reason, on 
  President Premadasa's side during the attempt to impeach him. According to the 
  lieutenant Royce Fernando was linked to a death squad which included &quot;Angilikota 
  Nihal&quot; and Shelton Nonis. He also said that some persons were &quot;arrested&quot; 
  on the information given by him!</p>

<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>President Chandrika Kumaranatunge's election pledge to restore respect 
  for human rights and human dignity was one which gave her a resounding majority 
  of votes from the ordinary masses. The commissions had been moving slowly, and 
  her own credibility demanded that action should be taken to demonstrate her 
  commitment. On 11th January 1996 she sent a letter to the Army Commander ordering 
  him to place a number of officers who had been implicated in commission hearings 
  to be placed on compulsory leave. The Commander was ordered to report back in 
  a month. The list according to press reports included a number of brigadiers, 
  two of whom were involved in the operation to recapture the City of Jaffna, 
  and another implicated in the disappearance of school boys at Embilipitiya, 
  is also now posted in the North. Of the first two brigadiers one is implicated 
  in the killing of 20 youths at Nikkaravetiya army camp during 1989. Prior to 
  the incident the brigadier had called a meeting of civilians and said that ten 
  of them would be sacrificed for every soldier killed. The second brigadier is 
  implicated among others, in the disappearance of 158 civilians taken from the 
  Eastern University refugee camp during September 1990. Ironically he was serving 
  directly under the present Army Commander, then in charge of the East, who at 
  least contributed to the cover up. Not surprisingly nothing happened. The President's 
  order was effectively flouted. On 27th February, the existence of the order 
  was reported in the Island and was promptly denied by the Defence Ministry. 
  Subsequently a facsimile of the letter was published in the Sunday Leader. While 
  human rights groups were silent the mainline press which essentially represented 
  ruling class interests mounted a campaign representing the officers implicated 
  as heroes and patriots, if not for whom the war against the LTTE would be seriously 
  jeopardised. The government too evidently lacked the conviction to argue that 
  the methods of these officers had been in use for more than a dozen of years 
  while the country got deeper into crisis with imminent division. It remained 
  silent instead. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>Another event which is symbolic where the Tamils are concerned is to 
  do with the appearance in lakes around Colombo of more than 20 corpses of Tamils 
  about the middle of last year. The government to its credit ordered an investigation 
  and about 20 operatives mostly from the STF, were remanded. The Inspector General 
  of Police described in graphic detail where and how these killings were carried 
  out, on the basis of eye witness testimony and forensic evidence. However during 
  mid-February '96 the detained men made a plea for bail on the grounds that they 
  had been remanded for six months but had not been charged in courts so far. 
  The bail was granted. Thus in effect men who had been accused of a horrendous 
  crime could be released on bail while Tamils against whom there are only unsubstantiated 
  allegations, anonymous petitions or mere suspicion could be detained virtually 
  indefinitely. Although technical reasons could be given, this does not reflect 
  well on the government. Nor are operations in the war zones, especially bombing 
  and shelling, subject to accountability. During these civilians can be killed 
  by the dozens and even the deed officially denied. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>Thus on the whole the government's stated commitment to human rights 
  which ought to have given confidence to the aggrieved Tamil minority is yet 
  to bear fruit. The government's commitment too remains questionable. Against 
  this the fear psychosis and chauvinistic sentiment that is being built up through 
  the media in the South, and the LTTE's terror, the intention of which is to 
  provoke more of the former, appear to be turning the tide against the momentum 
  built up for peace. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>More disturbingly, partly owing to her failure to determine the trend 
  of events, the President too might give the appearance of being carried away. 
  In a recent television interview with Sidarth Bhatia of the Indian Business 
  Week she appeared to lump all Tamils as being supportive of the LTTE by remaining 
  silent. She further said: &quot;...The Sinhala people are going to get tired 
  very soon of getting attacked, the civilians being killed by the LTTE in their 
  villages, and the bombs going off like they did recently. There may not be any 
  stopping of the Sinhala people being persuaded into all kinds of physical attacks.&quot; 
  Given her consistent stand for public decency and human rights, this may be 
  taken as a note of despair. On the part of the Tamil elite, this has provided 
  ammunition for a new round of game playing bravado that does not help the ordinary 
  Tamil people any way. They would use this as a smokescreen to go on evading 
  facing up to what the lagacy of the LTTE's politics means to the Tamil community.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:

<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>One need not go very far to discover the dire problems faced by the ordinary 
  Tamils. One only needs to consult some of the recent lead items in the 'Island'. 
  The management is known to maintain a tight grip on the tone of the paper, where 
  articles demanding to know the supposedly mysterious problems of the Tamils 
  receive regular publicity. The management has also been implicated in lucrative 
  arms deals for the government forces. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>The lead item in the 'Island' of 19th February contains the following: 
  &quot;The forces launch artillery strikes in Valvettiturai[in the Vadamaratchi 
  sector of the Jaffna peninsula now having a large displaced population] very 
  so often. The forces are careful in attacking targets in Valvettiturai as <b>misguided 
  shells can hit places occupied by foreigners</b>[i.e., the ICRC and UNHCR and 
  MSF who are in Point Pedro 6 miles away from Valvettiturai]&quot;. In other 
  words the policy is, as not often stated so plainly, '<b>Don't worry too much 
  about hitting the Tamils but be careful of the Whites</b>.' In another front 
  page item in the same paper of 28th February, the same correspondent says: &quot;In 
  some areas the police had persuaded people not to keep outsiders. However senior 
  military officials believe troops and police hunting for under cover terrorist 
  operatives in the city would be able to do a better job if lodges are closed&quot;. 
  It is an admission of what has been claimed by Tamils, and others concerned, 
  for some time, that the police themselves have been behind a campaign telling 
  people in some areas not to rent out accommodation to Tamils or to entertain 
  Tamils. There are cases where even employers have been pulled up by the police 
  for employing Tamils. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>In this situation the Tamils are given an impossible choice between living 
  in the North-East and coming to Colombo. In the North-East they have to face 
  the callous manner in which the government forces are fighting the war on one 
  hand, and the LTTE's repression on the other. The South is again hostile to 
  them. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'>Some of those worst affected 
  are children who were brought to the South to escape prospective recruitment 
  by the LTTE. The pressure applied on Tamils in the South, the hate campaign 
  and ostracism, even tended to place a severe strain on Tamils from the North 
  and their very close relatives resident in Colombo. Children are often the most 
  frequent victims of such tense relationships. Some early surveys on affected 
  children do not augur well for the future of this country. Children as young 
  as 11 years old who were brought to Colombo and who understand very little about 
  politics have been found to obsessively insist that they go back to Jaffna. 
  When asked to draw their homes in Jaffna and Colombo, the drawings often reflect 
  the Jaffna house as homely and spacious with lush green surroundings, while 
  the house in Colombo is a drab characterless block. It does not take much to 
  see why the Tigers are so successful in this political environment.
