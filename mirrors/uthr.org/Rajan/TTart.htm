<p align=center style='text-align:right;line-height:12.0pt;
'><span> </span><b>- by Rajan Hoole</b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'>The eager return of large numbers 
  of civilians to Jaffna city and surroundings carries a simple message which 
  elite Tamil nationalists have found hard to swallow. Quite independently of 
  whether they trusted or did not trust the Sri Lankan army, they wanted to be 
  home. It was far from their considered wisdom to make a 'miraculous exodus' 
  to the Vanni, so as to make an ideological point for their 'Leaders'. Also increasingly 
  difficult to swallow has been the fact that the ordinary Tamil people desperately 
  wanted to give any prospect of an honourable peace a chance. Peace for them 
  was not a utopian nationalist programme in pursuit of which they were prepared 
  to throw away their children and those simple ordinary things that made life 
  worth living. It is also for peace with justice that the Sinhalese and Eastern 
  Tamils in particular voted resoundingly in 1994.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'>As to why this peace has eluded 
  us, we owe it to the people to examine the disproportionately influential role 
  exercised by the elite on their fate. The influence of the elite in imposing 
  or prolonging an unwanted war, including the conscription of children through 
  psychological pressure, has been employed without a sense of responsibility 
  and without having to face the consequences. Instead of trying understand the 
  totalatarian phenomenon the LTTE represents and its overall destructive impact 
  on the community, it has been portrayed as the protector of the Tamils. Its 
  failures have been explained away as mere `political mistakes' which are atttibutable 
  to the virulence of the `Sinhalsese State'. Moreover, their general failure 
  to tell the truth about its intrinsic nature, has served to confuse outsiders. 
  Within the community, it has helped to further repression and stifle dissent 
  in order to keep up appearances, and to deny the community all healthier options.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>Towards total internal censorship</span></b><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt;
'></span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'>As responsible agents for our 
  own community it is not our task to give trivial explanations for the LTTE phenomenon 
  by citing the flawed and even homicidal tendencies of the Sri Lankan state. 
  It is but for us to examine and determine our responses so as to build a society 
  that is stronger and fairer. It is the contrary that has taken place. Increasingly 
  the damage we have been doing to ourselves is qualitatively far greater than 
  the physical destruction caused by the Sri Lankan forces. To equate deprived 
  and suicidally motivated youth with the strength of the community is a piece 
  of tragic hypocrisy. A cause that is reasonable in itself needs no systematic 
  falsehood for its justification.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>The 'Tamil Voice', published by a group of well-placed Tamils in the 
  USA, in its issue of September 1990 led with the massacre of Muslims in two 
  Kattankudy mosques headlined, 'A Diabolical Conspiracy'. Calling the act 'cruel' 
  and 'dastardly' the TV fully exploited the Sri Lankan state's reputation for 
  skull-duggery, then at a peak, to cleverly argue that the killers were government 
  vigilante groups. But to the people of the area, both Muslims and Tamils, there 
  was never any doubt that the LTTE was responsible.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>Although massacres of Tamils by the Sri Lankan forces was shifting the 
  ground, there were then, in 1990, considerable reservations about the LTTE among 
  Tamil expatriates. In the same issue of Tamil Voice, Wakeley Paul excoriated 
  those Tamils &quot;who were tired and disillusioned [with the LTTE's responsibility 
  for the war] and would do anything for peace&quot;. These Tamils, said Paul, 
  accused other expatriates of &quot;needlessly fuelling the flames of violence&quot;, 
  and advocated that &quot;all patriotic expatriates must return and join the 
  fray&quot;. Paul answered the latter sensitive point by pointing to the role 
  of Western Jewry in the creation of Israel. He asked: &quot;Did those who fought 
  the battle for nationhood of Israel urge every Jew to return and join the struggle? 
  Or, did they instead seek the help of the rich and comfortable expatriates in 
  America and Europe to use their influence to get their governments to help create, 
  sustain and nurture them?...did they ask their expatriates to return[sic] to 
  Israel and crowd them out?... the expatriates can feed and strengthen the movement 
  while the locals fight [sic].&quot;</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>Only, alas, very few of the much abused locals had the choice to decide 
  whether to be in Wakeley Paul's position or in the position of those whom he 
  purported to `feed and strengthen'. Anyhow some sop was offered to those concerned 
  about the life and limb of fellow Tamils at home. The back cover of the issue 
  gave a US State Department number to ring and express their concern about the 
  action of the Sri Lankan forces. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>The true nature of what was being imposed on the hapless people at home 
  was however made clear by T.Balasingam writing in the Tamil Voice of Summer 
  1993: &quot;....all niceties of democratic discussion and relaxation of effort 
  would have been suicidal for them [the LTTE] and the Tamils for whom they fought. 
  Ruthless measures and even enforced sacrifices were considered necessary to 
  oppose Sinhala might. It was a case of 'all is fair in love and war' &quot;.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>Censorship today</span></b><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-family:"Times New Roman";letter-spacing:-.15pt;'></span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>What is perhaps most dangerous at this time is that for once when the 
  people returning to Jaffna have openly signalled their disillusionment with 
  our politics, the elite are largely governed by nationalist sentiment that has 
  proved so destructive. After 20 years of a liberation struggle, it is with a 
  sense of initial relief (an understatement perhaps) that large numbers of people 
  are returning to an area now under Sri Lankan army control. Instead of questioning 
  past assumptions, there is now a fairly noticeable tendency for Tamil intellectuals 
  to take refuge in further unreality. It is as if some invisible springs impel 
  us to think and act in an essentially dishonest manner.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'>For a good example of how large 
  numbers of leading Tamils are ensnared into dissembling, take the recent publication, 
  'Victims of War in Sri Lanka: A Quest for a Health Consensus'. The volume contained 
  papers presented at a London conference in which the Medical Institute of Tamils 
  (MIOT) was the main organiser. With the publication and release were associated 
  some of the most successful medical men among the Tamils, some of whom were 
  privately very critical of the LTTE. The editors named in the volume were outstanding 
  Tamil men in the medical profession.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'>The `Historical Background' 
  in the volume reads rather like the report, `the Massacre of civilians', presented 
  to parliament by the Deputy Minister for Defence last February. In the latter, 
  nearly all the 3000 or so victims referred to are Sinhalese, with no mention 
  of the tens of thousands of Tamil victims. In the former, for example, the 
  LTTE's brutal crackdown on fellow Tamil groups and civil society in 1986, accompanied 
  by half dead burning bodies at junctions and killing of prisoners, is glossed 
  over in the following terms: &quot; 1986: State repression and violence intensify 
  in the Tamil Homeland; all-out war between the Sri Lankan state and the Tamils. 
  LTTE emerges dominant among Tamil guerilla groups, and takes effective control 
  of Jaffna peninsula...&quot; Unlike the Deputy Defence Minister's, this account 
  comes from the ` healing profession' who generally subscribe to the cant that 
  they are `above politics'.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>A key paper in the volume dealt with what is perhaps the most serious 
  problem in the North-East: Victims of conflict related trauma. The author presented 
  several grievous examples of external violence, together with internal violence. 
  The latter raise some morally painful questions that are crucial for the community. 
  Of the two most telling cases, one dealt with a 12 year old, who was brainwashed 
  by the LTTE and sent to massacre people in presumably the Muslim village of 
  Eravur. The traumatised child recalled how he had smashed the head of an infant 
  and then stabbed the wailing mother. Another case dealt with a boy who was used 
  in torturing fellow Tamils. Both were in a state of utter breakdown. These cases 
  were either excised or rendered tame by the censor. In another place the reference 
  to 'Tiger militants' was changed to 'Tiger freedom fighters'. Now, I am prepared 
  to accept that the editors named are not responsible for this. But they should 
  have been more sharp as signs of manipulation were evident at the September 
  1994 conference itself. Finally, the 'Victims of war' have become secondary 
  to giving a facelift to a bankrupt cause. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>I could imagine that for the official editors of the volume to come out 
  into the open and say that they have been manipulated and used, is a decision 
  that requires considerable courage. If they do not do it and keep up appearances 
  instead, they effectively become part of the web. This gives a picture of how 
  large numbers of Tamils have got caught up in the LTTE web- a situation different 
  from 1990. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>In this context, one must understand how difficult it is for young school 
  children to say 'no' to LTTE recruiters giving them a distorted history and 
  confronting them with taunts to their self-respect. How distressing for teachers 
  and parish priests who know that within about two years, the child recruit would 
  come home a corpse for a cause it hardly understood- a cause from which the 
  elders maintain a safe distance after paying it lip-service? How agonising for 
  parents who often rushed to their children's school en-masse as soon as they 
  heard that LTTE recruiters had arrived? The parents often dragged their children 
  home or carried them on their shoulders. These were among the 'ruthless measures 
  and enforced sacrifices' required of the people at home so that they live out

<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>The recent peace talks (early 1995) under the PA government gave rise 
  to some responses from the Tamil elite ranging from Bishops to the professional 
  elite and scholars, who showed themselves to be very intelligent in a convoluted 
  way. To take one aspect, President Chandrika Kumaratunge's stated intention 
  of peace with a generous political solution went down well with the people. 
  The Government wanted the LTTE to agree to date for political talks. But the 
  LTTE without responding to that only wanted to talk about the flow of goods 
  into Jaffna. The LTTE's bizzare response to the call for political talks came 
  by proxy with remarkable uniformity from diverse sections of the elite: &quot;Instead 
  of trying to solve the problem, the Government is using Machiavellian schemes 
  to divide the Tamils from the Tigers. We want our fundamental rights (i.e. petrol, 
  diesel, cement etc.) before political rights&quot;. The simple fact that the 
  Government could hardly divide the Tamils from the Tiger leadership as long 
  as both were united in wanting the same thing, was disregarded. Once more war 
  was inflicted on the Tamil people.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>I have been associated with the report on the Jaffna Exodus of November-December 
  1995 by UTHR (Jaffna). Unlike in the case of prisoners held by the LTTE and 
  their gross mistreatment, there were hundreds of thousands of witnesses to the 
  events of the Exodus. Yet our report was so unpalatable to many elite Tamils 
  outside Jaffna, that they, along with the LTTE leader, opted for the big lie. 
  Quite often those who arrived in Colombo after the gruelling exodus, found themselves 
  snubbed as soon as they began to talk about their experience. No Tamil or Tamil 
  backed paper published in Colombo came anywhere near the truth about the Exodus, 
  despite their pretensions to reflect Tamil interests.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>Another event which should have shaken any residual complacency within 
  the Tamil establishment is also in danger of being swept under the carpet. This 
  pertains to the use of thuggery and intimidation to stop the publication of 
  the Toronto based 'Manchary'. Jeyaraj, the editor, wanted to maintain his reputation 
  as a professional journalist and publish a journal that would carry credibility 
  with a wide cross-section of readers. In the past he had bent over backwards 
  not to offend the LTTE. But even this would not satisfy the LTTE. Jeyaraj has 
  displayed immense courage in coming out with a public statement of the facts 
  of his persecution. Not surprisingly even the Tamil newspaper for which Jeyaraj 
  had worked in Colombo has not reported on his predicament. He is a rather lonely 
  man, who is likely to be snubbed by Tamil editors and intellectuals as were 
  the victims of the Jaffna Exodus. On the other hand the experience of the Sinhalese 
  of the politics of their own elite has many similarities with that of Tamils.</span></p>

'></span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>A salient feature of the crisis in this country is that the same Sinhalese 
  elite outlook that regarded ordinary Tamils with contempt, when challenged, 
  treated the ordinary Sinhalese in the same manner. This was made clear during 
  the recent JVP uprising and in the tacit complicity of this class with the depraved 
  workings of the state security apparatus. The real issue for this class has 
  nothing primarily to do with Sinhalese or Tamils. It surfaces in the financial 
  columns under the euphemism 'economic freedom', as distinct from the 'economic 
  totalitarianism' of the Bandaranayake government of 1970-1977. Ethnic chauvinism 
  is a legitimising ideology which attempts to turn the ordinary Sinhalese people 
  into storm troopers and colonists to enforce the 'economic freedom' of this 
  class. In this light, it is not difficult to understand the hostility to any 
  real devolution of power that in general comes from the Sinhalese commercial 
  and professional classes, and the mainline press.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>Following the violence the ordinary Sinhalese masses had been through, 
  what they signalled by their vote for peace and human rights at the 1994 elections 
  was that they had grave doubts about this game. There was also a new openness 
  in trying to understand the Tamil problem. When the new PA Government went ahead 
  with judicial probes into past violations by the State, it was scorned by influential 
  sections of the mainline press joined by the present UNP leader. What has surfaced 
  over the years, together with recent commission hearings, strongly suggest that 
  his motives were far from being disinterested or impersonal.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>Even if only a fraction of the testimony given to the Batalanda and Athulathmudali 
  Murder commissions stand up to scrutiny, it would amount to a severe indictment 
  of the mainline media for passing over these dark deeds mostly in silence. These 
  characters with their roots in the world of crime and murder are often featured 
  by political columnists as partaking of a P.G.Wodehouse type comedy, thus glossing 
  over the underlying menace. It is revealing of the establishment of which the 
  mainline press is part. Concern even for the Sinhalese people is thus a sham.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'>The election of the government 
  led by Chandrika Kumaratunge was an opportunity not just for the ordinary Sinhalese, 
  but also for the Tamils. Not to achieve a great deal perhaps, but at least to 
  end the war, confine the security forces to barracks, to create conditions where 
  judicial hearings into past violations will have their full impact, and to 
  cut the ruling interests down to size. The government's sincerity is not a question 
  to be posed passively, but is rather to be affirmed through constant political 
  agitation.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>The priority for a responsible and benign Tamil leadership was to acknowledge 
  the common interest with the ordinary Sinhalese people, end the violence, and 
  act in a way to win their confidence and remove their doubts. But the suicide 
  attack on a naval ship and the killing of Gamini Dissanayake in late 1994 were 
  calculated to do the opposite, as was the recommencement of the war in April 
  1995, murder of Sinhalese villagers and attacks in Colombo. The initiative was 
  thus handed back to the discredited chauvinist establishment in Colombo and 
  the armed forces. The result was hurtful to the ordinary Tamils and Sinhalese 
  alike. It was not another 'mistake', it is but the stuff of the dominant streak 
  in Tamil politics.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><b><span></span>A moral crisis</b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>To those who may feel uncomfortable, I am addressing that aspect of matters 
  which we as Tamils are best able to determine. If we could change for the better, 
  that in itself would be a great step forward. We have reached a point where, 
  as far as the elite are concerned, everything about them reeks with falsehood. 
  Most of their actions speak of a dual agenda. There is no relation of truth 
  between positions addressed to different audiences. Most critically we have 
  reached a point where there is no trust. The sense of identity forged by the 
  experience of communal violence and discrimination is all but broken. This is 
  where our politics has brought us. Neither the church, the medical nor teaching 
  profession has come out honourably.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'>On the matter of trust, take 
  the Medical Institute of Tamils. The motivation was essentially good, and most 
  of the participants meant well. Doctors from the government service in this 
  country contributing scholarly papers to the September 1994 conference lent 
  it authority. But against their wishes or wisdom, and certainly to their embarrassment, 
  an ideological twist has been given to the conference by some in crucial positions 
  which defeats the purpose.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>This reflects insensitivity and untrustworthiness among friends and colleagues 
  at the highest levels of society. From one perspective, the young men with guns 
  did no more than carry the failings of their peers to an extreme. We need to 
  urgently ask what went wrong with us? The egoistic vanity of society at the 
  upper levels seems to accompany the physical destruction of the ordinary people.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>It is good to remind ourselves where we stand after 20 years of struggle. 
  Only a small proportion have succeeded in establishing themselves abroad as 
  secure expatriates. A much larger number , perhaps 30% of what would have been 
  the natural population of Jaffna, live as refugees in the West. A a few pursue 
  unscrupulous activities and many more are disillusioned and cynical about the 
  struggle and face a great deal of uncertainty. The uncertainty also leads to 
  ambivalence about desirability of peace at home. The bulk of the people at home 
  however are worn down and feel let down by everyone: For all the suffering imposed 
  on them, the end of the road for them, not just metaphorically, seems to be 
  to spend hours in a queue like beggars to receive rations from the Sri Lankan 
  Army. The only strength we now have to boast of seems to lie in one individual 
  leader, who insists that all others be weak and powerless. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>Thankfully, there are also many exceptions who, though part of our history, 
  have kept their values and sanity. Dr&amp;Dr(Mrs) Deivendran, both long serving 
  doctors in Jaffna, wrote these plaintive words recently to a Colombo paper from 
  their isolation in Pt Pedro:&quot;...it is heart breaking to see many valuable 
  lives on both sides of the great divide being lost in this war. This beautiful 
  country of ours has the resources necessary to be a paradise on earth for all 
  of us if we can get together...it appears that it is essential that a bridge 
  of understanding is immediately built between the Sinhalese, Tamils and Muslims...&quot;</span></p>
