<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>The first part of the chapter will give a sketch of the historical and 
  contextual setting. The final three sections will then go on to relate this 
  to the ongoing discussion on secessionism in general and about international 
  mechanisms aimed at giving realisation to self-determination in the context 
  of democracy and Human Rights.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'>In July 1983 President Jayawardene 
  of Sri Lanka and his government were implicated in the worst bout of communal 
  violence against the Tamils,which was followed by India covertly backing the 
  Tamil militancy. Arbitrary violence by the almost exclusively Sinhalese government 
  forces led to a mounting toll of massacres and disappearances of Tamil civilians 
  running into the thousands<sup>2</sup>. As a means of territorially marginalising 
  the Tamils, the government also took the first steps towards militarily-imposed 
  settlements of marginalised Sinhalese in predominantly Tamil areas,such as Manal 
  Aru (Weli Oya), along the lines of the trans-migration policies of the militarised 
  regime in Indonesia<sup>3</sup>. The regime in Colombo enjoyed very little sympathy 
  abroad and large sections of the Sinhalese watched with alarm as democratic 
  freedoms were trodden under and the country plunged headlong into militarisation 
  of its polity. By 1985 the legitimacy of the Tamil separatist cause stood at 
  its peak. </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>On the other hand Indian sponsorship of the militant movement had raised 
  a small guerilla force to an army of several battalions commanded by rival war-lords, 
  whom Indian state agencies hoped to play against one another. Any accountability 
  to the people largely disappeared. By early 1985 stories of widespread torture 
  and elimination of dissenters within the different militant groups began to 
  circulate widely. Although it was dissidents within the PLOTE(Peoples' Liberation 
  Organisation of Tamil Eelam) who went public by issuing a book, the problem 
  was endemic to other groups as well, notably TELO(Tamil Eelam Liberation Organisation) 
  and the LTTE(Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam). In May 1985, immediately following 
  the massacre by the Sri Lankan Army of about 70 Tamil civilians in the northern 
  coastal town of Valvettithurai, the LTTE leader's birth-place, the LTTE carried 
  out a massacre of over 150 mainly Buddhist pilgrims in the sacred city of Anuradhapura<sup>4</sup>.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>Although many Tamils rationalised this sensational act of murder of Sinhalese 
  civilians as an act of self-defence, an important threshold had been crossed. 
  A year later, in May 1986, the LTTE took advantage of a split in the leadership 
  of the fellow Tamil militant group TELO to launch an all-out attack on it. The 
  tactics employed were similar to those used in the Anuradhapura massacre - swift 
  and brutal - with no quarter given and no distinctions made. By the end of 1986, 
  the LTTE had made itself the sole militant group in the struggle,through a combination 
  of terror,cunning and murder.All other groups were then banned. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'>It had enhanced its prestige 
  by appealing to the authoritarian nationalism of the Tamil middle class and 
  representing itself as the only force that stood between the Tamils and an oppressive 
  Sri Lankan state. But its own history carried with it some debilitating liabilities. 
  Having lost the moral high-ground, many Tamils themselves became disillusioned, 
  questioning a liberation struggle that had modelled its actions on the chief 
  oppressor - the Sri Lankan Forces.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>Despite its prestige, the fear of public accountability that would accompany 
  any moves towards democratisation and a fear of its marginalisation in a political 
  arena ,have continued to be key elements in the conduct of the LTTE. The LTTE 
  felt impelled to represent any political settlement short of a separate Tamil 
  state as a betrayal of nationalist aspirations, and all contrary opinion as 
  treachery. Internal repression, attacks on free expression in matters of conscience, 
  any mobilisation of alternative opinion, on dissent in general and on human 
  rights activity that was non-sectarian, became in an important sense more fundamental 
  to the LTTE's struggle than its armed confrontations with the Indian and Sri 
  Lankan forces.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>Indeed the LTTE's armed struggle became conditional upon the complete 
  paralysis of civil society and the silencing, if not the complicity, of institutions 
  such as churches and centres of learning. The Tamils are a relatively small 
  community that is disillusioned. That is to say, they see little prospect of 
  the conflict coming to an end even if they do not always blame it on the LTTE. 
  The more privileged sections are all the time drifting towards the West as immigrants 
  or refugees. To sustain its armed struggle against a casualty rate of around 
  one to one the LTTE needs to aim its recruitment drive at the most vulnerable 
  sections of the populace using increasingly dubious methods<sup>5</sup>. This 
  means that a large section of the recruits are children and young women from 
  the poorer sections. It is only in a society that has been rendered inert through 
  terror, where nationalist bravado has obliterated the conscience, that such 
  matters can go unchallenged. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'>Through the development of some 
  powerful external ramifications such as support mechanisms in the Tamil emigrant 
  diaspora and links with the global underworld of narcotics and arms, the LTTE 
  aquired a staying power to which the consent of the people was marginal. But 
  the demands of its brand of politics and violence imposed on Tamil society a 
  destructive burden. Among the most reprehensible and damaging to the Tamils 
  are the massacres particularly by the LTTE of Muslim and Sinhalese civilians, 
  most of them poor, living in the North-East. It made it almost unthinkable for 
  the Muslims and Sinhalese to live in a Tamil dominated autonomous region unless 
  the Tamils could demonstrate having made a complete overhaul of their virulent 
  legacy.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'>The unruly rejection by the 
  LTTE of fairly promising attempts at political resolution in 1987, 1990 and 
  1994, and several of its other actions, are a clear demonstration of its inability 
  to find a niche within the existing regional order in which it could stabilise 
  itself. Among these are the use of suicide assassins strapped with explosives 
  to kill Rajiv Gandhi, a prime minister of India, in 1991, followed by killings 
  of several leading political figures in Ceylon. In so raising the stakes the 
  prospects for the survival of the Tamils as a people, who are now virtual prisoners 
  in their home territory, were correspondingly diminished. The relative ease 
  with which the LTTE could mobilise a significant section of the Tamil youth 
  to perform suicidal acts of sacrifice for the Leader, also symbolised the suicidal 
  desperation into which Tamil society had been cornered - a society distinguished 
  by widespread character break-down and mental trauma<sup>6</sup>. </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'>In turn ,the Sri Lankan state 
  brutalised by its own chauvinism and violence through much of the 80s, found 
  it almost beyond its capacity to deal with the phenomenon it had spawned. Its 
  own paranoia and violence further alienated the Tamils, giving substance to 
  the LTTE's image as their saviour. The resulting confusion was such that while 
  the workings of the tragedy defied comprehension, they continue to provide scope 
  for shortlived attempts at conflict - resolution. But for the peoples of Ceylon, 
  there lies only uncertainity ahead.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><b><u><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:

'></span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'>It is almost futile to draw 
  connections between present ethnic distributions and those of ancient times. 
  The same also applies to the linguistic map. The earliest Iron Age urban centres 
  in the whole of South India came into existence about the southern tip of the 
  Indian peninsula from about 900 BC, suggesting a link with East-West trade. 
  These centres were Anuradhapura ,which later emerged as the capital of Ceylon 
  ,and Madhurai in South India ,which emerged as the capital of Pandya. The Iron 
  Age people, perhaps the Nagas of the chronicles of Ancient Ceylon who were spread 
  out in several small kingdoms, are also associated with types of Iron Age urn 
  burials discovered in South India and Ceylon<sup>1</sup>.<b> </b>The historical 
  period beginning about 600 BC is associated with a stage of North Indian influence 
  where dynasties with northern antecedents were becoming influential in the South. 
  This is exemplified by various forms of the Vijaya myth in Ceylon and by the 
  journey to South India of Pandava Arjuna contained in the Mahabharatha legend 
  <sup>2</sup>. It was from this time that several major religious and cultural 
  influences came to southern India and Ceylon from the north in the form of Hinduism, 
  Buddhism and Jainism along with their sacred languages Sanskrit (for Hinduism, 
  Jainism and Mahayana Buddhism) and Pali (for Theravadha Buddhism)<sup>3</sup>. 
  The Nagas were among the early converts to Buddhism. The other important element

<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>These were roughly the antecedents of the people of Ceylon who evolved 
  over more than two millennia during which there had been a constant flow of 
  people and influences across the Palk Straits between South India and Ceylon. 
  There was much that remained common to her peoples. The old lived alongside 
  the new. Along with Buddhism and Brahminical rites there were also thriving 
  cults connected with the pre-historic territorial gods of South India and Ceylon 
  - eg. Kumara and Uppalavanna of the Sinhalese - connected with the 'Tinais' 
  of Sangam Tamil literature.(Tinais are types of region characterised as forest, 
  coastal, desert etc.)<sup>5</sup>.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'>As for the ancient linguistic 
  map, little could be said with certainty. The ancient inscriptions of Ceylon, 
  like those in South India, used for the most part the Brahmi script and were 
  based on North Indian languages (eg. Pali and Sanskrit) in which new religious 
  and cultural influences were being communicated. There were also in the inscriptions 
  influences that were distinctly southern. Inscriptions in Sinhalese, which had 
  a larger North Indian vocabulary than contemporary Tamil, began making their 
  appearance about the last quarter of the first millennium AD. There are no known 
  Tamil inscriptions in Ceylon dated before about the 10th century AD <sup>6</sup>. 
  But among the anthologies of Sangam Tamil verse compiled about the 1st or 2nd 
  century AD are listed compositions by poets who were almost certainly from Ceylon, 
  and whose names suggest that they belonged to the group referred to in the chronicles 
  as the Nagas <sup>7</sup>. Written records are therefore not a good guide to 
  the vernaculars in use at that time. Linguistic, cultural and religious pluralism 
  has very much been the norm throughout history <sup>8</sup>.<b> </b>The polity 
  was largely decentralised with Anuradhapura enjoying 'ritual sovereignty' over 
  the regional kingdoms <sup>9</sup>.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>There was particularly from about the 6th century AD a rising infusion 
  of South Indian mercenaries into Ceylon, often in support of rival claimants 
  to power. At the same time trade and cultural exchanges with South India also 
  flourished . The capitals of Ceylon, first Anuradhapura and later in the middle 
  ages Polonnaruwa, became cosmopolitan centres.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'>The Middle Ages saw the rise 
  of the Imperial Cholas of South India who directly ruled much of Ceylon for 
  a time and Ceylon getting further enmeshed in dynastic alliances encompassing 
  both sides of the Palk Straits. This period culminated in the rule of Parakramabahu 
  I (1153-86 AD) whose attempt to centralise power was as grandiose as it was 
  repressive. The resulting strain was a major cause of the collapse of Ceylon's 
  famed hydraulic civilisation, given its final blow by the South Indian adventurer 
  Kalinga Magha in 1215 AD<sup>10</sup>.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>It was after this event that the country underwent a gradual separation 
  into largely but not exclusively Tamil and Sinhalese speaking regions. The former 
  came to be comprised of the kingdom of Jaffna and a series of kingdoms or chieftaincies 
  known as Wanniates, ruled by Wanniars. Many among the latter may have originally 
  come from the ranks of South Indian mercenary chieftains. Some Wanniates were 
  small. But others like Panamkamam, Thampalakamam and Cottiar were rich and influential<sup>11</sup>. 
  </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>During Dutch colonial rule of the maritime regions, it divided its possessions 
  into three regions for the purpose of the administration of justice. The three 
  regions were broadly linguistic, two comprising the mid-west and south-east 
  where the chief vernacular was Sinhalese, and the other comprising the north 
  &amp; east where the chief vernacular was Tamil<sup>12</sup>. The latter was 
  composed of a number of Wanniates and the former kingdom of Jaffna. The British 
  replaced the Dutch as the colonial power in 1798 and by 1815 had brought the 
  whole island under their control. In the British Administration's Census of 
  1827 much of the Tamil speaking judicial region demarcated by the Dutch, with 
  Puttalam District excluded, appeared under the category of 'Malabar (Tamil) 
  Districts'. Eventually slight variations of this territory emerged as the Northern 
  and Eastern Provinces. To the British who introduced a highly centralised administration, 
  the boundaries of these provinces, though having some historical significance 
  as pertaining to the Wanniates, were largely administrative conveniences.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'>But as grievances began to take 
  shape in post-independence Ceylon, these boundaries also served to delimit emerging 
  identities. This is true of the North as well as of the Sinhalese South. History, 
  however tenuous, was also brought into support these distinctions. For, few, 
  if any, in this country could vouch for the distribution of their ancestors 
  a thousand years ago, except to say that a large section of them would have 
  been spread across South India. With the ethnic polarisation of post-independence 
  politics, the experience by the Tamils of discrimination, communal violence 
  and the resulting alienation from the state, its machinery and its forces, the 
  Northern and Eastern provinces assumed a particular significance for their identity, 
  and its political articulation. <b>[Population of Ceylon - see Note 13]</b></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>The development of the colonial economy resulted in several tensions 
  which should have been resolved by a unifying, forward looking and healthier 
  politics as happened to a more stable degree in India. But such a political 
  movement did not take shape in Ceylon.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'>It is well to recollect at this 
  point that there was no ethinic consciousness until quite late in the 19th century. 
  The British Administration's census of 1827 categorised people primarily under 
  caste labels and there was no overt reference to language. The population of 
  Batticaloa District for instance was divided into 23 caste groups. This was 
  a continuation of Dutch practice and was largely in keeping with the prevailing 
  sense of identity<sup>1</sup>. Kingship in Kandy for example had a crucial 
  caste qualification. For this reason the last few kings of Kandy, for a recent 
  example, had to be brought from South India along with their entourages. Following 
  their enthronement these Hindus had no trouble in also becoming protectors of 
  the Buddhist religion. The term 'Sinhalese kings' is a misnomer perpetuated 
  by modern history writing. It was in the census reports from 1871 that the 'nationality 
  of inhabitants' referred in part to language. Caste, though important, had ceased 
  to be an official category.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>The case of the Muslims who spoke Tamil remained a contentious issue. 
  Sir Ponnampalam Ramanathan , the Tamil representative on the Legislative Council, 
  maintained in the late 19th century that they were mainly Tamils in their origins. 
  This was strongly opposed by the articulate Moor commercial class in Colombo. 
  The latter had no links with the numerically large Muslim community in the Eastern 
  Province who were by local custom and even clan ties socially integrated among 
  the Tamils. The debate was partly about representation,that was then by appointment 
  and was communally based<sup>2</sup>. Again for this very reason (i.e. communal 
  representation) the Tamils had no sense of being a minority at that time and 
  this continued for some years even after the introduction of universal adult 
  franchise in 1931.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'>The census reports of 1901 and 
  1911 brought further refinements to the categories of nationality. The Tamils 
  were divided into Ceylon Tamils and Indian Tamils, the latter being mainly plantation 
  labour of recent Indian origin. The Sinhalese were divided into Kandyan and 
  Low-Country. One might sense that a mixture of British administrative practices, 
  the politics of power and therefore of representation, led to new perceptions 
  of identity for which no precedents existed in history. Some of these categories 
  had a historical foundation. The Kandyan Sinhalese for instance had maintained 
  their independence until 1815, and external elations with South India had been 
  crucial to the survival of the Kandyan Kingdom. The Kingdom of Jaffna, which 
  had close ties with Kandy, served as an outlet for Kandyan trade and an inlet 
  for Indian mercenaries. It was mainly with a view to breaking this that the 
  Portugese in 1619 took control of Jaffna<sup>3</sup>. The Kandyans thus had 
  reasons to feel some affinity to the Tamils of the North-East as compared with 
  the commercially ascendent Low-Country Sinhalese elite by whom they felt threatened.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>Until the second half of the 19th century was a time when language was 
  not a significant source of identity, Tamil having moreover been important in 
  view of the external relations crucial to the survival of the landlocked Kandyan 
  Kingdom. Moreover at popular level, the distinction between Hinduism and Buddhism 
  is very much blurred. Today's ethnic divisions would have been very alien to 
  people at that time.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'>Older generations of some Tamil 
  speaking communities in the East regarded the Kandyan king as their benefactor 
  and had no memory of traditional links with Jaffna. The effect of 20th century 
  nationalist politics was to destroy the older spirit of pluralism with numerous 
  local identities, and put in its place two or three new identities in conflict, 
  with numerous unresolved tensions within each.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>Official categorisation also forced many to adopt identities that were 
  never part of their consciousness. For just one instance, the large Roman Catholic 
  Karawe caste community on the west coast north of Colombo were mainly Tamil 
  speaking and those who were literate were generally literate in Tamil. But from 
  the 19th century they have appeared as Sinhalese in census reports<sup>4</sup>.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>The Kandyan Kingdom which had held out against colonial rule was conquered 
  by the British in 1815. This was followed by the rebellion of 1817-18. The Kandyan 
  chiefs who supported the British were rewarded and the others went into oblivion<sup>5</sup>. 
  The descendants of the former became in time a largely westernised elite to 
  whom fell the political leadership of the Kandyan Sinhalese in the 20th century. 
  With the demands of populist election politics from the 1930s, their own outlook 
  attained a nationalist and patriotic veneer. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>From the 1830s the British opened up large tracts of the Kandyan hill 
  country to coffee and later to tea plantations. To accomplish this they imported 
  South Indian labour along with elements of their social hierarchy to facilitate 
  control. Their conditions were such that large numbers of them died of disease 
  during transportation. After clearing the forest they formed the regimented 
  labour living on the plantations, separated from the native Kandyan Sinhalese. 
  The latter lived in villages, having lost some of their traditional commons 
  to the estates, both marginalised and neglected. Even when they were from the 
  service castes of not too distant Indian origins, and perhaps socially not very 
  different from the Tamil estate workers nearby, the developing political milieu 
  worked towards antagonism between them<sup>6</sup>.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>The colonial economic expansion also gave rise to a new class of Low-Country 
  Sinhalese entrepreneur. The latter, hailing from the maritime regions, and considerably 
  Westernised through 300 years of colonial rule under the Portuguese and Dutch 
  who preceded the British, were well placed to take advantage of opportunities 
  opened up to local capitalists by the plantation economy. Lacking previous experience 
  of colonial rule, the Kandyan land owning class were no match for them. Those 
  Kandyans who spent beyond their means and found themselves becoming indebted 
  to the new Low-Country Sinhalese capitalists, also started losing their mortgaged 
  property to them. At the end of the 19th century the resentment of the Kandyan 
  elite was directed very much towards the Low-Country Sinhalese rather than towards 
  plantation Tamils<sup>7</sup>. The Kandyan elite also formed an easy rapport 
  with high caste Northern Tamils. Their sense of linguistic identity was weak, 
  as compared with caste identity. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>By the end of the 19th century the Low-Country Sinhalese entrepreneurial 
  class which had spearheaded the Buddhist revival and had become a major voice 
  in politics, was becoming increasingly concerned about commercial rivalry, mainly 
  from the Indian &amp; Moor merchant class, which had no connection with plantation 
  labour. It had aquired its wealth chiefly through liquor renting, graphite mining 
  and plantations, but was largely cut out from the import-export trade in Colombo 
  which was dominated by Europeans &amp; Indians. This rivalry found expression 
  by invoking the supposed historical mission of Sinhalese of the 'Aryan race' 
  to preserve this land sacred to Buddhism. The two elements in this supposition 
  owed to selective readings of colonial scholarship. One was the discovery of 
  the Buddhist, Pali chronicle, the Mahavamsa, by Turnour, a British civil servant, 
  and its translation by him into English in the 1830s, and the other, a section 
  of linguistic scholars identifying Sinhalese as an Aryan language, akin to the 
  north Indian family as distinct from Tamil<sup>8</sup>.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'>Even at the outset this nationalism 
  had developed a tendency to turn against the minorities in general, who were 
  said to be interlopers making this land impure. Anagarika Dharmapala, an early 
  20th century 'Buddhist reformer' and a son of H.Don Carolis, a furniture merchant 
  in Colombo's commercial district, took objection to the Indian labour as representing 
  the lowest stratum of Indian society<sup>9</sup>.<b> </b>Rather than criticise 
  the British and the colonial order, the suppressed resentment was directed against 
  the victims of that order, who also became convenient scape goats.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>There was one side to Dharmapala's career that was reformist and helped 
  to mobilise anti-colonial sentiment. Yet the prejudices that were a reflection 
  of the vested interests of his class vitiated the implanting of a broadly national 
  spirit that could stand up to the colonial order. The direction of his politics 
  became thus anti-minority rather than anti-colonial. Although influential and 
  vocal, the main economic and social concerns of the Sinhalese elite were concentrated 
  around a few urban centres. They accumulated a good deal of property in rural 
  areas. But their politics was such that little was done for the upliftment of 
  the Sinhalese masses. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>The advocacy of millenarian Sinhalese-Buddhist ideology and a politics 
  based on it became an easy means for this class to bury tensions and contradictions 
  among the Sinhalese and keep their hold on political power. With the Donoughmore 
  reforms which in 1931 allowed Ceylon a large measure of self-government under 
  universal adult franchise, the populist appeal of this ideology gathered momentum, 
  and it tended to become increasingly communal. At this point the emerging Left 
  remained the only hope for leading the country out of the mire of communal politics.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'>An important event in the history 
  of the Tamils was the almost fortuitous arrival of American missionaries from 
  New England in Jaffna, in the year 1812. Although they had originally hoped 
  to work in Galle in the South, the security considerations of the British, who 
  were then at war with France, would only countenance their presence in out-of-the-way 
  Jaffna. The northern soil was soon deemed fruitful for missionary work. Among 
  the fruit of their labour was what emerged as Jaffna College, an institution 
  of tertiary education unique in its time, supported by a network of schools. 
  Along with this was the contribution to education by other missions (eg. Anglican 
  and Methodist) who also had similar institutions in other parts of the Island<sup>10</sup>. 
  The dry-zone environment in Jaffna also provided little opportunity for large 
  capital ventures and unlike the South, Jaffna did not produce a comparable entrepreneurial 
  class. Instead, education was pursued all-the-more assiduously, and advancement 
  sought in the teaching service, the professions and in the clerical services, 
  much of which counted as government service. The demand therefore grew and the 
  impetus given to education by American missionaries bore fruit far beyond their 
  area of concern, and indeed beyond Jaffna itself as teachers from Jaffna spread 
  to all parts of the country. It must be emphasised that the direct beneficiaries 
  of education were a small section of Jaffna society, where farming and related 
  trades continued to be the main economic activity. Except for the urban centres 
  of Batticaloa and Trincomalee, the whole of the East and the rural North continued 
  very backward to this day. </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'>The outcome of this was that 
  the Tamils in the North-East and the Muslims who formed large concentrations 
  in parts of this territory looked to Tamils in Jaffna for leadership. But their 
  economic interests largely rested with improvements to agriculture and not with 
  government jobs. In an earlier phase in the 1920s and 30s the politics of the 
  educated Jaffna youth as represented by the Youth Congress was inspired by the 
  Indian freedom struggle.It was forward looking in its ideals and left behind 
  a benign legacy.It had been the first political movement to demand independence 
  from Britain.The Youth Congress strongly held to the ideal of a united Ceylon.This 
  was most natural to an educated Jaffna man whose skills were then sought after 
  in all parts of the country.But as communalism gained in the South, this was 
  echoed by the formation of the Tamil Congress in the early 30s, whose appeal 
  again was populist and aimed at gaining power without a serious programme.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>We had noted above that until the coming of universal franchise in 1931 
  the Tamils had not seen themselves as a minority, but as one of the two main 
  communities in the Island. This perception explains in part why the pre-independence 
  Tamil Congress demand of 50-50 (or 50% representation for the minorities) did 
  not appear to it as being unreasonable.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>Just after independence in 1948, the Anglophile United National Party 
  government led by D.S. Senanayake moved to deprive the plantation Tamils of 
  their citizenship and then the vote. Although the Left opposed it and many Sinhalese 
  parliamentarians were uneasy, the Tamil Congress leadership was bought over 
  to support the exercise. The minorities then comprised about 30% of the population. 
  By depriving more than a third of them of the vote, the door was opened for 
  the worst forms of majoritarian populism<sup>11</sup>.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>This danger was seen by the dissenting section of the Tamil Congress 
  led by S.J.V.Chelvanayakam, who opposed the bills and went on to form the Federal 
  Party. The ease with which a government could legally deprive a section of the 
  minority of the vote was frightening. The Federal Party saw the protection of 
  the people of the North-East as lying in the creation of an autonomous Tamil 
  speaking region comprising the Northern and Eastern Provinces. Among the first 
  issues it raised was colonisation under the Gal Oya scheme, apart from legally 
  contesting the citizenship acts. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>There had been from the 1940s a general consensus that Tamil and Sinhalese 
  should jointly replace English as official languages. In 1956 S.W.R.D.Bandaranayake's 
  Sri Lanka Freedom Party captured power on the populist slogan of making Sinhalese 
  the sole official language within 24 hours. The Federal Party's original fears 
  seemed well-founded.</span></p>

-.15pt;'>The first attempt at apolitical resolution took the form of a pact negotiated 
  between Prime Minister Mr.Bandaranayake and Federal Party leader S.J.V. Chelvanayakam. 
  It envisaged Regional Councils where people of the North-East enjoyed considerable 
  autonomy, particularly in the matter of land settlement (colonisation). A pledge 
  was also given to look afresh at the question of Hill Country Tamils rendered 
  stateless by act of parliament in 1949. The pact was abrogated when J.R.Jayawardene 
  of the defeated UNP mounted an agitation by arousing Sinhalese fears.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>This was followed by the widespread communal violence of 1958 (the first 
  in the series having broken out in 1956 after Bandaranayake came to power) where 
  the Government for a time appeared unwilling to take strong measures to protect 
  the Tamils.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>An arrangement similar to the Bandaranayake-Chelvanayakam pact agreed 
  to between the Federal Party and the UNP government of 1965-70 led by Dudley 
  Senanayake was dropped by the latter without its being presented to parliament. 
  It had been campaigned against by Mrs.Bandaranayake's SLFP opposition and its 
  Left allies recently turned communal. The new 1972 republican constitution introduced 
  by Mrs.Bandaranayake's Left-alliance government of 1970-77 made no gesture towards 
  the Tamils. This had followed standardisation of university entrance marks introduced 
  the previous year. In response to an abusive campaign mounted by sections of 
  the Sinhalese elite, the government unilaterally raised the entrance marks for 
  applicants answering the examination in Tamil, particularly to the science based 
  courses<sup>1</sup>. The blow was mainly psychological, particularly to Tamils 
  in Jaffna, who were not more privileged than the Sinhalese elite in Colombo, 
  the prime movers and principal beneficiaries of language based preference. It 
  also drove home the message that the state was anti-minority in its workings 
  and could wield arbitrary power against them with impunity - a message rubbed 
  in again and again by bouts of communal violence where state complicity was 
  only too evident.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>An important event at this point was the birth of Bangaladesh in 1971 
  with the aid of Indian arms. Until this time the Tamils had not seriously entertained 
  the notion of seperation. Tamil secessionism was then very much a fringe movement 
  lead by figures such as Professor Suntheralingam, a minister in the first post 
  independece government which disenfranchised Tamils of Indian origin, and Navaratnam, 
  a former Federal Party MP. The mainstream Federal Party had until the 70s ridiculed 
  the idea. Bangaladesh breached a consensus that was part of the post-war world-order, 
  at least after the Indian partition. A former colony had been split and the 
  UN had accepted the fait accompli. Ceylon had also been caught on the wrong 
  footing vis a vis India by providing landing and refuelling facilities for Pakistani 
  air traffic between its then distinct halves. But this caused no permanent stain 
  owing to good personal relations between prime ministers Mrs.Bandaranayake and 
  Mrs.Gandhi, and their general concurrence on external policy. But, for the Federal 
  Party that was being largely disregarded and ridiculed by the United Front Government 
  then going through the motions of enacting a new republican constitution, it 
  was too good an opportunity to be missed in rallying the ebbing spirits of its 
  constituency. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>It held a rousing commemoration of the birth of Bangaladesh in the Jaffna 
  town hall. People began to dream of India carving out a new Tamil nation in 
  Ceylon. The nationalist youth turning to militancy thought on the basis that 
  like the Mukhti Bahini in East Pakistan, they would start a rebellion and set 
  the scene for Indian intervention. This remained part of their thinking into 
  the mid-80s. There were however Left groups who argued that inviting India into 
  this would be disastrous, and advocated instead alliances with like-mineded 
  political groups in the South.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>During the mid-70s the Federal Party merged with smaller nationalist 
  parties to form the Tamil United Liberation Front.In 1976 the TULF passed its 
  resolution to separate and establish the state of Eelam comprising the Northern 
  and Eastern provinces, which were regarded as forming the Tamil 'Homeland'. 
  The TULF as events unfolded, regarded this mainly as a vote-catching slogan 
  among Tamils, and, with the government, a bargaining position. With the death 
  of S.J.V.Chelvanayakam in March 1977, the leadership of the TULF passed onto 
  A.Amirthalingam.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>The impact of these developments on the Sinhalese psyche must also be 
  understood. Although being a majority in Ceylon, Sinhalese nationalist ideology 
  gave them the self-perception of a beleaguered minority - a people of the Aryan 
  race with a historic obligation to preserve this land sacred to Buddhism, threatened, 
  as it were, by a Tamil fifth column in this land and hordes of Dravidian and 
  Hindu Tamils not only in South India but also worldwide. This prception did 
  not allow them to deal with the minority question rationally. The drive to use 
  the state machinery to marginalise, outmanoeuvre and terrritorially outflank 
  the minorities was a natural outcome of this ideology. On both sides elite politics 
  was characterised by a strong element of destructive self-pity. Matters were 
  hardly helped by the rhetoric and bravado of Tamil-nationalist politics. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'>The UNP led by J.R.Jayawardene 
  won a landslide victory at the 1977 elections. During the 1977 communal violence 
  which followed the UNP's election victory, many among the instigators were UNP 
  figures.Movements sprang up encouraging Tamil victims of the 1977 communal violence 
  to settle in the North-East and secure the 'Tamil Homeland' against attempts 
  by the state to break it up through establishing colonies of Sinhalese poor. 
  The small militant movement began to make its presence felt through bank robberies, 
  bombing of a local passenger aircraft and selective assassinations, including 
  of politicians opposed to the TULF. </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'>Though the UNP had acknowledged 
  Tamil grievances in its 1977 election manifesto, its executive presidency introduced 
  in 1978 further centralised power. Its introduction of the Open Economy, with 
  high inflation, blatant corruption and labour unrest, led it to take refuge 
  increasingly in populist communalism and repressive measures.Among these were 
  the proscription of the Liberation Tigers law of May 1978 extended for a further 
  year in May 1979, and the Prevention of Terrorism Act of July 1979 and, later, 
  the new Emergency Regulations of June 1983 permitting the secret disposal of 
  bodies<sup>2</sup>. Tim Moore of the ICJ reported in June 1983 that from July 
  1979 until then 23 Tamils had died in Army or Police custody. This was a mere 
  rivulet that was soon to become a flood. The repressive laws were framed ostensibly 
  for use in Tamil areas, but with an eye to their future use in the restive South<sup>3</sup>.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'>One who very much symbolised 
  the lawlessness and anarchy of the UNP era under Jayewardene was Cyril Mathew, 
  a powerful member of the cabinet. He was notorious for his anti-Tamil rhetoric 
  and brashly placed himself in the vanguard of championing the Sinhalisation 
  of the Eastern Province through encroachments sponsored by his Ministry of Industries 
  and Scientific Affairs, ostensibly claiming to protect historic Buddhist sites. 
  Other means used were the introduction into Trincomalee in the East of industries 
  like Prima Flour Mills and state corporations where it was ensured that around 
  80% of those employed were Sinhalese<sup>4</sup>.<b> </b>JSS, the UNP trade 
  union Cyril Mathew built up had been identified with anti-Tamil violence in 
  July 1983, and earlier with goon squad activity against other older trade unions. 
  It is perhaps a matter for little surprise that Mathew came from the Salagama 
  caste, one that is self-conscious of its fairly recent South Indian origin. 
  Prime Minister S.W.R.D.Bandaranayake and President Jayewardene, both one time 
  champions of Sinhalese ideology, are also credited with not so distant South 
  Indian antecedents<sup>5</sup>.These are also examples of how tensions and myths 
  underlying the Sinhalese identity contributed obliquely to the violence through 
  a drive for over-determination of identity.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>The communal violence of July 1983 was qualitatively uprecedented, not 
  just in its severity, but also because the state was all-too-obviously and shamefully 
  involved. Among the events of that saga was the planned murder of 53 Tamil detainees 
  in Colombo's Welikade prison. Separation came to be seen by the Tamils not as 
  just necessary, but as also inevitable. India which had been looking askance 
  at the Jayawardene government's pro-Western stance became a major player and 
  began training the flood of recruits to several militant groups. The Jayawardene 
  government did not help matters when an Act proscribing secessionism threw the 
  TULF out of parliament and when ,later in 1983 ,the government went back on 
  the Indian brokered Annexure C proposals intended at bringing about a political 
  resolution. Instead the government went ahead with massive military preparations 
  with the creation of units whose speciality was terror. What followed has been 
  sketched out at the beginning<sup>6</sup>.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>A word must also be said here about the role of the Church. Under the 
  British Administration Protestant Christians had been privileged, and the churches 
  as a whole were influential. The non-Christian elite were largely products of 
  mission schools and, in 1959, over 60% of the university admissions were from 
  Grant-in-Aid Christian mission schools. Partly as a result of pressure from 
  the Buddhist establishment the bulk of these schools were taken over by the 
  government in 1961, through the stoppage of government funds and making the 
  charging of fees illegal.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>The Roman Catholic Church which has the largest number of Christians 
  had fought a strong rearguard action. The churches had to face a new reality 
  in which they had lost some of their prestige, but remained disproportionatly 
  influential. The following year there was a failed coup attempt against the 
  government of Mrs. Sirimavo Bandaranayake. The bulk of the armed forces top 
  brass implicated turned out to be Christians.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'>A strong tendency which then 
  took shape within the Church was to identify the Church as authentically nationalist 
  and to outwardly move away from colonial associations. An effect of this was 
  that many Sinhalese Christians identified with mainstream Sinhalese nationalism, 
  which was also then ideologically anti-Tamil. The result was polarisation within 
  the church, which increased as Tamil secessionism gained in momentum.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'>The Tamil section of the Church 
  which was proportionately larger among Tamils moved closer to Tamil nationalism 
  especially from the 70s. Today, influential sections of the mainline Tamil Church 
  in the North have ignored the moral questions and publicly support the LTTE. 
  Public positions taken are also not unmindful of the competition for foreign 
  funds for projects and relief in the war zone.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>Consequently, the Church's legacy and the demands of realpolitik have 
  taken away from its potential healing role, towards one, which, particularly 
  on the Tamil side, has exacerbated conflict.</span></p>

-.15pt;'>Among the most intractable problems one encounters in resolving the conflict 
  in the North-East is the question of the political status of land subject to 
  extensive demographic change through government policy. The problem is closely 
  linked to the one of clarifying the notions of 'Tamil Nation' and 'Tamil Homeland'. 
  These concepts came into political discourse as a reaction to state oppression 
  of the minorities and a commonly felt need to preserve identity. </span></p>

-.15pt;'>They drew further strength in response to communal violence where the 
  role of the state was far from creditable. Following every bout of violence 
  from 1958 Tamil refugees flocked to the Northern and Eastern provinces in search 
  of safety. This made state sponsored settlements of Sinhalese an even more contentious 
  issue.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>The present North-East is largely a conglomeration of the former Kingdom 
  of Jaffna and several semi-independent Wanniates or chiefdoms that were mostly 
  Tamil speaking. These reached their height of fame and prosperity between the 
  collapse of the hydraulic civilisation in the Middle Ages and about the early 
  part of the 16th century.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>A deterioration of conditions is the Wanniates concomitant with a declining 
  population is a part of the backdrop to today's problems. One cause is connected 
  with the difficulty of sustaining a population in the dry-zone, of which the 
  North-East is part, when the necessary social organization for it had broken 
  down, and the higher orders became merely exploitative while life became close 
  to unbearable for those at the bottom. This appears to have been the fate of 
  the Wanniates, as with the earlier hydraulic civilisaion. We have records of 
  the former prosperity of some of the Wanniates. Dutch colonial officials Van 
  Senden and Tornbauer have given us a graphic picture of their decline<sup>1</sup>. 
  The passage of colonial armies in the course of military expeditions also had 
  their destabilising effect. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'>By the early 19th century their 
  population was a shadow of what it would have been at the time of their prosperity. 
  Census reports bear testimony to the relative decline of the Tamil population 
  in the North-East. In the British Administration's 1827 census the Tamil population 
  of the North-East formed 17 to 20 %of the total Ceylon population <sup>2</sup>. 
  This had declined to 14% by 1901 (after accounting for emigration and the addition 
  of an India-born population to the Ceylon population). This trend is further 
  confirmed by a comparison of rates of natural increase in the wet and dry zones 
  in the early decades of this century<sup>3</sup>. In 1981 the Tamil population 
  in the North-East was 8.6% of the Ceylon population (although Tamils of North-East 
  origin formed 12.5%).</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'>The upshot of this was that 
  at the time of independence the Ceylon Tamils had cultural and religious associations 
  with much of the North-East, several areas of which had, although, become sparsely 
  populated. Under a unitary system of government elected by one man - one vote 
  universal franchise, the Tamils were neither allowed the organisation nor the 
  means to have a voice in the development of the North-East. </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'>From the 1940s the government 
  pursued with vigour the policy of restoring or constructing irrigation works 
  in the wet-zone and the planned migration of principally Sinhalese poor from 
  the more populous wet-zone districts into the dry-zone. This was ostensibly 
  meant to relieve landlessness among peasantry in the former. Enormous subsidies 
  were given at state expense. In the main the Gal Oya, Kanthalai and Allai schemes 
  had the effect of increasing the Sinhalese population in the Eastern Province 
  from about 5% in 1901 to 25% in 1981, the balance being 42% Tamil and 32% Muslim. 
  During bouts of communal violence the Tamils in colony areas were among the 
  most vulnerable, and were progressively pushed out from 1956. During the 80s 
  ,particularly in Trincomalee District, the almost totally Sinhalese armed forces 
  brazenly went about destroying property and depopulating several Tamil villages. 
  Trincomalee is the northernmost district of the Eastern Province and shares 
  a border with the Northern Province. The state machinery in general used all 
  possible means to boost the Sinhalese population in the East<sup>4</sup>.<b> 
  </b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>Whatever the original motivations had been for colonisation, by 1984 
  it had little to do with economic development or social upliftment. The Weli 
  Oya scheme was begun on the border of the Northern and Eastern provinces after 
  driving out the Tamil inhabitants in an undisguised act of state-terror. If 
  there was any doubt about the agenda earlier, it had now been made very clear. 
  This course was marked by a series of massacres of Tamils by government forces 
  and counter-massacres of Sinhalese, principally by the LTTE, in the border regions<sup>5</sup>.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>To understand graphically what colonisation in the East was all about, 
  the Sinhalese population in the Trincomalee District had increased from 4.3% 
  in 1901 to 33.6 in 1981, while the Tamil population over this period dropped 
  from 60% to 36.4%. The population density of Trincomalee District was 285 persons 
  per square mile in 1981 with ,56.6% of farming areas under irrigation. In the 
  neighbouring Sinhalese Districts of Polonnaruwa and Anuradhapura (whose combined 
  area is 4,008 sq. miles as against 1,048 in Trincomalee)the population density 
  was about 235 while the farming area under irrigation was over 90%. By comparison 
  the Kandyan Sinhalese District of Moneragala (2,719 sq. miles) with a density 
  of about 140 remained neglected. One of its main water resources, the Gal Oya 
  river, had been designated almost entirely for a huge colonisation scheme downstream 
  in the Eastern Province<sup>6</sup>.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>The 1994 parliamentary polls demonstrated that the combination of colonisation 
  and the electoral system could easily result in a scenario where the Tamils 
  may lose their representation in the critical Eastern districts of Trincomalee 
  and Amparai<sup>7</sup>.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>Under a healthier political dispensation where the state was non-sectarian 
  and there was adequate representation of regional interests, the mobility of 
  populations would have been natural and unobjectionable. But colonisation as 
  it was practised acquired an ideological thrust, where besides marginalisation 
  of the Tamils, associations with cultural and religious significance for them 
  were being obliterated overnight. What these policies have contributed to the 
  intractable nature of the current war could hardly be exaggerated. The stark 
  contrast between the long held belief in the Tamil character of the East, and 
  the actual position of the Tamils following colonisation and violent demographic 
  manipulation by the state, acted as the driving force behind Tamil secessionism 
  in the East. It was a reaction to despair.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>As for the impact of colonisation on the problems that it was meant to 
  ameliorate, we quote De Vroey and Shanmugaratnam &quot;:...as Sri Lanka approaches 
  the extensive margin of land for resettlement, the problem remains as intractable 
  as ever...The causes of rural poverty and landlessness are to be found in the 
  basically untransformed structures that have perpetuated underdevelopment...The 
  primary cause of the problem lies in the inability of Sri Lanka's economy to 
  generate a capitalist dynamic of industrial transformation. The strategy of 
  land settlement is not only a product but a victim of this incapacity which 
  is the final result of the political and economic actions of the class/classes 
  which wield power.&quot;</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>Dry zone land-settlement was to put it differently inspired by the class 
  interest of policy makers as a form of 'alternative land reform' which could 
  be used to 'avoid or postpone radical land reform' in wet-zone areas. Sinhalese 
  ideology was conveniently around as a serviceable means, and contributed its 
  own momentum to developments.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'>A reflection of the 'structures 
  perpetuating underdevelopment' is to be found in the number of schools by centre 
  in 1959 preparing candidates for science based courses at the University of 
  Ceylon<sup>9</sup> <b></b>: Colombo:54, Jaffna:29, Kandy:15, Galle:4. The 
  last represents the deep South that played a key role in the revival of Sinhalese 
  culture from the 19th century. After nearly 30 years of elected self-government 
  (from 1931) this was the sorry position of the South where huge resources had 
  been spent in turning people into dry-zone colonists. This region became the 
  heartland of the JVP-led Sinhalese youth rebellions of 1971 and 1987-89. The 
  colonies were not surprisingly places where the JVP recruited heavily <sup>10</sup>. 
  A further irony is that whenever the Sri Lankan Army advertises times and locations 
  for walk-in interviews to meet the demands of fighting the Tamil insurgency, 
  the colony areas feature prominently. </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'>Although there had been revival 
  activity led by the Sinhalese elite from the beginning of this century, of which 
  the Temperence Movement was part, the values promoted were essentially those 
  of an ordered society harking back to a reconstructed past. The conception of 
  Sinhalese society was mainly of an idyllic,rural and agrarian community, managed 
  benignly by their elite. The latter's political thinking was thus constrained 
  by existing colonial structures and consequently there was little interest in 
  motivating the Sinhalese towards a modern education. Post independence developments 
  are in part a crisis in this vision for Sinhalese society that was stubbornly 
  translated into colonisation schemes<sup>11</sup>. </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>It was thus to be expected that candidates from Colombo and Jaffna would 
  secure a disproportionate share of university places for science-based courses 
  according to merit. When 'standardisation' was introduced in 1971 to curb Tamil 
  entrants (who were mostly from Jaffna) by raising their entry mark, it was too 
  much to expect the ruling elite to admit their distorted vision of development 
  as being the main cause of blame. They instead resorted to vilifying the Tamils 
  as having acquired a privileged position by becoming tools of the supposed British 
  policy of 'divide et impera'. The fact that the American missionaries who came 
  to Jaffna in 1812 could hardly be regarded as advocates of pax Britannica had 
  ceased to matter.</span></p>

'></span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>The main weakness of Tamil nationalism stemmed from the fact that it 
  was based on the narrow interests of the educated middle class and was very 
  much geared towards preserving the influence it had acquired, chiefly in the 
  professions and in the public sector. It was when these were threatened that 
  federalism and secession came to be advocated. This was election politics with 
  no active party organisation to campaign on issues and mobilise people at grass-roots 
  level. It was literally conducted out of lawyers' chambers. The Federal Party 
  for instance could at best reach gentlemen's agreements with governments in 
  power through its Tamil elite representatives in Colombo. But it could not, 
  or would not, mobilise the people to mount a sustained protest to hold governments 
  to their promises. Tamil Congress, the pioneer nationalist party, hardly had 
  a base in the East which was largely rural. When the constitution for independent 
  Ceylon was being prepared by the British in 1945, the Congress did not ask for 
  federalism, but put forward the unreasonable demand of 50% representation for 
  the minorities who were then about 30% of the population. By 1949, in return 
  for cabinet office for its leader, it capitulated and went along with disenfranchising 
  Tamil labour of Indian origin.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>The Federal Party which replaced the Congress as the leading Tamil Party 
  projected at the beginning a greater sense of purpose, but carried the same 
  structural weaknesses as the Congress. Both its origins and articulation centred 
  around Tamil rights and Tamil consciousness. Its 'Satyagraha' protest of 1961 
  turned out to be a flash-in-the pan which it could not have sustained beyond 
  a few months. Its characteristic class perception underrated the masses as an 
  intelligent force, which if mobilised could sustain a long drawn-out struggle 
  on issues like colonisation. Likewise,the same class regarded the Sinhalese 
  masses with a mixture of contempt and arrogance, generally failing to identify 
  with their legitimate concerns or even to talk to them. The Sinhalese ruling 
  class was thus given a free hand in manipulating Sinhalese fears. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'>By July 1983 the politics of 
  the Federal Party/TULF stood largely discredited. It too had shown itself to 
  be capitulatory. Having done handsomely in the North-East at the 1977 elections 
  on a separatist platform, the TULF in 1981 agreed with President Jayawardene 
  on District Development Councils as a 'viable alternative to separation'. The 
  DDC elections in June 1981 were marked by a brazen attempt at vote rigging by 
  the government and by its armed forces burning the Jaffna Public Library. In 
  practice it turned out that DDCs were allowed no more than municipal council 
  powers. The TULF as it transpired had no strength at its command beyond its 
  misplaced trust in Jayewardene.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'>This weakness was already in 
  evidence from the 60s and the party was vulnerable to rational questioning 
  as well as electorally. This weakness was countered by taking refuge in Tamil 
  nationalist symbolism drawing on the supposed ancient martial glories of the 
  Tamils and going for stunts like signatures in blood. It was maintained that 
  the Tamils were weak because they were divided. By 1972, from Federal Party 
  platforms its parliamentary rivals (i.e. other Tamil politicians) were castigated 
  as traitors requiring dire punishment. Instead of examining its failures rationally, 
  a general mood was created where the ordinary Sinhalese masses were vilified 
  and the Sinhalese leaders represented uniformly as persons who make deals when 
  it is convenient only to break them. Nationalist politics had thus imbued the 
  Tamil people with a sense of powerlessness, an inability to see the potential 
  among ordinary people, and with a fatalistic sense that no non-violent protest 
  could succeed against the 'Sinhalese State'.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>Two concepts introduced into the political vocabulary by the Federal 
  Party are 'Tamil Homeland' and The Nation of Tamil Speaking Peoples'. There 
  was at least in intention a positive side to it. The Federal Party tried also 
  to bring the Muslims, an important segment of the population, particularly in 
  the Eastern Province, under the same umbrella. The move received significant 
  support from the Muslims who also shared Tamil concerns regarding the use of 
  the Tamil language and also state sponsored colonisation. But the Federal Party 
  lacked the mass mobilisation necessary for nation building,so as to motivate 
  people to accept differences, remove communal friction and yet bring a sense 
  of common identity. Once the Federal Party started taking refuge behind Tamil 
  nationalist symbolism and became increasingly intolerant of differences, one 
  could hardly blame the Muslims for not wanting to be a part of this movement.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>From the early 70s the course was set for the rise of a Tamil militant 
  movement.The 70s were also a period of political ferment when ideas were discussed 
  and debated by several political groups, many of them Left leaning and drawing 
  inspiration from liberation struggles elsewhere. A number of them firmly disavowed 
  communalism and tried to link up with likeminded groups in the South.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>The political and social climate created over decades by Tamil nationalist 
  politics was most conducive for an extreme nationalist militant group like the 
  LTTE. Its first acts were not surprisingly assassinations of parliamentary politicians 
  opposed to the TULF, whose ideological baggage it inherited. It too used the 
  castigation of its opponents as traitors with deadly effect to impose itself 
  as the sole group. It too lacked a vision of the potential of the people, whom 
  it required only as servants, blind recruits or as victims of the Sri Lankan 
  forces for its propaganda. The LTTE was also capitulationist in a most debilitating 
  sense. Its power ambitions were against the grain of reality. Every one of its 
  actions made the people increasingly powerless. Every time the moment of truth 
  arrived in the form of a cul-de-sac, the LTTE turned on the screws of repression 
  on the Tamil people, isolated them even further to close all openings and forced 
  them into a new and unwanted bout of war, only to postpone the day of reckoning, 
  while bringing nearer the prospect of the total destruction of Tamil society.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>To make matters clearer, from 1983 to 1987 the LTTE accepted Indian patronage 
  and trainig and went to the extent of boasting that it had become the means 
  for exercising Indian dominance over Sri Lanka, and had tried to sell itself 
  to the Indian authorities as the most reliable partner in comparison with other 
  Tamil groups under Indian patronage<sup>1</sup>. In June 1987 the Sri Lankan 
  forces were about to overcome the LTTE's last bastion in Jaffna, as had been 
  anticipated after the LTTE destroyed rival groups some months earlier. Instead 
  of supplying the LTTE with sophisticated weapons as the LTTE had wanted, India 
  imposed the Indo-Lanka Accord on both the government of the Jayewardene and 
  the LTTE. India then inducted its troops into the North-East as a peace-keeping 
  force, to the relief of the people. India had thus clearly demonstrated that 
  it was committed to the territorial intergrity of Ceylon and would not countenance 
  Tamil secession .It moreover stood for power sharing by all Tamil parties under 
  elections to be conducted for a newly formed North-East Provincial council. 
  India was not for a totalitarian LTTE regime,for its own purposes as well as 
  for sound democratic reasons. The LTTE formally accepted all this and even demanded 
  and obtained overwhelming influence in the Interim Council to be formed. But 
  in the meantime it launched attacks on other militant groups, instigated people 
  into provocative actions and engineered a war with the Indian Army. The people 
  suffered much from the wrath of the latter as well as from the LTTE creating 
  situations,such as at Jaffna hospital,where the LTTE provoked and ran away, 
  while the people suffered<sup>2</sup>. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>In 1989 the LTTE commenced formal talks with President Premadasa, who 
  had succeeded Jayewardene, with a view to bringing about the de-induction of 
  the Indian Army. Premadasa who was fighting the JVP insurrection in the Sinhalese 
  South was trying to ride a populist anti-India platform. During this time the 
  LTTE found common cause with Premadasa,as newly converted Sri Lankan patriots, 
  wanting the foreign army out. The LTTE was also supplied with weapons and logistics 
  by the Sri Lankan forces to attack the Indian Army and Tamil groups aligned 
  to them. In early 1990 LTTE spokesman Balasingham went on record saying that 
  the LTTE would lay down its arms once the last Indian soldier had quit, as happened 
  in March 1990. Premadasa too had meanwhile been talking in earnest about resolving 
  Tamil grievances such as colonisation. But in June 1990 the LTTE resumed the 
  war for spurious reasons. In the Eastern Province the LTTE surrounded the police 
  stations. The Government in the hope of talking matters out, ordered the policemen 
  to surrender without resistance. The LTTE massacred hundreds of the Sinhalese 
  and Muslims among the surrendered policemen and took to the jungles as the Sri 
  Lankan Army was ordered to move in. Over the next few months several thousands 
  of Eastern Tamils exposed to the wrath of the Sri Lankan forces were massacred,or 
  disappeared following detention<sup>3</sup>.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'>This is an extreme form of the 
  capitulationist politics of the TULF. The LTTE tried to get out of every cul-de-sac 
  natural to its politics by throwing in the Tamil people as sacrificial victims 
  used in propaganda, and gaining recruits through the anger and helplessness 
  of the people. The inclusion of Muslims, mostly from the East among the policemen 
  massacred was an unaccountable provocation. It pushed Tamil-Muslim relations 
  to new depths. In the short-term at least it helped the LTTE to gain recruits 
  among the Eastern Tamils. Many of them joined not to fight for liberation,but 
  to take reprisals against Muslims. The expulsion of Muslim residents from the 
  North and massacres of Muslims in the East are, in part at least, the LTTE adopting 
  a populist stance with regard to its Eastern recruits. The Government too had 
  played the game by recruiting Muslim home guards, arming them and thus equipping 
  them for reprisal violence against Tamils.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>The LTTE saw no contradiction in boasting themselves India's favourite 
  agents one day and then Sri Lankan patriots some months later, and likewise 
  changing its public sentiments from time to time. Several Tamil nationalists 
  have read into this history of totally unnecessary suffering imposed on the 
  Tamil people,a consistent stand by the LTTE for a separate state of Tamil Eelam. 
  The embitterment of relations with Muslims in particular,who shared the 'Tamil 
  Homeland',is hardly taken cognizance of by Tamil nationalists. Among the casualties 
  of this politics are the Tamil people and the conceptual viability of the Tamil 
  Homeland and Tamil Nation. If one is looking for consistency, there is certainly 
  a ruinous consistency in the methods congenital to this politics.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>In the light of a large number of secessionist movements springing up 
  in the post colonial world, there is an urgently perceived need to develop theoretical 
  and legal criteria,whereby claims to secession could be examined in the light 
  of international law, which recognizes the 'right to self-determination of peoples'. 
  The principle of self-determination of peoples first appeared in Articles 1 
  &amp; 55 of the UN Charter. This was generally interpreted as applying to people 
  in colonial situations. In 1966 the UN General Assembly adopted two Human Rights 
  covenants which were circulated for ratification among member states. Part I 
  of Article I which was common to both covenants - The International Covenant 
  on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) &amp; The International Covenant on Economic 
  and Social Rights (ICESR) - stated: &quot;All peoples have the right to <u>self-determination</u>. 
  By virtue of the right they freely determine their political status and freely 
  pursue their economic, social and cultural development&quot;. Martin Ennals<sup>1</sup> 
  said in this connection: &quot;The question must also inevitably be raised as 
  to why only people who are under colonial domination should be entitled to exercise 
  a right which is quite clearly stated as applying to all... Nowhere is there 
  a process for arbitration, no definition of terms, no UN body which will entertain 
  the complaints about self-determination as such. It is a right which creates 
  expectation without fulfilment. People are dying for a right which is known 
  to exist but nowhere is it defined&quot;.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>Lord Avebury<sup>2</sup> pointed to cases such as Eritrea and East Pakistan 
  (now Bangladesh) that cried out for international intervention on the basis 
  of the right to self-determination, but where much blood was spilt (over 30 
  years in the case of Eritrea) for the lack of such a process. One might add 
  East Timor and the Kurdish territories among those long in need of relief through 
  international processes that do not exist.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'>Lord Avebury goes on to suggest 
  that the UN should appoint a High Commissioner for Self-Determination &quot;charged 
  with the duty of examining all claims [in the first instance], rejecting only 
  those which in his or her opinion were manifestly frivolous or ill-founded. 
  The claims would then be analysed according to criteria specified by the General 
  Assembly, including: 1. Previous history of statehood or existence as a separate 
  territorial entity, 2.Geographical unity, 3.Ethnicity 4.Language, 5.Religion, 
  6.Culture, 7.Existence of separate institutions, 8.Evidence of will to separation....&quot;</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>We shall now briefly examine how the Tamil case stands in respect of 
  these criteria. The case of the Tamils could be said to satisfy 1. &amp; 2. 
  in the sense of separate territorial entity and geographical unity, although 
  claims to a previous history of statehood in the modern sense are weak. 4. &amp; 
  6. may be said to be largely true considering Tamils and Muslims as one group 
  in the North-East. In the case of 8. The TULF argued that the election results 
  of 1977 gave a mandate for separation considering the total percentage of votes 
  polled in the North-East. What happened was that the TULF polled over 70% of 
  the votes in the Northern Province, but the results in the East reflected the 
  effects of state sponsored colonisation of Sinhalese and the lack of conviction 
  among the majority of the Muslims and a significant section of the Tamils regarding 
  what the Tamil nationalist programme had to offer them. Interestingly, after 
  more than 15 years the LTTE too regarded the 1977 election results as a mandate 
  for separation, while also saying that it had punished TULF leader Amirthalingam 
  with death for 'betraying' this mandate and supporting semi-autonomous Provincial 
  Councils under the 1987 Indo-Lanka Accord.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>We encounter here significant difficulty in determining adequate criteria. 
  With a view to formulating a positive and workable doctrine on the right to 
  self-determination, without which 'it stood in danger of remaining a mere slogan', 
  Martin Ennals<sup>3</sup><b> </b>posed some questions, some of which in particular 
  are relevant to the Tamil case:</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>* How does self-determination relate to democracy when demographic composition 
  of an area has been changed?</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'>* Are there indications which 
  could provide early warnings of the need for preventive measures?</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>* How can self-determination enhance the implementation of Article 25 
  of the ICCPR that provides that &quot;every citizen shall have the right and 
  opportunity to take part in the conduct of public affairs, directly or indirectly 
  through freely chosen representatives...&quot;?</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>A crucial point made by Ennals is the linkage between Human Rights and 
  self-determination as envisaged in both Articles 1 &amp; 55 of the UN Charter. 
  The relevance of the questions would be evident from the sketch of the history 
  of the problem given earlier. We would in the sequel argue for the importance 
  of finding answers to the second question, which we believe should be key to 
  the general approach. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>It may be pointed out here that the concept of self-determination for 
  the Tamils had long guided the thinking of the Federal Party as well as counter-measures 
  taken by the Government of Ceylon (Sri Lanka). The first statement issued in 
  1949 when the Federal Party was formed, spoke of the unsuitability of the unitary 
  constitution and that the basic principles which the government had proclaimed 
  concerning the public good were 'pernicious and not suitable to ensuring the 
  unity of the country'. It added:</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'>&quot;We believe that the only 
  means of ensuring that the Tamils are guaranteed their freedom and self-respect 
  by law, and of solving their problems in a just and democratic manner is to 
  permit them to have their own autonomous state guaranteeing self-government 
  and self-determination for the Tamil nation in the country; and to work indefatiguably 
  to the attainment of this objective.&quot;<sup>4</sup></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>In this call for federalism, the concept of a Tamil Nation had been introduced 
  into the political vocabulary and the concept of a Homeland was implicit. The 
  tacit appeal to Articles 1 &amp; 55 of the UN Charter, with the linkage between 
  democracy and self-determination may also be noted. The immediate context of 
  this resolution was the disenfranchisement of Tamil plantation labour of recent 
  Indian origin. Federalism here was also mooted as a means of keeping the country 
  united.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>The threat posed to the integrity of the 'Tamil Homeland' by state sponsored 
  colonisation of Sinhalese was raised in a Federal Party statement of April 1951 
  in relation to the Gal Oya scheme in the Eastern Province. It spoke of the 'inalienable 
  right of the Tamil speaking people to the territories which they had been traditionally 
  occupying'.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>We note here the appearance of 'Tamil speaking people' in an early attempt 
  to include the Muslims as part of the 'Tamil Nation', who together with the 
  Tamils then comprised 95% of the Eastern Province population. In later statements 
  there was a vacillation between 'Tamil people' and 'Tamil speaking people'.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>Successive governments have publicly maintained that dry-zone colonisation 
  was non-partisan and was to do with development. A hint of what may have been 
  talked about in closed circles among those who decided policy is suggested by 
  a speech of D.S.Senanayake, the first prime minister of Ceylon, quoted from 
  memory by his grandson Davinda Senanayake. The speech is said to have been made 
  to the settlers at Padaviya, probably in 1951 or '52.:</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>&quot;Today you are brought here and given a plot of land. You have been 
  uprooted from your village. You are like a piece of driftwood in the ocean; 
  but remember that one day this whole country will look up to you. The final 
  battle for the Sinhala people will be fought on the plains of Padaviya.. Those 
  who are attempting to divide this country will have to reckon with you...&quot;<sup>5</sup></span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>Padaviya is close to the border of the Northern and Eastern Provinces. 
  The author of the book from which this quotation is taken belonged to a group 
  among the Sinhalese elite who were involved in the Weli Oya scheme of 1984 referred 
  to earlier, for which Padaviya acted as the spring board. this may suggest an 
  element of subjectivism in the grandson's memory. However the representation 
  of federalism as division of the country was made to the Sinhalese very early.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>The 1956 general elections which brought Mr.Bandaranayake's SLFP to power 
  on the slogan of 'Sinhala only', also established Mr.Chelvanayakam's Federal 
  Party as the leading Tamil Party. This was followed by communal violence in 
  the Gal Oya and Padaviya schemes on the borders of the Eastern Province. The 
  violence led by Sinhalese employees on the schemes led to the loss of Tamil 
  lives and the effective expulsion of many Tamils and Muslims from both schemes 
  which became almost total by 1990.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>The abrogated Bandaranayake-Chelvanayakam pact signed in 1957 had envisaged 
  the establishment of regional councils enjoying far-reaching powers in the matter 
  of colonisation which included selection of colonists as well as personnel to 
  be employed on the schemes. Then came the 1958 communal violence and the deterioration 
  continued.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>FP`s successor,the TULF's 1976 resolution for separation made reference 
  to the serious inroads made into the 'Tamil kingdom' by a 'system of planned 
  and state-aided colonisation and large-scale regularisation of recently encouraged 
  Sinhalese encroachments calculated to make the Tamils a minority in their own 
  homeland&quot;. It was then resolved that the [separate] state of &quot;Tamil 
  Eelam shall consist of the Northern and Eastern Provinces&quot;.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'>After the manner of professional 
  lawyers throwing in everything in support of the case for a Tamil Homeland, 
  there was in this resolution and in the 1977 election manifesto, implicit reference 
  to purported history in a colonial document - the Minute of Hugh Cleghorn - 
  prepared for the early British Administration about 1798 cited earlier. The 
  minute mainly dealt with administrative practices of the departing Dutch. We 
  had referred earlier to a region whose coastal limits were slightly larger than 
  the present Northern and Eastern Provinces where Tamil was then the main language 
  in use, which the Dutch had made a judicial region under the Commandant of Jaffna. 
  Cleghorn had mistakenly supposed that the judicial regions pertaining also 
  to a linguistic division had represented the homes of two different nations 
  from ancient times. The 1977 TULF manifesto presumably referring again to Cleghorn 
  claimed that the said region 'was firmly established as the exclusive homeland 
  of the Tamils'<sup>6</sup>.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>The case being made pertained to a modern problem. The tone of the last 
  two documents contrasted sharply with the moderation of the early Federal Party 
  documents. The new factor was the sense of frustration that had led to a militant 
  mood among Tamil youth and the beginnings of the militant movement, the nationalist 
  section of which the TULF was trying to hold under its umbrella. The 1976 resolution 
  for separation was passed in the last year of Chelvanayakam's life, when Amirthalingam 
  effectively wielded executive authority. When questioned by a worried senior 
  TULF politburo member based in Colombo, Amirthalingam had admitted that the 
  resolution to separate was in response to the militant mood of the youth, but 
  was essentially a bargaining position. Amirthalingam's style of politics and 
  what has been revealed subsequently indicate that his plan of action was to 
  use the strength of the Tamil case in international law and his influence over 
  the militant youth to negotiate a satisfactory settlement with the government. 
  The TULF believed it had a strong case in international law<sup>7</sup>.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>The UNP government of J.R.Jayawardene, partly in view of its own difficulties 
  in the South, decided upon a chauvinist course with respect to the Tamil problem. 
  The communal riots of 1977, 81, and 83 followed in quick succession leading 
  to the civil war. A course of repression was paralleled by a determination to 
  accelerate the obliteration of the TULF's case which appealed to international 
  law. The role played by senior officials in the Mahaveli Ministry in blatant 
  attempts at territorial and demographic manipulation, and their mind-set are 
  described in a colourful inside account<sup>8</sup>. This ministry which handled 
  the harnessing of the waters of Mahaveli river, and associated colonisation 
  schemes, was the largest recipient of foreign aid. It was along with the Military 
  the executor of the Weli Oya scheme. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'>For the first time in the mid-80s,senior 
  academics came into the fray to dispute Tamil homeland claims, particularly 
  in relation to the East. Some of the hyperbole in TULF documents was subjected 
  to minute analysis without reference to the context. Special units of the security 
  forces were sent to the East to foment violence between Muslims and Tamils<sup>9</sup>. 
  All this was accompanied by the use of the armed forces from 1983 in massive 
  repression which included killing, burning and disappearances.Home guard units 
  too were set up by arming Sinhalese villagers ostensibly for defence against 
  Tamil militant attacks.But the usual pattern was for home guards to stay out 
  of sight during such an attack ,and then take reprisals aginst the nearest Tamil 
  village.To both sides,the people,whether Sinhalese,Muslim or Tamil,became pawns. 
</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>These moves led to the eventual humiliation of the government while Tamil 
  society was itself being continuously destroyed by its internal politics which 
  made a parody of self-determination. The Indo-Lanka Accord of 1987 imposed on 
  the Government of Sri Lanka the merger of the Northern and Eastern Provinces 
  into the North-East Province, although, formally at least, the merger was subject 
  to a referendum in the East. This was a major concession to the Tamil homeland 
  idea. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>Today the LTTE argues its claims for secession on the basis of a large 
  extent of territory in the North which it had continuously controlled for several 
  years since 1990. It also tries to make mileage out of the mandate for separation 
  the TULF is said to have received in 1977. Where the LTTE is concerned, the 
  linkages between self-determination, Human Rights and democracy are,however,non-existent. 
  </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>Yet because of the intractable nature of the problem and the LTTE's ability 
  to frustrate any attempt at a solution that might make it accountable in the 
  long run, there have been several moves towards supposedly pragmatic solutions 
  that are prepared to overlook the crucial linkage with Human Rights altogether. 
  The choice was presented as being between subjecting the Tamils willy-nilly 
  to the LTTE, or a crushing military thrust by the Sri Lankan forces. Among the 
  advocates of such pragmatism or realpolitik one could list a number of NGOs 
  who receive their inspiration and funding from the West. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>From the experience of Ceylon and of the Tamils in particular,one is 
  confronted with the limitations of framing formal criteria for self-determination 
  and conducting the debate mainly in a legal framework. There are of course obvious 
  instances referred to where these may provide clear cut answers. Take the case 
  of the Tamils. Both the Tamil leaders and counter-measures of the successive 
  governments opposed to any form of self-determination to the Tamils were very 
  much guided by emerging interpretations of international law and by criteria 
  that were implicit or explicit.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'>Some of the questions posed 
  in the use of legalistic criteria have an element of artificiality. Take for 
  example: 'Do the peoples of Ceylon have separate histories or a common history?' 
  and 'Do all Tamil speakers (who comprise the majority in the North-East) form 
  one people or are they separate peoples? Do in particular Tamils and Muslims 
  constitute one people?' The answer to the first depends on what parts of history 
  one chooses to emphasise and how one interprets them. In the matter of whether 
  Tamils and Muslims constitute one people, Tamil nationalists would argue by 
  the linguistic criteria used to define Indian states.In the light of Tamil 
  militant violence against Muslims,this would be questionable . Take also for 
  example the suggestion that a UN Committee on Self-Determination should have 
  the power to conduct a referendum in the territory concerned. Given the prevailing 
  reality in the North-East Province, and the present atmosphere of terror, a 
  referendum would be a poor guide for making far-reaching decisions. </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'>Ceylon as one nation or separate 
  nations is not determined by ancient history but rather by what had been going 
  on in politics over the last few decades. A genuine process of nation building, 
  and bringing about a sense of togetherness with respect for pluralism, we know,is 
  a healthy process and one that would bring its own reward. But we know that 
  the Sinhalese elite polity failed in this matter. Again where the Tamils and 
  the Muslims in the North-East are concerned, a need was felt to bring about 
  a sense of togetherness as the 'Tamil speaking people(s)'. If Tamil politics 
  had led to a process where it was successfully carried out, that too would have 
  been healthy and would have aided the Tamil cause. But we do know that the process 
  was sundered mainly by the developing intolerance of Tamil nationalist ideology. 
  All these failures resulted in a severe deterioration in the quality of life 
  for people in this country as a whole. </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>We do know that from mid-1994 there were markedly healthy developments 
  among the ordinary Sinhalese people leading to a massive electoral mandate for 
  peace and Human Rights. There was a new sense of accommodativeness and a willingness 
  to understand the problems of the Tamils. The press too became much more open 
  in this respect. There was also then a large international presence in this 
  country that included aid agencies and NGOs. Did the attitudes of this community 
  make the ordinary Sinhalese feel rewarded and reassured?</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>Among the processes we are dealing with, the healthy ones are underpinned 
  by a respect for democracy, Human Rights and pluralism. A sense of a nation, 
  or of a people, are results of processes that cannot in the first instance be 
  defined legally. The most fruitful form of international intervention is to 
  encourage and reward processes that are healthy and to discourage others. This 
  we feel should be a main task of instruments appointed by the UN, which brings 
  us back to the earlier question of indicators and preventive measures. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:

  stateless) and depriving them of the vote</u>: Other than Idi Amin's Uganda 
  which deported persons of Indian origin in the early 70s (now rescinded),Ceylon 
  was the only former British colony to take such a harsh measure against arrivals 
  during the recent colonial period. The Federal Party in the early 50s took the 
  matter to the Privy Council in Britain. The FP argued that the parliament was 
  in violation of Section 29 of the constitution which forbade legislation that 
  was discriminatory to a community. The Privy Council upheld the government's 
  action on the grounds that the parliament of Ceylon had the right to define 
  citizenship, which the British framers of the Ceylon's constitution of 1948 
  had left conveniently undefined<sup>1</sup>. Had there been available an appeal 
  to an international body on the basis of the UN Charter of Human Rights, as 
  distinct from an interested party, that which was perhaps the key element in 
  Ceylon's tragedy would not have come about.</span></p>

  have been available some ready means of applying to an international body, which

<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>It is important that the structured scope of interventions should not 
  be confined to governments alone. Attention should be paid to dissenting voices 
  among aggrieved parties. The Federal Party's public display of intolerance in 
  1972, as evidenced by some of its popular spokesmen branding its Tamil opponents 
  as traitors,and leading to the first in a series of political assassinations 
  in 1975, should have been nipped in the bud. This tendency created the LTTE 
  and made many Tamils, and the Muslims as a whole, traitors by definition. The 
  FP/TULF should have been firmly told that such tendencies would impair the case 
  it was trying to make in international fora. </span></p>

lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt;
'></span></b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'>We come now to a suggestion 
  made in Jayawickrema's report of the Martin Ennals Memorial Symposium on Self-Determination<sup>1 
  </sup>: &quot;...it must be noted that it is the knowledge that the option 
  of secession is not available to the peoples who constitute a minority that 
  gives the dominant group the strength and ability to continue with impunity, 
  if it chooses to, its policies and programmes of oppression. But if international 
  law were to subordinate territorial integrity to the right of &quot;all peoples&quot; 
  to self-determination by recognising a principle that the members of a cohesive 
  social entity within a sovereign state are entitled to freely determine their 
  political status, the impact would be quite remarkable....The recognition of 
  such a principle will shift the focus from the rancorous assertion of rights 
  to the far more productive exercise of formulating the terms and conditions 
  of co-existence. A numerically small ethnic, religious or linguistic group, 
  conscious that it has the right to secede, will begin to examine the viability 
  of secession in political, social and, above all, economic terms. These considerations 
  will probably compel such a group to remain within the existing state, but on 
  terms negotiated by it with the dominant group.&quot;<sup>2</sup></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>Looking at this suggestion through the experience of Ceylon, one might 
  commend it as a general principle and the ICCPR too points towards it. It is 
  workable in the context of a democracy had the integrity and health of political 
  processes been preserved for several years. When a country is able to adopt 
  this suggestion as a working principle, it is a testimony to its strength. We 
  had earlier talked about the integrity of political processes through which 
  a sense of nationhood is attained or certain subgroups come together and acquire 
  a sense of being a people. Where the health and integrity of political processes 
  could be sustained, secession is likely to become superseded. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>But it is very doubtful if the adoption of such a principle would tackle 
  the immediate crisis in Ceylon. On the one hand we have the cumulative build-up 
  of the Sri Lankan state driven by a powerful sectarian ideology whose inertia 
  is difficult to break. Its armed forces are almost entirely Sinhalese. The Tamils 
  are grossly unrepresented in the public services and are almost invisible in 
  the higher rungs. These have spurred sentiment in favour of an alternative state 
  structure for the Tamils.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>On the other hand since July 1983 hundreds of thousands of alienated 
  Tamils have settled down in the West. As a consequence the militarist and nationalistic 
  appeal of the LTTE has won an audience who are little concerned about the destructive 
  consequences of this politics for the people at home. There has also been an 
  exodus of a large number of Tamils from the North-East to the South. In a situation 
  of war and security fears, they are constantly harassed by the security authorities 
  and are shunned by employers. Even when there is a change for the better with 
  new openings in the politics of the South, the politics of the Tamil elite is 
  unable to come out of the shadow of the LTTE, and make a gesture of goodwill 
  and demonstrate a willingness to understand the anxieties of the Sinhalese.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>We have here a potent link between the globalisation of life through 
  modern technology, communication and commerce; the vested interests of a migrant 
  diaspora that are very different from those of the group remaining in their 
  troubled home; and the empowerment and sustaining power of a militant force 
  driving towards and driven by socio-political fragmentation.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>The phases of Tamil nationalist politics are really two sides of the 
  same coin and parts of the same legacy. The earlier phase is a feeling of powerlessness, 
  where people lost even the will and sense of responsibility to exert themselves 
  in non-violent protest. Today people of the same class watch LTTE videos from 
  drawing rooms in the West, applauding tricked and brainwashed twelve year olds 
  performing suicidal feats of 'martyrdom' for the LTTE supremo.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>In turn the Sinhalese have acquired legitimate fears of the global spread 
  of Tamils and developments in neighbouring Tamil Nadu that have favoured support 
  groups for the LTTE that are strongly fascist and anti-Sinhalese. It is moreover 
  amidst these fears that the Sinhalese have to be persuaded to agree to a previously 
  unthinkable federal status for the Tamil speaking region, not with any certainty 
  of halting the march to destruction and fragmentation, but only as a means of 
  offering space for good sense to prevail. There are no panaceas. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>As a final reflection, a concentration on rights is meant to improve 
  the quality of life as a whole. In the conceptualisation of a particullar right 
  for disscussion, such as the right to self-determination, its relation to real 
  life settings and real people should not be lost sight of. Thus the right to 
  self -determination stands or falls with all other rights, such as in particular 
  Human Rights. We do not yet have anything like a vibrant internatinal order 
  that is capable of dealing with these rigths dynamically. A legalistic obsession 
  with one particular right, while turning a blind eye to the inner life of the 
  people concerned, could lead to making a parody of that very right, while negating 
  all other rights. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>The Tamils'right to self-determination remained largely a slogan , in 
  the absence of an inner development consciously casting off oppresive structures 
  and acquiring a basic human dignity within. To many influential outside observers, 
  violations of Human Rights remained violations by the Sri Lankan forces against 
  the Tamil people fighting for self-determination. What the Tamil people were 
  doing to themselves was mostly lost sight of. Today the life of this society 
  hangs in the balance. It even does not have the capacity to express its wishes 
  on such basic matters as the welfare of its children, or to influence in any 
  way its so-called representatives.</span></p>

  between the suicide &amp; homicide rates'. The latter refers to the effects 
  of war. Prior to the war, from 1963 to 1975 Jaffna society had a very high suicide 
  rate compared with the rest of the world, measuring 30 to 34 per 100,000. With 
  the onset of the war this dropped sharply for reasons easily guessed at. This 
  says something about the pathological nature of the society that drove its poor, 
  alienated and despairing into a cult of suicidal martyrdom. The authors also 
  suggest that in place of social cohesiveness that war often brings about in 
  other nations or groups in the face of an external threat, this war has brought 
  about 'signs of despair and resignation to fate'. </span></p>

  Mahinda, during the 3rd century BC. The Mahavamsa account (in chapter 19) strongly 
  suggests that the recipients are regional kingdoms, including Jaffna and at 
  least two in Ruhuna in the South, who acknowledged the ritual sovereignty of 
  the King of Anuradhapura-styled Maha Raja or Emperor. The same approach is evident 
  in pilgrimages to the Hindu shrine at Koneswaram in Trincomalee by the kings

  in 1948.Among the reasons may be a lower natural increase among Christians and 
  emmigration, especially of the Burgher community of European extraction. The 
  results of the work of the smaller evangelical churches is yet to reveal itself

-.15pt;'>Both authors trace the dilemma faced by the diverse, but largely Tamil 
  speaking, Muslim community in trying to fashion a national identity from the 
  19th century on the basis of religion, and the contradictions it encountered. 
  These contradictions resulted from a diversity in economic interests, regional 
  and cultural ties. A mythical Hashimite Arabic identity favoured by the Moor 
  elite in Colombo too seemed unconvincing to a community that hardly spoke Arabic, 
  and whose roots were local. Both authors agree that the Colombo Moor elite trying 
  to hitch the Muslims to one or both of the two major Sinhalese parties for a 
  few minor concessions has diluted the others' perception of the Muslims as a 
  people in their own right, making them a 'submerged minority' to use a term 
  coined by Izzeth Hussain. Resentment was first expressed by the Eastern Muslims, 
  a section of whom first supported Tamil secessionism and later went on to form 
  the Muslim Congress. Macan-Markar argues in favour of Ceylon as a cosmopolitan 
  nation based on individual rights rather than group rights, where his Muslimness 
  would not be a factor in his dealings with the state. Ismail favours local alliances, 
  where in the East for example, the Muslims would relate to Tamils and Sinhalese 
  in the locality as partners in articulating local interests.</span></p>

  it is not easy to realise that there has been considerable fusion between these 
  races in the past. The results of this fusion are most obvious on the western 
  coast between Negombo and Puttalam, where a large proportion of the villagers, 
  though they call themselves Sinhalese, speak Tamil, and are, undoubtedly, of 
  Tamil descent, their legendary ancestors being captives from India or imported 
  weavers and other artisans. As in 1911, a large number of the Kandyan Sinhalese 
  in Diddeniya palata in the Hiriyala hatpattu of the Kurunegala District are 
  Hindus and speak Tamil, though most of them read and write Sinhalese. They are 
  reported to have discontinued many Tamil customs, but they retain the practice 
  of tying the Tali at weddings. Similar settlements of Sinhalese of Tamil descent 
  are found elsewhere, being the descendants of Tamil mercenaries, captives, specially

  Sinhalese man to the Kandyan is same as that of the foreign born Tamil, Moor

  like Tamil ,was a Dravidian language. The position had been earlier taken by 
  Hugh Nevill, a British Civil Servant and admirer of Bishop Robert Caldwell (author

<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'>Kumari Jayewardana suggests 
  that the disenfranchisement of Tamil Hill Country labour was aimed to weaken 
  the Left. Out of the 95 MPs elected in 1947 ,18 were from the Left opposition 
  and the seven Hill Country representatives also generally voted with the opposition. 
  The vote of the Hill Country Tamils had been decisive in returning 14 Left candidates. 
  The ruling UNP had won only 42 seats and needed to attract several of the 21 
  independent candidates to form the government. The demonstration of Trade Union 
  power during the post-war years had also made the ruling- class nervous. It 
  could be seen that a combination of disenfranchisement of Indian labour and 
  colonisation programmes-which at first happened to be directed chiefly towards 
  areas which returned Left candidates-helped to weaken the power of the Left. 
  Some of these areas were Kegalle, Gampaha and the South. </p>

  rebellion of 1817/18 during which it faced enormous dislocation. The figures

<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'>The difference between Tamils

  1983 violence. Of the remaining Tamils, many had since been made refugees, locally, 
  outside the district and in India. See chapter 2 of UTHR(Jaffna) Report No 11

-.15pt;'>11. As mentioned earlier there were diverse strands in the Sinhalese 
  revival movement. But we are concerned here about the main thrust. One outstanding 
  figure in this movement was Dr.C W.W.Kannangara. A brilliant scholar from a 
  poor home in Galle, his political career began with the Temperance Movement, 
  leading to the Ceylon National Congress in the 20s and then the UNP. He shared 
  some of the influences common to the Sinhalese, Tamil and Muslim elite and also 
  those articulated by Dharmapala. In the Legislative Council debate of 1928 on 
  universal suffrage, he hinted that those who did not oppose Indian enfranchisement 
  would be considered traitors [see Kumari Jayawardana, 9. of section 3 above].</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>Where he was an exception was in his vision for education, leading to 
  the introduction of the Free Education Bill in the State Council in 1944, which 
  he steered through against considerable opposition. This was easier at that 
  time because he was Education Minister under the Executive Committee system 
  as distinct from the Cabinet system under the Soulbury constitution of 1947. 
  Following the enactment of the Bill, Central Schools were opened throughout 
  the country with a concentration on rural areas, with scholarships for the poor 
  from 5th standard up to University. The Bill was generally popular except with 
  large sections of the elite and the mission school establishments. The Bill 
  was also welcomed by savants of the Jaffna Youth Congress, several of whom served 
  as principals of Hindu schools that benefitted from free education.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>Yet the elite opposition to Kannangara and his associates was reflected 
  in their being lampooned in the Colombo press as rustic buffoons. There is said 
  to have been no love lost between Kannangara and D.S.Senanayake, his party leader 
  and the first prime minister of Ceylon, who was also the pioneer and driving 
  force behind colonisation schemes. It is said that Kannangara lost his seat 
  in the 1947 elections because of sabotage by his own party. Although Kannangara 
  returned for one more term as Minister for Local Government from 1952-56, the 
  larger aims of free education seemed to have suffered permanent dilution, if 
  one looks more closely at the figures.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>Over 10 years from about 1950, the number of schools in Ceylon offering 
  candidates for university entrance increased from 65 to 216 (- by centres, 99 
  in Colombo, 47 in Kandy, 37 in Jaffna and 33 in Galle). But of these only 102 
  had facilities for teaching science. Although the disparity between Jaffna and 
  Galle is not significant here, the picture changes when one looks at science 
  (29 &amp; 4 respectively). In this development little thought was given to employment 
  and careers. In 1959 out of 3938 candidates at university entrance 2231 offered 
  Arts(Humanities), of whom 1749 took Sinhalese as a subject. The highest proportion 
  of passes were in Sinhalese and Tamil (85 &amp; 80% respectively). The following 
  year the number of Arts candidates jumped to 3416. [See Nesiah above.] The resulting 
  disillusionment burst out in 1971.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>The teaching of science requires greater investment, since it involves 
  laboratories. A shortage of teachers cannot be a cause for the neglect of science 
  in the Sinhalese South during the 50s, since English was the medium of instruction. 
  There were teachers from Jaffna and Kerala working in the South and more could 
  have been hired. This is a case of colonisation, then at its peak, taking greater 
  priority over education and the development of a modern infrastructure.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'>Another interesting document 
  of this period is 'The Betrayal of Buddhism', the Report of the Buddhist Committee, 
  1956. In the Committee were eminent Buddhist educationists of that time - viz. 
  G.P.Malalasekera (former Director of Education), P.de S Kularatna (former Principal 
  of Ananda College) and L.H.Mettananda (former Principal of Nalanda College). 
  The Report had a long section on education, but had hardly anything to say on 
  regional disparities affecting rural folk who were mostly Buddhists and Hindus. 
  Much of the criticism was directed at Grant-in-Aid mission schools, where it 
  was said the Buddhists faced disabilities in respect of the teaching of their 
  own faith and were subject to conversion to Christianity by unfair means. The 
  Protestants were regarded as being more accommodative. The main thrust of criticism 
  was against the Roman Catholic Church and Catholic Action in particular. The 
  latter, it said, was a hierarchically directed organisation which used all 
  sleights of hand at its disposal to undermine Buddhist interests and forward 
  their own. The Report had no complaints against Tamils in general. </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>It would seem that the advantage Jaffna enjoyed in science education 
  was not made an issue until the 70s.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>Peebles shows how the dry-zone of the former Kandyan Kingdom, a sparsely 
  populated but ethnically diverse region, was transformed by colonization into 
  an almost Sinhalese Buddhist region. He also points to the ideological significance 
  attached by President Jayawardene himself to the Accelerated Mahaveli Programme, 
  often referring to the golden threads linking his administration with that of 
  'Sinhalese Kings'. While 78,000 families had been settled under this scheme 
  by the end of 1988 and while they had 216 Buddhist temples, they were given 
  only 113 new primary schools because of financial difficulties. This once mixed 
  area now had only 5 Hindu temples. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>Peebles also critically looks at the writings of G.H.Peiris and Godfrey 
  Gunatilleke on the subject of colonisation within during the mid-80s.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'>Bastian begins by pointing out 
  that the unitary state ruled from Colombo owns about 82% of all land in the 
  country, and has used this as a very potent source or power and patronage, including 
  the creation of new electorates for the patron at the expense of the minorities 
  who were not party to this patronage. He then goes on to discuss the devolving 
  of power over state land. </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>Abeysinghe discusses the AMDP, including returns on investment and such 
  topics as the pauperisation of settler-farmers and hidden tenancy to owners 
  of inputs and Mahaveli officials. The settlers thereby become tenants, labourers 
  or sharecroppers on their own land. He sees in this a consolidation of larger 
  production units and a growth of entrepreneurship among a successful new class 
  of individuals, who also become political players.</span></p>

  right next to existing Tamil &amp; Muslim villages, barring their prospects 
  of getting land under village expansion schemes. On the supposition that a reliable 
  alternative source of water was being made available, local and self-contained 
  storage facilities (eg. Allai &amp; Peruveli tanks) were reduced (in area) to 
  find lands for the colonisation scheme.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>In the Kanthalai scheme, the colonies were planted upstream while the 
  existing Tamil &amp; Muslim farmers were downstream. The latter now have little 
  influence in managing the water. In time encroachers upstream, and the government 
  sugar factory began to take precedence over the downstream native farmers in 
  the supply of water. Pledges given to the latter in the 50s had become a dead 
  letter by 1990, as pointed out by the Thampalakamam Citizen's Committee.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>On the first point, Bastian ( Section 5, 11 above) has pointed out that 
  out of 2,052,900 acres of state land alienated from 1935 to 1985, 43% or 882,600 
  acres, the largest category, went to village expansion schemes, 21% or 434,600 
  acres to major colonisation schemes, and 25% in regularisation of encroachments. 
  The planting of the Allai Scheme ensured that several Tamil and Muslim villages 
  in the area could not get land under the first and third categories. The Sinhalese 
  colony areas in Allai were then brought under the Seruvila AGA division. The 
  Tamils and Muslims were in the Mutur AGA division which was now surrounded by 
  the sea on two sides, the Mahaveli river to the west and Seruvila to the South. 
  Land alienation is now a subject devolved to the AGA division. It was thus made 
  very difficult for the native Tamils and Muslims to get further land. In Kanthalai, 
  the old Tamil village was left in the middle of the colonisation scheme,thus 
  preventing its further expansion. Those of the village suffered during the 1977 
  communal violence and do not feel free to vote for a Tamil party during elections. 
  Several of them have sold and left.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>Several new Sinhalese AGA divisions have been carved out in Trincomalee 
  district,effectively blocking Tamils and Muslims from getting land in these 
  divisions. To say the least, the Tamils and Muslims had no influence with the 
  Great Land-Owner in Colombo, who did not regard them worthwhile candidates for 
  patronage.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>See also Peebles &amp; Bastian in 12.of 5.above.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'>3.As regards representation, 
  the arrangement under the Soulbury scheme of 1947 was 25 seats on the basis 
  of one representative for every 1000 square miles and 70 seats on the basis 
  of one representative for 75,000 inhabitants. The Northern and Eastern Provinces 
  had 16 seats, 8 on the basis of area and 8 on population. Of the 95 MPs elected 
  in 1947, 19 MPs were Tamil, 12 from the North-East and 7 from the Hill Country. 
  The remaining 4 in the North-East went to Muslims. Following the disenfranchisement 
  of Hill Country Tamils, their 7 seats effectively went to Kandyan Sinhalese 
  as a bonus from 1952.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>Colonisation too had the effect of shifting representation in favour 
  of Sinhalese. A new scheme introduced in the 1978 constitution where election 
  was on the basis of proportional representation rather than first-past-the-post. 
  The scheme was 36 MPs on the basis of 4 for each province (8 for the North-East) 
  and 160 evenly divided among those on the voters list. The district is today 
  the unit for proportional representation. To see how colonisation affects a 
  minority, take Amparai District. Prior to the Gal Oya scheme in the late 40s, 
  about 30% of its population was Tamil. After colonisation about 20% are Tamil. 
  Owing to a division of the Tamil vote between different parties, not one of 
  the six MPs elected from the district in 1994 is Tamil. The same could now also 
  happen in the Trincomalee District. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>Of the 196 MPs elected in 1994, 17 are Tamils from the North-East and 
  6 are from among Hill Country Tamils who recovered their citizenship from the 
  late 70s. Thus the elected Tamil representation has declined from 20% of the 
  elected MPs in 1947 (when they were 23% of the population) to 12% in 1994 when 
  they were about 18% of the population.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt;'>It is thus not difficult to work out how the disenfranchisement of Hill-Country 
  Tamils and colonisation had both worked to severely depress the representation 
  of minorities to the benefit of the majority.</span></p>
