<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><b><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman";letter-spacing:-.15pt'>The 
  historic role of the minorities</span></b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'>The Three bills of 1948/49 which 
  deprived the Hill Country(Indian) Tamils of the vote and virtually consigned 
  them to serfdom were supported by most MPs from the two main remaining minority 
  communities - the Ceylon Tamils and the Muslims. Had it not been for this betrayal 
  of a fellow minority community, the UNP government of the day would have been 
  hard put to justify and secure the passage to these bills. Ironically the strongest 
  and intellectually incisive opposition to these bills came from the mostly Sinhalese 
  Left opposition. This says much about the nature of the state and the leadership 
  of the minorities that remains true to this day. The significance of the event 
  itself was largely ignored, thus passing lightly over a portent of today's state 
  of affairs. Most Ceylon Tamils would date the beginning of evils to 1956(the 
  Sinhala Only Act) or the early 70s(standardisation &amp; the 1972 constitution). 
  This signifies a dangerous self-centredness.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span> </span>The 
  oppressive character of the state implicit in the bills of 1948/49 was not simply 
  a problem for the minorities. But as recent tragedies have shewn, it was one 
  for the vast majority of Sinhalese themselves. As the first victims of the bankruptcy 
  of Sinhalese chauvinist politics, the minorities had a historic liberating role 
  on behalf of all the people of Ceylon.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span> </span>The 
  character of the minority leadership was one of sycophancy towards the Sinhalese 
  state combined with a mafia type approach at home, using a mixture of patronage 
  and thuggery, going to great lengths to preserve their local authority. The 
  first task of liberation was to expose such leaders, and unite the minorities 
  behind common secular values and liberating goals. Why did this not happen? 
  Why, instead, did the leading Tamil group take to destroying a fellow minority, 
  the Muslims, besides a significant section of its own community? Why a repetition 
  of the folly of 1948/49 in this most obnoxious form? As Tamils it is imperative 
  that we answer these questions and distance the Tamil cause from the deeds of 
  those who act in our name.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><u><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt'>The politics of servility and the drift to fascism</span></u></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'>Ultimately, whether or not a 
  politics is liberating is judged, not by slogans, as provocative and defiant 
  as they may be, but by whether it empowers the people and gives them dignity 
  and control over their lives. If not this politics is bound to lead to tragedy 
  and servility- towards the state, external powers or both. Indeed,slogans with 
  regard to the problems of Hill Country Tamils, Muslims and the depressed castes 
  have been raised in Tamil politics. But in action these were only a skin deep. 
  Our history reveals that any earnestness did not go beyond immediate political 
  gain. The TULF's resolution for a separate Tamil state in the North-East in 
  1976, and hitching the nationalist bandwagon, in the popular mind, to irrelevant 
  symbols such as the Kingdom of Jaffna and those pertaining to the imperial Cholas, 
  shewed gross insensitivity. These symbols are not as harmless as they may seem. 
  They pandered to Jaffna, high-caste complacency. The Eelam resolution itself 
  weakened the cause of the minorities by leaving the Hill Country Tamils out 
  in the cold. When Muslims, Eastern Tamils and depressed castes shewed a lack 
  of enthusiasm for the Tamil cause as articulated by the Jaffna elite, which 
  was reflected in the TULF's electoral fortunes, they were treated with suspicion. 
  Denigrative cliches about them were allowed to gain ground and seep into the 
  consciousness of people unchecked. The state encouraged and used these differences 
  to further its ends. But it was precisely the task of a liberating politics 
  to elevate the consciousness of people so as to overcome the state's machinations. 
  A politics that united the minorities had to be worked for. What happened was 
  that we put forward a set of narrow, emotive slogans, void of content and positively 
  alienating to many, and did no work towards understanding and coming to terms 
  with the feelings of others. When others did not fall in line, we expressed 
  surprise and treated them as traitors.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span> </span> We 
  need not look far to understand today's attitudes to Muslims. The unwritten 
  history of caste oppression in Jaffna, as Sinnathamby Velayutham points out 
  in his column in the `Thayagam', was far more violent and humiliating than is 
  admitted. The same writer cites the cases of K.Daniel, of the Mass Front for 
  Removal of Untouchability. Since 1966 the Front had become a force to be reckoned 
  with and had publicly opposed the JVP.In 1971, the time of the first JVP insurrection, 
  following a staged explosion, Daniel was pointed out to the police as a JVP 
  activist. Daniel was held for a year and released without charges. There was 
  little, if any, voicing of public indignation that such an important Tamil was 
  the victim of caste motivated treachery.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span> </span>M.C.Subramaniam 
  was one of those described a traitor worthy of an abject death from a TULF(FP) 
  platform in 1972 by Kasi Anandan, now the LTTE's poet laureate. Subramaniam, 
  then leader of the depressed castes was no traitor. He had been one of the more 
  service oriented MPS who did not use his position to enrich himself, not even 
  by accepting gifts. A humble bicycle remained his mode of transport. Though 
  it was predominently the high castes who went to him for favours, few cared 
  to ask him why he felt as he did.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span> </span>The 
  LTTE today wears the insignia of the main strand in Tamil nationalist politics. 
  Its slogans have convinced some foreign observers that it stands for caste emancipation. 
  But its real position on the matter is a pointer to its attitude to Muslims. 
  It was commonplace for LTTE supporters to campaign against the EPRLF by associating 
  it with the low castes. When Varadarajaperumal was chief minister of the North-East, 
  posters appeared in Jaffna using his Indian Tamil origins to denigrate him. 
  The LTTE never condemned these and ask for criticisms to be based only on the 
  actions of individuals or organisations. It was, to say the least, happy to 
  stay silent and use anything that served its short term ends. It was this fundamentally 
  weak cause, that made a virtue of insensitivity, duplicity and treachery, that 
  turned to massacring Muslims. The same degenerate social values of the Tamil 
  elite, which insulated them from feeling a sense of moral indignation or remorse 
  at children being dragooned into becoming engines of death, and the sordid history 
  of caste oppression, now made it easy to rationalise massacres of Muslim women 
  and children.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><b><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt'>The LTTE and the Muslims</span></b><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
letter-spacing:-.15pt'></span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span> </span>The 
  LTTE has consistently denied massacring Muslims. In the 7th Aug 1992 issue of 
  `Kalathil', the LTTE journal published from Paris, it has an unsigned article 
  with the title `The Tamil Liberation Struggle and the Muslims of Tamil Ealam'. 
  It gives a version of events with several gaps. Massacres of Muslims for instance 
  are not mentioned. Muslims are collectively accused of ganging up against the 
  Tamils, first with the Sri Lankan state, then with `Indian imperialism' as represented 
  by the IPKF and since June 1990 again with the Sri Lankan state. The article 
  repeatedly stresses that(the vast majority of) Muslims collectively regard Tamils 
  as their enemies and have indulged in atrocities against them. It is implied 
  that whole Muslim villages acted as informers to the forces. The article concludes:</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><b><span> </span>&quot;It 
  seems that the Muslim people believe that their freedom, identify and dignity 
  will be(best) protected by(their) destroying Tamils... What we Tigers wish to 
  say(ask) here is (simply) this:</b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><b><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt'>WHO IS OUR ENEMY? WHO IS OUR FRIEND?.....</span></b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><b><span> </span>&quot;The 
  Muslims who are a part of the Tamil Nation are not enemies of the Tamils. They 
  are meant to live in unity with the Tamils. The real enemies of the Muslims 
  are Sinhalese chauvinism and Indian expansionism. They must realise this truth 
  and repent their feeling of enmity towards Tamils. Their future lies in unity 
  with the Tamils&quot;.</b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span> </span>The 
  context of the article leaves no doubt that this is the authentic position of 
  the Tigers. The Tigers have frequently made it clear that there is only one 
  treatment for enemies and traitors. (See for instance p6 of `Kalathil', 19.9.92.) 
  Notwithstanding denials, it is clearly official Tiger policy to massacre Muslims, 
  including women and children. The old line of the Jaffna Tamil elite towards 
  other minorities, that while they have been lenient, generous and considerate, 
  others have been treacherous and ungrateful, has passed unchanged to the Tigers. 
  This is in fact the mirror image of the Sinhalese chauvinist line as regards 
  Tamils.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span> </span>Such 
  stereotyping of Muslims or any group of people runs contrary to the whole spirit 
  of the liberation struggle, and is as execrable as Sinhalese communalists subjecting 
  the Tamils to collective violence. The reality within the Muslim community is 
  as complex and variegated as in any other community. Whether the forces that 
  gain leadership ascendancy are edifying or destructive depends much on historical 
  circumstances and anxieties. For the Tamils to see mere treachery in Muslim 
  homeguard violence, is very similar to the stance of Sinhalese chauvinists as 
  regards the Tamil militancy. They closed their eyes to July 1983 and all that 
  preceded it and saw the Tamil militancy merely as an Indian ploy. When Sinhalese 
  communalists insisted that we Tamils were Sri Lankans, we felt strongly that 
  we had to say NO! How is it that many fail to understand why many Muslims, depressed 
  castes and Eastern Tamils say NO to the Jaffna elite vision of the Tamil Nation? 
  The unity of the peoples of Ceylon has to be worked for by a politics of understanding 
  and healing. The same is true for the unity of Tamil speaking peoples.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span> </span>Recent 
  contacts of the UTHR(Jaffna) with Muslims in the East leaves me convinced that 
  the overwhelming majority of Muslims desire normal, peaceful and friendly relations 
  with Tamils, and disapprove of the actions of home guards. The same holds for 
  the Tamils, who have little control over the LTTE. Both communities are trapped 
  in a politics of permanent conflict and permanent destruction. One set of killers 
  to legitimise their power over a people, need to endanger them by propping up

<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><b>There can be no case for 
  unleashing murder on a community.</b> But in appearing to make a case the 
  Tigers advance certain claims and give their own version of events. How true 
  these are will be a pointer to whether their politics is one of strength or 
  one of deceit, desperation and destruction. The LTTE claims that Muslims were 
  first agents of the Sri Lankan state, then of India and the IPKF, and then from 
  June 1990, again of the Sri Lankan state. Let us see what really transpired.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span> </span>There 
  have been simmering tensions between Muslims and Tamils in certain areas of 
  the East, as was to be expected. In many places, such as Eravur and Nintavur, 
  there are no records of tensions. Muslim youth were part of the Tamil militant 
  struggle in the early 80s. In the mid 80s when sections of Tamil militants started 
  becoming rough in their dealings with Muslims and extortionate demands were 
  made, the state used this to foment communal violence,particularly in 1984 &amp; 
  85. Nevertheless the Muslims largely went along with militant demands, maintained 
  relations and paid `taxes'.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><b><span> </span>There 
  had as mentioned been friction between some neighbouring Muslim and Tamil communities 
  which in the normal course of events erupted and subsided without leaving permanent 
  scars. In 1984 special units of the Sri Lankan constabulary and agents were 
  inducted into the East to foment violence with a view to making these local 
  differences permanent. Attacks on Tamils were led by agents of the state. The 
  worst attacks were Karaitivu and Navatkudah, near Kattankudy with sizeable damage 
  to Tamil life and property. The second attack was led by a police armoured car. 
  Agents had spread rumours and had announced that Muslims in Kattankuddy were 
  about to be attacked.</b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><b><span> </span>But 
  it was precisely the task of a liberation struggle to understand the roots 
  of fear and suspicion between communities and politically isolate those few 
  who thrive on these.</b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span> </span>That 
  Muslims were collectively agents of the IPKF is totally unhistorical. Owing 
  to the past conduct of the Sri Lankan forces, it was the Tamils more than the 
  Muslims who welcomed the IPKF. Follwing the outbreak of hostilities between 
  the LTTE and the IPKF, it was in the East the Muslims who suffered most. About 
  40 Muslims were killed in the first IPKF reprisals in the East in November 1987. 
  The LTTE fired at an IPKF convoy and had run away (deliberately according to 
  local observers) through the Muslim village of Oddaimavady. Up to a 100 Muslims 
  were killed at Kattankudy during December 1987 in LTTE reprisals, following 
  a few individuals attacking the local LTTE agent.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span> </span>When 
  it came to be believed that the IPKF was there to stay, leaders from BOTH communities 
  co-operated with the IPKF. But because of the attitudes of pro-Indian Tamil 
  militant groups towards Muslims, many Muslims helped the LTTE. The LTTE gained 
  Muslim recruits and Muslims were then the mainstay of the LTTE's survival in 
  the East. When the IPKF withdrew from most parts of the East in late 1989, the 
  main victims of LTTE killings were Tamils. BUt friction with Muslims increased 
  as the LTTE pushed its brand of authorisationism. Greater discomfort developed 
  as Muslim leaders politely reminded the LTTE of its pledges made to visiting 
  Muslim representatives in India during 1987, promising autonomy for Muslim religious 
  and cultural life. But taxes or contributions were faithfully paid.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span> </span>The 
  outbreak of the war in June 1990 followed the LTTE murdering over a hundred 
  surrendered Muslim policemen along with their Sinhalese and vanishing. Anger 
  among local Muslims was used by the government and Muslim hoodlums were mobilised 
  in anti-Tamil violence. Even so the Batticaloa district remained calm, and Muslim 
  traders continued feeding Tamil civilians who were cut off. With deliberate 
  calculation the LTTE destablished the Batticaloa District with massacres of 
  Muslims in Kurukkalmadam, Kattankudy ad Eravur from 12th July to 12th August 
  1990. </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span> </span>At 
  this time there were a large number of Muslim cadre in the LTTE, including a 
  hundred from Eravur. At first the LTTE told them that the Muslim civilians were 
  massacred by the Sri Lankan forces. But doubts began to emerge. It later transpired 
  that even some Muslim families who had been close to the LTTE and had materially 
  supported them had been eliminated willy nilly. The Muslim cadre also feared 
  that the LTTE would next act against them. Most of them deserted and surrendered 
  to the Sri Lankan forces. Some who too afraid to surrender and remained in hiding, 
  were handed over to the SL forces and, it is believed, were eliminated.[UTHR(J), 
  Report No 8, Ch 4]. It is ironical who should accuse whom of treachery.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span> </span>The 
  government playing the LTTE's game, mobilised Muslim hoodlums in the Batticaloa 
  District, as well, in violence against Tamils. Given that the Srilankan State 
  is what it is, this was the case of a bankrupt `liberation group' preying on 
  fomenting destruction and making the people powerless for its survival.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span> </span>Against 
  the LTTE's unsustainable claim that Muslims were collectively agents of the 
  Sri Lankan and Indian states, let us examine the LTTE's own performance. Having 
  weakened the Tamil struggle militarily by wiping out other groups in 1986, the 
  LTTE was desperately looking for Indian patronage. The LTTE then boasted that 
  it had given India a foothold in Sri Lanka (`The Broken Palmyra', vol II, chapter 
  6). There is testimony from other militant leaders as well as circumstantial 
  factors to suggest that the LTTE carried out the Anuradhapura massacre of April 
  1985 at the behest of the Indian RAW, in a bid to become India's favourite (Time, 
  April 1989) Then later as Sri Lankan patriots working closely with the Premadasa 
  government from April 1989 - June 1990, the LTTE with the connivance of the 
  Sri Lankan forces cracked down on Tamil and Muslim opposition, however passive, 
  through murder and imprisonment. The roots of treachery and deception lay elsewhere. 
  The LTTE was far more prominently what it accused its victims of. This brings 
  us to the question, why really did the LTTE turn its guns on the Muslims?</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt'>Doomed by the nemesis of violence</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span> </span>As 
  pointed out at the beginning, the strength of a politics is not judged by its 
  slogans, Prabaharan's Suthumalai speech, by its capacity to shoot or intimidate 
  opponents, the length of its hit lists, or by its ability to frustrate and 
  destroy. Strength only lays in giving the people sound human values, dignity, 
  confidence in themselves individually and in their collective strength. A politics 
  that is weak is driven to servility by the logic of the ground situation. If 
  the politics of the minority leaders in 1948/49 was servile and unprincipled 
  , that of the LTTE which came in that tradition was even more so. Its dealings 
  with the Sri Lankan and Indian states, while portraying an air of defiance, 
  was ultimately servile in a very real and more desperate fashion. This is the 
  thrust of the message of the late Dr.Rajani Thiranagama (he Broken Palmyrah', 
  vol II, ch.6).</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span> </span>The 
  logical culmination of the LTTE's politics is to grasp at survival through making 
  the people weak, servile and insecure, and preying on their fears and worst 
  instincts. It thus needed to create division and hatred. Stirring up extreme 
  Tamil-Muslim animosity became a ready means of accomplishing its aims. The pattern 
  of events shews that by August 1990 this had become deliberate policy.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span> </span>Commenting 
  on the long term effects of this policy, a young man with a 20 year long committment 
  to the struggle had this to say: &quot;In January 1974, 9 persons died of electocution 
  when the police charged into the International Tamil conference in Jaffna. We 
  were then doing our A' Levels. The event consumed our youth and distorted our 
  rationality for years. Just imagine how the deliberate masscre of over a hundred 
  worshippers at the Kattankuddy Mosque would do to Muslim youth&quot;.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span> </span>This 
  politics needed stereotyped enemies, and the fact that Muslims fitted the bill 
  is partly accidental. The LTTE in the past had displayed paranoia when dissent 
  or disenchantment with it was associated with a village or communal group. The 
  LTTE, as mentioned, has shewn a readiness to use caste and people's origins 
  in campaigning against opponents. Caste had been an emotive issue in Jaffna 
  in the latter -60s with the government trying to cash in, as with Tamil-Muslim 
  differences in the East in the mid-80s. The issue is still only papered over. 
  With the politics so depraved, had the Muslims not been there, some other communal 
  division could have easily served the LTTE's purpose.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span> </span>A 
  glaring consequence of its destructive violence is that its vision of Tamil 
  Eelam, on behalf of which thousands have been and are being sacrificed, has 
  become totally untenable. If this vision is to be realised, the LTTE, even if 
  it can manage the Tamils,has to enact a Bosnian scenario where the Muslims are 
  concerned. This is practically beyond the LTTE's capabilities. The rhetoric 
  remains, together with its associated human sacrifice. This obnoxious vision 
  of Eelam too leads a shadowy twilight existence in the minds of prominent LTTE 
  supporters. But only so with a huge dose of amnesia. This will be the subject 
  of the next article.  </p>
