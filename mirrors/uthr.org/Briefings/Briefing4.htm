<blockquote>
<p><i>&quot;Contemporary conflicts are fundamentally different form those that 
    dominated the first 75 years of this century (Goodhand and Hulme, 1998a). 
    These 'post -nation state wars' are largely internal struggles in which clear 
    interests are difficult to disentangle (Duffield, 1999); death and disablement 
    are concentrated on civilians rather than combatants; and population movements 
    take place within as well as across national borders. In 1995, around 14 million 
    people were refugees and some 23 million were internally displaced (forced 
    to relocate within their own country; ODI, 1998,p.2). It is one of the great 
    paradoxes of modern times that globalisation has been associated with increased 
    intrastate tensions. Far from the 'end of history' predicted by liberal commentators 
    after the collapse of communism, &quot;history' (or at least historical forces) 
    has returned with a vengeance across Europe, Asia and Africa as ethnic, nationalist, 
    religious and cultural groups have proclaimed their identities in often aggressive 
    and exclusive forms. <b>While it has become fashionable to equate virtue with 
    civil society, these events serve to remind us that civil society (like states 
    and businesses) has a dark side too</b>.&quot;</i><br>
    [NGOs in a global future: marrying local delivery to world wide leverage : 
    Michael Edwards et al, PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT, Public Admin.Dev.19, 
    117-136 (1999)]<br>
  </p>
  <p><font size="+3">T</font>he aim of this briefing is to clarify our position 
    on the following two connected issues: </p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><br>
      (i) Virtual elimination of democratic space available in the North and East 
      for public discussion on matters related to peace based on a political solution, 
      going beyond LTTE's agenda,-- here we wish to address some of the issues 
      raised by a recent press release of the National Peace Council (NPC) entitled 
      &quot;<a href="NPCMediaRelease.htm" target="_blank">One-Sided Criticism 
      of the Trincomalee Peace Conference&quot;</a>, and </p>
    <p>(ii) the role of peace activists and civil society organizations operating 
      in an environment of internal and external terror in these regions. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><br>
    At the onset we wish to dissociate from the tone and substance of the Island 
    editorial on October 22, 2001 that called for an investigation of the NPC 
    under the PTA. We are, moreover, concerned over the ever shrinking space for 
    real and meaningful public debates/discussions regarding sustainable peace 
    in Sri Lanka. We are well aware that in the North and East terror - created 
    by the totalitarian politics of LTTE on the one hand and the judicial and 
    extra judicial instruments employed by the State on the other - has severely 
    curbed such democratic spaces. The call to investigate the NPC - a group that 
    is actively working towards peace - under the PTA - is precisely the kind 
    of activity that could become a threat to free public discussions on peace. 
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>We wish to offer our sincere apologies to the NPC for any inconvenience caused. 
    We are well aware that many of the NPC members share a deep commitment for 
    peace and are working hard towards achieving that goal.<br>
  </p>
  <p>While UTHR (Jaffna) unequivocally supports efforts towards a political solution 
    to the ethnic conflict, history has taught us valuable lessons in identifying 
    and avoiding some of the pitfalls faced by peace activists. <a href="../bulletins/bul27.htm" target="_blank">Bulletin 
    27</a> of UTHR(J) discussed child recruitment in the East by the LTTE and 
    flagged some concerns regarding the peace conference the NPC co-sponsored 
    in Trincomalee. Their press release in response to Bulletin 27 brings out 
    very pertinent issues facing all peace activists in Sri Lanka. We welcome 
    this open exchange with the NPC. We would like to take this opportunity to 
    present our views on the role and goals of peace activity in civil society.</p>
  <h3>On the Goals of Peace conferences</h3>
  <p>In the following passages, we present a brief description of our understanding 
    of the ground reality of peace efforts in Sri Lanka in general, and the North 
    and East in particular. We will also elaborate our vision of the role of civil 
    society organizations in this process. Our analysis is based on the following 
    premises:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li>We share the conviction that tasks of achieving peace based on a political 
    solution calls for an open discussion &amp; a mass movement - hence the effort 
    will involve the participation of a range of civil society organizations.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>It has become clear that the LTTE will turn against any peace negotiations 
    that do not recognize it as the sole legitimate representative of the Tamil 
    people while giving unconstraint control of the North East. The LTTE's politics 
    is primarily defined by its ideologically-driven military agenda and its ideology 
    rather than by any concern for the civilian well being.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>The LTTE has eliminated all opposition and exercises total domination in 
    the regions it controls - i.e., it appropriates or directs the efforts of 
    all organized forms of civil society-through an organic surveillance system. 
    As a result, in their areas of control, sustained independent protest and 
    public dissent has become impossible. </li>
</ul>
<blockquote> 
  <p>We believe this to be the context in which all NGOs from the North and East 
    participate in peace conferences. We have presented our analysis of the efforts 
    to bring peace elsewhere and the ramifications of internal terror on the Tamil 
    community, the character of the State, and the nature of LTTE [See <a href="Briefing1.htm" target="_blank">Briefings 
    Nos 1</a>, <a href="Briefing3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>, <a href="../Reports/Report9/Report9.htm" target="_blank">Report 
    9</a> &amp; <a href="../Rajan/peace.htm" target="_blank">Peace: Understanding 
    our Reality! </a> by R.H &amp; K.S<b> (the last one written during the 1994 
    peace process)</b>]. <br>
  </p>
  <p><b>If we agree on the validity of these premises then peace activities must 
    contribute towards opening up democratic space for free and unhampered public 
    input and discussion on the goals and strategies towards sustainable peace.</b><br>
  </p>
  <p>Accordingly, NGOs pursuing peace must recognize the consequences of this 
    climate of internal terror in the North and East, of the near complete control 
    the LTTE exercises over all civil society activities within its domains of 
    control. We need to face difficult questions: What political space is available 
    for local participants in peace conferences who wish to continue to function 
    in their respective regions, to engage in a free exchange of views? If we 
    want to hear the views of the ordinary people of that region, how can we counter 
    the climate of internal terror that already manages the stage and writes the 
    script? What structures/mechanisms must be instituted in such conferences 
    to best produce a map of representative views? What is our responsibility 
    when those we proclaim to be our sole representatives are denying this democratic 
    space by engaging in activities ranging from forced child recruitment to political 
    killings?</p>
  <h3> On the Role of Peace Activists &amp; Stage Management</h3>
  <p>The first task that faces peace activists is to question the role of dominant 
    ideologies that perpetuate the conflict in their respective communities. The 
    peace activist must take responsibility for the actions of his or her community, 
    and work towards values in resonance with sustainable peace. <br>
  </p>
  <p>For a Sinhalese activist this means challenging the politics of the majority 
    and its implications on the minority communities and working towards changing 
    that reality. On the other hand, Tamil activists cannot totally rely on the 
    &quot;victimhood&quot; mentality to explain the LTTE's actions that can no 
    longer be explained simply as a reactive violence. They should challenge the 
    terror politics of the LTTE's and take responsibility for what the LTTE does 
    in their name. If not, the peace they aim for is severely flawed. <br>
  </p>
  <p>We realize that it will not be possible to challenge the actions of LTTE 
    and continue to function in the North and East. However, at the minimum, they 
    must feel some responsibility for the LTTE's actions. And with the help from 
    their Sinhalese colleagues, try to initiate a discussion of real problems 
    facing common people in the North and East. Activating such a discussion among 
    the Tamils requires very creative and real &quot; stage management&quot;.</p>
  <p>It is therefore, inadequate for Sinhalese activists, and the NGOs who visit 
    the North and East to be only sensitive to the immediate reality of war. They 
    need to be courageous enough to initiate discussions on a range of issues 
    that limit the democratic space; to question the actions of the LTTE that 
    has forced its war on the community. It is important for these NGOs to recognize 
    that such moves would challenge one of the dominant themes of Tamil politics, 
    namely that such an &quot;opening up of space&quot; is tantamount to &quot;dividing 
    the Tamil community from the LTTE&quot;.<br>
  </p>
  <p>Thus the Sinhalese and Tamil peace activists need to perform sometimes complementary 
    and mutually reinforcing tasks. We shall try to give one example to illustrate 
    our point. Consider the LTTE attack in early 1998 on the Dalda Maligawa that 
    is sacred to the Buddhists. If a Sinhalese activist wanted to address the 
    vindictive outrage an ordinary Sinhalese Buddhist might have felt, then it 
    is a necessary strategy to situate the attack in the context of the State 
    mixing politics with religion and resorting to indiscriminate aerial bombing 
    in Tamil areas. While this context provides no justification for the terror 
    attack, it attempts to explain to the Sinhalese, how the misdeeds of the State 
    make the Tamil community angry and insecure. This is an important part of 
    peace work.<br>
  </p>
  <p>What if the Tamil peace activists were to point only to the misdeeds of the 
    Sri Lankan State in trying to explain the attacks on Sinhalese and their symbols? 
    That will amount to no more than a justification of the attacks.</p>
  <p>On the other hand, they could question the motivation for the attack. Was 
    it to elicit a backlash against the Tamils? Why would the LTTE take a conscious 
    decision to attack a religious place, deliberately sacrificing several of 
    its own fighters, for no tangible military purpose? Can such an organization 
    claim to represent the whole Tamil society? When we have been condemning the 
    State for its indiscriminate bombing and damaging of many religious places, 
    how could we now defend this? These are questions the Tamils in general, and 
    Tamil peace activists in particular, need to address if we want to achieve 
    long term peace.<br>
  </p>
  <p>It is regrettable that soon after the attack on Dalada Maligawa, a prominent 
    activist from the NPC wrote an article in the Tamil weekly of the MIRJE, justifying 
    the attack. In that article she posed a question: &quot;Where else does one 
    expects the LTTE to attack, the Peradeniya Gardens?&quot; Here one is left 
    with an impression of the peace lobby as a loose collection of individuals 
    with private agendas, not subject to any discipline from binding values or 
    goals. It needs to be appreciated that Sinhalese members of the NPC have done 
    valuable work going around the South challenging Sinhalese chauvinism. By 
    the same token, one would have expected the Tamil members to challenge Tamil 
    chauvinism among Tamils. But they rather seem to be using the NPC to do the 
    opposite, and thus undermining NPC functioning as a peace group.<br>
  </p>
  <p>Thus in the context of internal terror, the democratic space in any peace 
    effort does not automatically open up when active Tamil groups with divergent 
    persuasions are invited to participate. How safe is a Tamil who engages with 
    the NPC (or any other NGO working towards peace) and voices opinions critical 
    of the LTTE? We know that many participants of the Trincomalee conference 
    have privately confided to individual members of the NPC their views and fears 
    regarding the LTTE. Yet the NPC must be aware that theses views and fears 
    regarding the LTTE did not find expression in the final statement that came 
    out of the Trincomalee conference. It is not that the Tamil activists do not 
    trust the Sinhalese in the NPC. They do not trust members of their own community. 
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>We, the Tamils, had in the past options in choosing our means, values and 
    political directions. In the early days, many argued for various options and 
    worked towards them. Just because the Sinhalese State was oppressive, most 
    Tamils did not fall into the chauvinist trap. They found abhorrent the idea 
    that massacring the Sinhalese and tearing the country apart by any means was 
    the only way forward for the Tamils. This issue becomes more important when 
    all the space is closed and very crucial when certain negative characteristics 
    are being institutionalized.</p>
  <p>The need to open up democratic space demands a re-evaluation of the very 
    premises for peace building. Further, it demands of peace activists in the 
    South to be creative and courageous enough to have an open discussion among 
    themselves as activists in their organizations before they could go to the 
    areas in the North-East. Unfortunately this culture of openness and discussion 
    of values is not part of the present NGO outlook. Instead, strategic considerations 
    and project formulations that fit into general models aimed at attracting 
    funds to sustain the organization, seem to dominate. </p>
  <h3>Are we against negotiations for a political settlement?</h3>
  <p>We wish to make it clear that the people and, especially, the Tamils want 
    the LTTE to negotiate with the government over the country's political future 
    and end the war. If the LTTE is to represent the aspirations of the people 
    and wants to negotiate a peaceful settlement, we shall be one hundred and 
    fifty percent behind them, despite their horrendous past record of crimes 
    against humanity. If that happens, it would wholly vindicate the NPC's claim 
    that the &quot;ultimate contribution to human rights lies in contributing 
    to bringing about a negotiated peace&quot;.<br>
  </p>
  <p>Unfortunately, the political survival of the LTTE has come to depend on the 
    perpetuation of the war. Hence the negotiation agenda of the LTTE has become 
    delinked from the desires and aspirations for peace harboured by the vast 
    majority of the Tamils under their control. Their focus has always been on 
    establishing a monopoly of control. This becomes apparent when we examine 
    last three instances when peace negotiations took place:<br>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The LTTE was on the run following the capture of Vadamaratchy sector in 
      June 1987 by the Sri Lankan Army. This resulted in the death of 300 civilians. 
      Much to the relief of the Tamil people, the IPKF arrived and peace reigned 
      for a short while. To secure its monopoly on power the LTTE forced the IPKF 
      into a war in October 1987. More than 1000 civilians were killed mainly 
      in reprisals and many originating in LTTE provocation (See <a href="../BP/Content.htm" target="_blank">Broken 
      Palmyra</a>).<br>
    </li>
    <li>In 1989, cornered by the IPKF, the LTTE entered into a deal with President 
      Premadasa, who ordered the IPKF to withdraw. The LTTE used the honeymoon 
      period to get rid of its political opponents by torture and assassinations 
      (See Report 9 <a href="http://www.uthr.org/Reports/Report9/chapter3.htm" target="_blank">Chapter 
      3</a>, Report 10 <a href="http://www.uthr.org/Reports/Report10/chapter4.htm" target="_blank">Chapter 
      4</a>). Then it started a war with the Sri Lankan government in June 1990. 
      Here it ensured maximum provocation by massacring hundreds of Muslim and 
      Sinhalese policemen who had already surrendered and further also by massacring 
      about 300 Muslim civilians in the East. Thousands of Tamil civilians were 
      killed in reprisals by the security forces and Muslim home guards(See Report 
      <a href="../Reports/Report4/Report4.htm" target="_blank">4</a> &amp; <a href="../Reports/Report5/Report5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>).</li>
    <li>In 1994 Chandrika Kumaratunge was elected to lead the country on a peace 
      platform. It was announced on 9th September 1994 that she and the LTTE leader 
      had exchanged warm letters expressing an eagerness to commence the peace 
      process. The first session of talks was fixed for 13th October. Offensive 
      military activities were frozen. While hopes for peace bloomed in the North 
      and South, the LTTE leader intervened in his characteristic style. On 19th 
      September he sent a suicide bomber to sink a naval vessel. In late October 
      1994 another suicide bomber killed UNP presidential candidate Gamini Dissanayake. 
      However, a ceasefire was agreed upon and messages were exchanged. The LTTE 
      kept making demands of a military nature and avoided engaging in political 
      talks. On 19th April 1995 the LTTE unilaterally broke the ceasefire by sinking 
      two naval vessels and shot down two air force planes with newly acquired 
      missiles. It also massacred 45 harmless Sinhalese fisherfolk in Kallara, 
      hoping for government reprisals against Tamil civilians as under the UNP 
      in 1990. Throughout this whole process the LTTE warned people in the North 
      and East against reciprocating the peace activity in the South. (See <a href="http://www.uthr.org/Statements/Renewalst.htm" target="_blank">statement</a>)<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>In addition to the LTTE showing very little interest in a negotiated peace, 
    there are no signs of independent mass movements or civil society organisations 
    capable of questioning and influencing the policies of the LTTE either. In 
    fact, there has not been such movement in many years. The LTTE does not have 
    a functioning political wing and has not allowed any independent activity 
    in the Tamil community. It has been responsible for the death of considerable 
    numbers of Tamil civilians and, particularly, those who were potentially capable 
    of building such a mass movement. Therefore, laying foundations in the form 
    of building a broad base of support for lasting peace and moving ahead is 
    hard work but not impossible.While the outcome cannot be guaranteed, we can 
    identify the obstacles and the pitfalls and work towards creating conditions 
    to ensure sustainable peace process that will lead to political solution. 
    A vibrant peace movement will help constrain the violent excesses of the participants. 
    It would further serve as a continuous reminder of the futility of war and 
    give confidence to the people that they are not powerless entities who can 
    only has to pray for the LTTE to change its politics. The vast majority of 
    Tamils are prepared for compromises and have shown this in the1994 presidential 
    election and in later elections by voting even for the Southern parties. <br>
  </p>
  <p>This obliteration of democratic space in the North-East is the source of 
    our prime concern. Contrary to what the NPC suggests, we are by no means opposed 
    to any negotiations between the Government and the LTTE. But we are critical 
    of any quick-fix approaches that ignore the need to lay foundations to make 
    negotiated peace sustainable.</p>
  <p>In the absence of a pressure from below, we are afraid that peace negotiations, 
    more than in the previous three instances, would result in our community being 
    pushed into a more devastating cycle of tragic violence. Short-term expediency 
    should not blind the peace activists and politicians.<br>
  </p>
  <p><b>Thus, if we want to avoid another repetition of tragedy, the main peace 
    agenda in the Tamil community must be to work towards giving the people the 
    means to make the LTTE accountable. </b></p>
  <h3>Obstacle to peace stems from the politics of the LTTE</h3>
  <p>We recognize that the LTTE as a group is rooted in narrow nationalist ideology 
    bent on asserting its dominance through internal terror. It is a group that 
    has made a virtue of political and internecine killings; It is a group that 
    has successfully established a robust international network that can provide 
    resources for relatively long periods; It is a group that has extended its 
    terror among the expatriate community to silence the dissidents and, most 
    importantly, it has perfected suicide politics to a point where, the resulting 
    ambience of fear, works subtly on decision-makers in the region. However, 
    it suffers from a severe mismatch between its huge material resources mainly 
    flowing from outside Sri Lanka and the dwindling human resources at its disposal 
    as the communities they control have become increasingly disillusioned and 
    desirous of escape from the savage misery of prolonged war. Hence its inexorable 
    need to compensate by virtually conscripting the whole community and relying 
    increasing on suicide bombers, women cadres and now children in sustaining 
    its military machinery.<br>
  </p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>As mentioned earlier, at every opportunity to achieve a political solution, 
      the LTTE disregarded the desire of the people for peace and imposed on them 
      a further round of war. <i>Even if cessation of hostilities is successfully 
      implemented, can it bring sustainable peace? </i>The LTTE has massacred 
      Sinhalese and Muslim civilians which was rationalized as retribution; it 
      has forcibly expelled Muslims from the North and claimed that it was to 
      protect them; it has been responsible for murdering dissidents and potential 
      competitors for political power within their regions of control. If we were 
      to succeed in bringing about a ceasefire, will there be peace for the Muslims, 
      Sinhalese and the Tamil dissidents in the North and East? <br>
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> To attain meaningful peace, it becomes essential that the following issues 
    are addressed in any peace forum. </p>
  <p><b>i) Use of child soldiers, </b></p>
  <p><b>ii) Political killings and suicide attacks</b></p>
  <p>To conclude, simply repeating that all political groups and the Tamil people 
    want negotiations and ignoring much else the people are unable to say due 
    to the terror in their midst, will reinforce the LTTE's terror. The LTTE cannot 
    work towards peace in a united Sri Lanka, owing to its agenda of achieving 
    a separate state based on inherent narrow nationalistic ideology. The various 
    means it has successfully employed in that endeavor has given it an image 
    of invincibility. The LTTE believes that even if temporarily their methods 
    brought negative repercussions, in the long run they could manipulate the 
    community, the &quot;enemy&quot;, and other civil society organizations or 
    structures, both locally and internationally, to their advantage in achieving 
    their set goal. This illusion of power would not be shaken,- unless we bring 
    into play the voices of the people into their schemes of thinking. Unless 
    we could at least make them accountable in connection with the two crucial 
    factors mentioned above, the chances remain dim indeed. All other adverse 
    effects that are the general effects of war can be more easily contained, 
    given the people's needs and current worldwide realties.<br>
  </p>
  <p>Its not only the Tamil people who have internalized the terror of the LTTE 
    and become powerless. Many intellectuals and peace activists as well as NGO 
    leaders in the South in some way continue indirectly to legitimize this terror. 
    Instead of responding to the tragic plight of the people who are victims of 
    its politics, they only see the LTTE's destructive power. It is this that 
    evokes their respect, with a belief that to criticize and question the LTTE 
    might provoke it. They elevate the LTTE to the status of Kali, the Goddess 
    in Hindu mythology, and seek means to pacify it, rather than exposing its 
    role, its politics and the resulting consequences. <br>
  </p>
  <p>It is part of this mindset to air such omniscient claims such as the President 
    having beome an obstacle to peace, because she has earned the LTTE leader's 
    ire as expressed in severe attacks on her, first verbal, then also physical. 
    This in turn is used to promote politicians who would appease the LTTE leader 
    instead, with supposed quick fixes drawn from the peace-makers' tool-kit. 
    In all this the interests of the people are glossed over. <br>
  </p>
  <p>The people need a political framework that gives them dignity and security 
    to live in peace, but what the LTTE wants is total control over the North-East 
    without having to expose itself by discussing a political solution. In spite 
    of all its failures and the mounting obstacles it faces, it would pursue the 
    goal of separation single-mindedly. Many in the South believe that allowing 
    the LTTE the control its seeks over the civilians, and mollycoddling them 
    with generous resources would transform them. This amounts to a total failure 
    to understand the nature of the LTTE and its military dynamism. Like several 
    times before, it will end in disaster. Thus negotiations based on a political 
    agenda cannot be set aside for tactical reasons of pacifying the LTTE. <br>
  </p>
  <p>However, if a peace process primarily aimed at negotiations for a political 
    settlement and opening up space, is not a feasible agenda for peace groups, 
    and civil society organizations in the Tamil community remined totally subservient 
    to the LTTE, then peace is going to be a pipe dream. That would leave only 
    the international community, if they so desire, to make the State and, particularly, 
    the LTTE, accountable. [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</p>

  <p align="center"><b><i><font color="#FF0000">&quot;No peace without justice; 
    no justice without truth&quot; </font></i></b></p>
  <p><i>We support all efforts working for a sustainable and just peace in Sri 
    Lanka. To this extent we see that peace, the democratization of political 
    space, and a fair political solution are distinct but deeply intertwined goals. 
    While different actors may focus their energies on one or the other of these 
    goals, their efforts should be informed by the essential connection between 
    these issues.</i></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><i>It is from this perspective that we advocate peace building in Sri Lanka. 
    Peace is more than the management of conflict; peace should entail movement 
    toward the sharing of political power through substantial devolution and the 
    recognition of the rights of minorities. Peace is also more than the cessation 
    of hostilities between different armies; peace should also involve the cessation 
    of hostilities between the political authority (be it the Sri Lankan government 
    or the LTTE) and the population it governs, particularly its minorities and 
    dissidents. </i></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><i>So we should always ask, &quot;what kind of peace?&quot; Had Hitler conquered 
    the world there would be a certain kind of peace between different armies 
    for a temporary period - but not a peace that is sustainable or just. When 
    faced with the hardships of war we may be tempted to opt for an illusory peace 
    that is merely a temporary hiatus in a war that becomes even more ruthless 
    and brings on even greater hardship. We hold little hope for a short-term 
    &quot;peace&quot; imposed by the state via pure military hegemony without 
    inter-ethnic justice and the decentralization of power, or temporary military 
    arrangements that appease the LTTE to manage the conflict. In our struggle 
    for greater democratization of political space, for respect for human rights 
    and accountability by all political actors, we seek to build a lasting and 
    just peace</i></p>
