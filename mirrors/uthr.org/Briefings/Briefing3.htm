      Thrust</font></b><font color="#990000"></font> </h2>
  </center>
  <p><font color="#990000">Two of our reports were in the press a few months ago 
    and this we welcome. In comparison with what prevailed 15 years ago, there 
    is today space in the South for a variety of conflicting expressions. But 
    the underlying message in the media is by and large, still tilted towards 
    preserving totalitarian and hegemonic attitudes in society. In this context 
    a number of items have also appeared in the press which have cited our reports, 
    some of which may give a wrong impression of our work to those not familiar 
    with it. This demands some clarification from us.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><font color="#990000">Our purpose for more than the last ten years has been 
    to make all parties to the conflict accountable. The rapid internal changes 
    within the Tamil community in the four years from July 1983, in a symbiotic 
    engagement with state-inspired and state-articulated violence had created 
    a novel situation. In its blood-spattered attempt to become the sole representatives 
    of the Tamil people, the LTTE brought about deep disillusionment, forcing 
    it to rely on child recruits. It found itself closing all space for open reflection 
    on where this course was taking the Tamils. Violence deliberately aimed at 
    provoking reprisals and bringing insecurity to the Tamil people became its 
    sole means of advancing its image as their liberators. This was evident in 
    their sabotaging any prospect of a healthy political process at various times, 
    especially during peace talks.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><font color="#990000">It was therefore clear to us in 1987 that if the main 
    objective of non-violent activism was to hold the State accountable, so as 
    to usher in a healthier political process, that stage had passed in 1983. 
    It was no longer adequate to expose the State or state forces alone. Some 
    of the most obdurate sources of continued anarchy and unending conflict had 
    shifted to within the body politic of Tamil society. The involvement of some 
    of us in writing the `the Broken Palmyra’ in the heat of the war with the 
    Indian Army, was intended to state the truth frankly about the sufferings 
    of the civilians and the actions of the armed parties. By so doing we principally 
    tried to open up space by getting the readers to ask themselves what was happening 
    within their community.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><font color="#990000">It also become clear to us, and to many others, that 
    state violence against Tamils, negation of democracy and internal violence 
    in the South, as well as in the North–East, are, all of them, manifestations 
    of the same phenomenon. This was evident in the Southern violence of the late 
    80s coming on the heels of July 1983 and the subsequent militarisation of 
    the State. The commencement of the war in June 1990 saw an increased outbreak 
    of malignancy on the part of the State as well as the LTTE. Where the role 
    of the media was concerned, they were dark times.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><font color="#990000">Thus opening up space had to be a joint endeavour involving 
    communities in all parts of the country. Our own efforts too were aimed in 
    this direction. In our reports we sought to tell the whole truth as best as 
    we could, bringing out what our own connections enabled us to do, as others 
    could not. We documented in the early 90s a good deal of the suffering in 
    the East inflicted by the state forces, which had assumed unprecedented proportions; 
    along with the depredations of the LTTE and its arrogant ideological violence 
    against Muslim communities.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><font color="#990000">We had right along in our reports articulated the view 
    that there was indeed an ethnic problem built up over decades by the State’s 
    anti –minority ideological stance. This was reflected at its worst by bouts 
    of communal violence from 1956, when the country’s leadership was found wanting 
    in both will and human feeling to quench the flames lit by their intemperate 
    words. The alienation of the minorities was in place well before the violence 
    of rebellion. The problem, whatever one wishes to call it, became much more 
    difficult to disentangle, leave alone understand, when the violence of rebellion 
    or liberation, transformed itself into ubiquitous internal terror, silencing 
    the saner voices within the Tamil community.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><font color="#990000">Along with many in the South who supported us, we realised 
    that the crisis within the Tamil community was so deep that it was in the 
    South that things were bound to open up sooner - as happened after the split 
    in the ruling UNP in 1991. Our reports too, from the 90s were aimed in part 
    at a southern audience. We also raised the issue of state-sponsored colonisation 
    - the largest single factor behind alienation in the East. The violence that 
    erupted in the Gal-Oya and Padaviya schemes in 1956 and 58 went a long way 
    to form distrust of the intentions of the State that came to be entrenched 
    in folk attitudes.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><font color="#990000">Our Special Report No 5 of 1993 and Bulletin No 5 of 
    1995 on the Weli Oya scheme exposed what was in fact a realisation of one 
    of the worst travesties of the stated developmental aims of state-sponsored 
    colonisation. Life had been made a nightmare for the Tamil civilians driven 
    away by calculated state violence a as well as for the Sinhalese civilians 
    inducted in to act as civilian shields and chattels of the security forces.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><font color="#990000">Many in the South who were looking for a democratic 
    and non-sectarian vision for Sri Lanka welcomed our reports and took them 
    in the spirit they were meant. It is because of our faith in the democratic 
    potential in the South and in the good sense of the Sinhalese and Muslim people 
    at large, that we have no hesitation in being frank about the hypocrisy, opportunism 
    and destructiveness that prevails among leading sections of the Tamil community. 
    These sections are ultimately the most harmful to their own people.&nbsp; 
    They had a choice, unlike the LTTE leadership who had burnt their boats. Without 
    the aid of these sections, the LTTE would have been a disembodied organism. 
    Among their greatest achievements is to have a good part of the world believe 
    that there is a liberation struggle going on in the North-East; whereas the 
    shameful reality is that on the one hand the children are being deliberately 
    conditioned to fight and die for a lie, while the others, particularly the 
    vocal supporters of this cause, have sought safety. These sections today have 
    the temerity to desecrate universities in the west by holding intellectual 
    conferences to promote the LTTE as a liberator, while on the ground children, 
    women and men are being forced to undergo LTTE training to receive government 
    rations.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><font color="#990000">In trying to find space for the people, these sections 
    within Tamil society need to be exposed, along with their counterparts in 
    the South. Both play complementary roles in sustaining the conflict, and in 
    stifling any breathing space for democratic accountability.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><font color="#990000">It is also a sad reflection on the part of the Sinhalese 
    community that even after a prolonged and gruesome war, which is destroying 
    the very basis of society, there are even today intellectuals and politicians 
    who are unable to come out of their blinkered view of Sri Lankan history. 
    The total failure of the nation building process as well as how the Sri Lankan 
    state steadily lost its legitimacy among the Tamil people by its partisan 
    intolerance, is after all so obvious to everyone else. Even the Sinhalese 
    dominated Army sent to counter the rebellion of the Tamil youth in the North 
    – East, think and act as though they are in an alien land. This itself brings 
    out the truth. It is in sharp contrast to the situation in India, such as 
    in the case of Punjab. The success of the Indian State in reflecting the diverse 
    character of the society up to a level could also be attributed to the mass 
    mobilisation and the healthier approach of the Indian Congress led by Mahatma 
    Ghandi during the freedom struggle. Its legacy still maintains its momentum, 
    although in recent times India faces severe challenges on all fronts.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><font color="#990000">But the attainment of independence in Sri Lanka had 
    little do with mass mobilisation or any vibrant struggle. Hence when the British 
    colonial power left our shores, implanting a modern state formation in its 
    infancy, it soon become a tool of leading sections of the majority community, 
    leading to communal politics on both sides, as it became the easiest means 
    to get votes in the parliamentary system.&nbsp; The rest is history!</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><font color="#990000">Thus Sri Lanka had failed dismally in its endeavour 
    to build a national identity following independence and the state has alienated 
    the minorities and made them insecure on several fronts. This is self-evident 
    to anyone who seriously thinks about the future generation and its well-being.&nbsp; 
    To deny this and to go on burning night oil in proving that the Tamils have 
    a hidden agenda and that there is no need for a fresh start and new political 
    arrangement to give confidence to the Tamils as well as the other minorities, 
    is symptomatic of the perverted mindset of some intellectuals. Although they 
    are a handful and do not reflect the ordinary people’s interest or their desire 
    for peace, they have easy access to the media in promoting their ideas. It 
    in turn reinforces the fear of the Tamils that nothing is going to come out 
    of the South which would give them political space to express their identity.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><font color="#990000">On the other hand, if we go beyond the dominant media 
    propaganda and analyse the people’s feelings, fears, and their experience, 
    we see there much potential for peace in this land. This is true on both sides 
    of the communal divide. On that basis, what we have consistently advocated 
    is for all those concerned with peace and democracy to prevail on the Government 
    to strictly enforce observance of basic human rights even under the trying 
    conditions of war, and to move decisively to remedy the underlying causes 
    of political grievances among the Tamils. The present government’s moves in 
    this direction are yet to enter anything like a decisive stage. Given this 
    situation, the normal effects of war on the civilians are enough for the LTTE 
    and its world-wide allies in influential positions to sustain and justify 
    their cause.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><b><font color="#990000">Keeping the Political Initiative at the Forefront</font></b><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><font color="#990000">In this connection we need to correct some instances 
    where our reports have been quoted in a manner that distorts our message, 
    conveying an impression that is less than fair by us. In the Foreword to `A 
    Tamil Heroine Unmourned’ our criticism of the UNP’s and TULF’s call for unconditional 
    talks with the LTTE was based primarily on the grounds that the demand was 
    not seriously meant, besides being irresponsible and opportunistic.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><font color="#990000">On the part of the TULF it deep down knows the character 
    of the LTTE and the immense damage it is doing to the Tamil community. But 
    it never challenges them politically, always trying to play safe thinking 
    that eventually some one will destroy it for them to be in politics. On the 
    other hand they never touch the crucial issues which affect the Tamil community, 
    such as child recruitment, the brutal internal violence to suppress dissent 
    and other evils. If the TULF is serious in demanding that Government should 
    talk to the LTTE without conditions, they as the chief Tamil parliamentary 
    party must give some reassurance that they would take some responsibility 
    for the process and play a role to make the LTTE&nbsp; represent people’s 
    interest during the process. Without addressing these questions, the TULF’s 
    call is simply a political ploy to avoid the serious issues concerning peace 
    and their own role in Tamil society.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><font color="#990000">In the case of the UNP the demand for talks between 
    the Government and the LTTE is purely a means to cover up its lack of commitment 
    and its failure to engage constructively in the Government’s attempt to clear 
    the political hurdles towards ending the conflict. The leader of the party 
    uttered various things to various audiences and even went to the extent of 
    saying at one point that the UNP is for anti-symmetric devolution, and that 
    for the North–East they were prepared go beyond the present package. Recently 
    the UNP leader has been saying that the package is too much and that his party 
    will not be able to support it in its present form. As a programme for negotiating 
    with the LTTE one could see the hypocrisy and absurdity of this position. 
    Hence its advocacy of talks with the LTTE are baseless.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><font color="#990000">Our own position has little to do with `[militarily] 
    crushing the LTTE forthwith’ that is imputed in the use of our report by `Citizen 
    D’ in the Island (13th November 1998). The advocates of this line have learnt 
    nothing form its dismal failure for over 20 years with no end in sight. They 
    have to take refuge behind contending that the `crushing’ line has not been 
    tried hard enough or ruthlessly enough.</font><b><font color="#990000"></font></b> 
  <p><b><font color="#990000">The Mainsprings of War</font></b><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><font color="#990000">Thus the continuance of the war and its accompanying 
    misery has two mainsprings. One is the lack of a sense of urgency over the 
    political settlement and measures for redress by the Government and civil 
    society in the South. The other is the combination of silence, fatal opportunism 
    and dissimulation on the part of Tamil society, particularly at the higher 
    levels. For the present there is little hope from this quarter until there 
    is sufficient movement in the South, such as would give hope and demolish 
    the mischievous canard about the `Sinhalese State’ being the `Ultimate Enemy’. 
    Clearly, it was far from enough for the Government to be talking about the 
    political settlement for four years, while the daily experience of the Tamils 
    in a climate of continuing conflict provides fertile ground for propaganda 
    about the `Ultimate Enemy’.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><font color="#990000">It is this unsettled political climate which greatly 
    helps an organisation like LTTE to get away with its present methods of terror, 
    elimination and virtual press-ganging of the impressionable young. As long 
    as the Government’s primary concern is with the war, it would find it hard 
    to match the LTTE. A democratic government cannot recruit the way the LTTE 
    does and carry on with impunity. Not only would it lead again to further dehumanisation 
    of the society and the destruction of the remaining vestiges of Southern civil 
    society, as it had happened in the North-East.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><font color="#990000">Our main thrust has always been to openly challenge 
    the trends that brought tragedy to our community, and not to cover up the 
    reality of the Tamil community and glorify its violence in order to promote 
    the continuing tragedy. It is ironical that the very thing we are fighting 
    against is being promoted in South by quoting our reports. We argued always 
    that the main thrust from the South must necessarily be political.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><font color="#990000">Among the Tamils, there are many in this country who 
    have a clear vision and the long term interests of the Tamils at heart. Despite 
    all the negative signals from the South and omissions and commissions of the 
    Government, they are clear that the politics of the LTTE can never deliver 
    anything meaningful and healthy to the Tamils. Moreover they understand that 
    the deeds of the LTTE further enhance and reinforce the ultra-nationalist 
    elements in the South, so delaying any prospect of peace. But their opinions 
    are being suppressed by the terror of the LTTE and the narrow nationalist 
    ideological milieu now prevailing in the Tamil media.&nbsp; Hence any analysis 
    of the LTTE, its politics, and the nature of Tamil political life is suppressed 
    in the Tamil media. Moreover, when individuals point this out in other fora 
    they are subtly campaigned against as quislings using Sinhalese owned media 
    or State media, thus in effect suppressing the issues.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><font color="#990000">In this kind of political and social environment the 
    ordinary people with various doubts and anxieties are forced to keep their 
    views to themselves. They can only repeat standard clich&eacute;s dished out 
    by the so called opinion makers in the media as a form of escapism. Such are 
    for example that negotiations should be held only on the basis of the ‘Thimpu 
    principles’.&nbsp; Therefore those who are deeply anguished about the nature 
    of things in Tamil society continue to be isolated and their voices will continue 
    to be strangled unless there comes a decisive change in the southern political 
    landscape, which can be clearly seen by the ordinary Tamil people as representing 
    a change of heart among the majority. Only then can the Tamil people say with 
    assurance that there is an alternative, and there is absolutely no rationale 
    for destroying a generation of youth to feed a cause of opportunists and megalomaniacs. 
    In turn the LTTE and other political actors who take shelter under nationalist 
    ideology and rhetoric to cover-up their bankruptcy would find themselves in 
    serious difficulty.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><font color="#990000">Hence, by avoiding seeing the complex reality in which 
    ordinary people are trapped, many, by asking simple questions such as how 
    is a political package is going to solve the problem and whether LTTE will 
    accept it, argue for total military solution. This further corners the ordinary 
    people into LTTE’s trap. On the other hand the major task of the State is 
    to regain its lost legitimacy among the Tamils. For this, those in the south 
    need to go beyond discussing the nature of the LTTE and its actions alone. 
    When that happens, they will also acquire a moral right to challenge the Tamils 
    and make them play a more positive role in building peace and to make a new 
    beginning. Instead, quarrelling over the right amount of food for civilians 
    in the Vanni and putting up unnecessary bureaucratic structures, such as cumbersome 
    pass systems, in every sphere of the ordinary people’s life are signs that 
    the Government is on the wrong track. The people know that the LTTE takes 
    away food by the truckloads irrespective of what the people get. With a few 
    thousands of rupees changing hands the whole string of bureaucratic hurdles 
    could be overcome and finally only the innocent and the poor suffer. Hence, 
    the Government politically loses much by being seen to be callous and vindictive.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><font color="#990000">As we said earlier, apart from duplicity within the 
    Tamil community, owing to the dominant political mores there has always been 
    a vocal section within the Sinhalese community who have been prime movers 
    behind violence and intolerance. The chief beneficiaries of their work in 
    ruling out any political accommodation by simply denying that there is an 
    ethnic problem, are the merchants and shadowy interests spawned by war. Although 
    they need to be challenged as much as their counterparts within the Tamil 
    community, it has not been our primary concern.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><font color="#990000">The reasons are two fold. Firstly there is a total 
    silence and lack of transparency that has been imposed on the Tamil community 
    from within. So that trying to tell this aspect the truth on behalf of all 
    those who want an end to the war has been a demanding task by itself. Secondly 
    the task of challenging the chauvinist lobby in the South is now being done 
    quite ably by people there. Moreover like-minded groups in the South have 
    both used and publicised in Sinhalese our reporting of violations by the State 
    in the North-East, while we have been largely shut out by the Tamil press. 
    On the other hand when we were almost alone in documenting and publicising 
    the massive violations by the State in the early 90s, our material was considered 
    too hot for the press under the prevailing climate of fear in Colombo, where 
    falling foul of the State and the mixed bag of paramilitary groups continued 
    to be dangerous</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><font color="#990000">It is a paradoxical situation which we are in. That 
    is, when we challenge certain values and political trends in our community 
    which are detrimental to the interests of the people, our writings are at 
    times used to attack those in the South who similarly challenge chauvinist 
    ideology while trying to expose the root causes of intolerance and bigotry. 
    On the other hand arguments that our criticisms of Tamil politics are being 
    used by the State are used to adduce that we are working for the State. This 
    was an issue we were continuously faced with. Our answer has always been that 
    short-term political thinking based on strategies and tactics has no meaning 
    when dealing with malignant phenomena such as fascist formations. We believe 
    that in the long run our work can bring some sanity back to the community, 
    and it is this that is crucial for both the community and us. When basic values 
    of humanity are in crisis, talking about tactical and strategical manipulations 
    and their implications becomes a shameful ploy to avoid facing the present 
    tragedy squarely and responsibly. This is morally indefensible!</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><font color="#990000">Because of the complex situation which the LTTE manipulates 
    and thrives in, we had to raise issues with individuals and organisations 
    who, although raising issues regarding negative aspects of the Sinhalese polity 
    are sometimes unable to understand, or when they do, try to avoid implications 
    arising out of the singular nature of the LTTE. This arises from two reasons. 
    Being Sinhalese and feeling guilty for what had happened in the past, they 
    feel shy to question the Tamil side. This is understandable. Secondly, once 
    one begins to understand the nature of the LTTE and its dynamism, it becomes 
    difficult to formulate a strategy for peace. And so they skirt this dilemma 
    and campaign for peace with catchy slogans such as asking the Government to 
    stop the war.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><font color="#990000">Then there is also a small section in the South with 
    legitimate anger against the State and the Southern polity. Being unable to 
    challenge the latter with their political outlook, they feel good when forces 
    like LTTE challenge them in a very destructive manner. These egocentric attitudes 
    are transient phenomena. For, we have seen several individuals in the South 
    whose views on the Tamil Nation’s Right of Self Determination was so strident 
    that they even attacked as traitors and renegade Marxists, Tamil activists 
    who were questioning the cry for Eelam. In a matter of few years they became 
    advisors and torchbearers of VIPs in the Southern political establishment. 
    These impermanent revolutionaries have no sense of values regarding the core 
    of the Marxist agenda, which is human emancipation, as we understand it.&nbsp; 
    For them all Marxist jargon are tools for their `emancipation’ from obscurity 
    to fame and to cover up their political ambitions.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><font color="#990000">Similarly there are Tamils who had challenged the narrow 
    nationalism in the early days of the militant struggle, who have now transformed 
    themselves into champions of the so called principle of self-determination, 
    by ignoring the fact that the whole society at present is trapped in a fascist 
    grip. By playing safe and indirectly legitimising the LTTE’s destructive politics 
    they do more harm to the Tamil community than anyone else. These types of 
    people easily manipulate the progressive sections with a guilty conscience 
    in the South and others who want token Tamil representation in their movement 
    or organisation.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><b><font color="#990000">The specific character of the LTTE</font></b><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><font color="#990000">The LTTE prostrated the whole community to a point 
    where without much protest it was able to ban all other organisations and 
    also close all democratic space. This is in contrast to situations in other 
    countries, where it happened not during the process of the struggle, but after, 
    during the competition for state power.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><font color="#990000">We certainly believe that the LTTE as a totalitarian 
    phenomenon in a context where the remnants of civil society have abdicated, 
    must be exposed and decisively defeated politically. The history of misgovernment 
    and the disproportionate publicity given to intransigent opinions on both 
    sides has made this task difficult by creating confusion about the true nature 
    of the LTTE. We had also stated before that merely calling upon the Government, 
    as some Tamil parties, Southern peace groups and political groups do, to stop 
    the war and talk to the LTTE is meaningless. Such calls may seem&nbsp; `politically 
    right’ by not taking into account the nature of LTTE, the predicament of the 
    Tamil people, the character of Tamil society at this juncture and, more importantly, 
    our own responsibility to ensure at the same time that these talks lead to 
    a permanent peace.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><font color="#990000">The fact of the matter is that the total paralysis 
    of society made ordinary Tamil people powerless, and thus unable to have any 
    serious impact on the LTTE. Every time when there were peace talks most of 
    them hoped that something would come out. At the same time they knew at the 
    back of their mind that it was wishful thinking on their part as they had 
    repeatedly experienced the tell-tale signs from the LTTE’s conduct at ground 
    level. When invariably the LTTE restarted the war and plunged the community 
    into unwanted violence again, there was no prospect of their having even a 
    small gathering in the North-East to protest against it. That is the reality 
    regarding prospects for genuine peace activity among the Tamils.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><font color="#990000">Even armed groups elsewhere, which had totalitarian 
    tendencies, and were fighting for causes, generally had inhibitions against 
    overtly claiming for themselves the status of sole representatives. Due to 
    this social reality they never succeeded in totally paralysing the community. 
    Indirectly this provided much space for the people to evaluate their predicament. 
    Despite several community leaders being under threat of violence, the IRA 
    could not control the whole civil society. This was evident whenever there 
    were acts of violence perpetrated by the IRA against civilian targets. The 
    churches and other civil organisations, as well as democratic parties among 
    the Catholic community, were able to voice their outrage and even mobilise 
    the people to protest. Of course there was a sizeable section of the people 
    who were sympathetic to the IRA as it articulated the gut feeling of a community 
    which was feeling insecure and experiencing overt discrimination. Moreover, 
    there was some space for political activity within the IRA, which allowed 
    the political wing to influence the direction of movement and to reflect the 
    mood of the people.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><font color="#990000">By banning or indirectly assimilating all sections 
    of society, the LTTE has forced the remaining political groups to do survival 
    politics with out any principle or purpose. In most of the other former Tamil 
    militant organisations, the healthier elements have left and only the degenerate 
    elements continue functioning with a very dubious political agenda.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><font color="#990000">The extra-ordinary violent history of the LTTE, based 
    on the role of the Leader as Superman and its motto `the thirst of the Tigers 
    is for the Thamil Eeela motherland’ needs to be understood in depth. The suicidal 
    cult centred around the Leader and its ramifications have never been studied 
    properly. Tamil society is not so isolated from the outside world as to have 
    only very brutish, simple and unsophisticated options. On the contrary it 
    is a society dominated by a cosmopolitan middle class, which is very much 
    alive to all avenues available in the international arena. How then was it 
    possible for a movement of the nature of the LTTE to come to dominance, recruit 
    children and youths in their thousands and send them on a suicidal course 
    with impunity? This is where the political character of the society at present 
    needs to be grasped. Indeed, external conditions (such as state oppression 
    and insecurity) were creating conditions for a nationalist struggle. But the 
    causes for the form it took and how it transformed the whole society and its 
    values need to be sought in internal factors governing modern Tamil society. 
    These values plummeted to a level where hypocrisy and duplicity became the 
    order of the day for many who pay lip service to the Tamil cause, while prompting 
    large vulnerable sections to destroy themselves in the pyre of suicidal nationalism.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><font color="#990000">Unfortunately, the fascist characteristics, revealed, 
    clearly may be difficult to grasp, as the LTTE has not quite taken on a state 
    formation. We may at this point recall what we said in a statement issued 
    immediately after the LTTE breached the cease-fire in1994 (The Renewal of 
    Hostilities: Keeping Issues in Perspective-A Statement with an Appeal: 8th 
    May1995):</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><font color="#990000">….. A clear distinction needs to be drawn between the 
    problem of the Tamils and the LTTE. The first needs to be addressed politically. 
    The latter’s emotional and irrational nature needs to be understood to grasp 
    its dynamism. It's haunted past of murder and paranoia, invariably combined 
    with its destructive course, has led to a situation where its isolated actions 
    cannot be explained rationally. This has been the case historically, and for 
    the Tamil community it has been both suicidal and ruinous.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><font color="#990000">&nbsp;Although the LTTE expressed a highly dramatised 
    concern regarding deprivations affecting the day to day life of the Tamil 
    people, they have shown total contempt for the latter's well-being and have 
    used them as tools for their destructive brand of politics. The decision to 
    embark on war when an overwhelmingly large section of the people yearns for 
    peace, shows again the ingrained nature of the LTTE.</font> <br>
    <font color="#990000">&nbsp;</font> <br>
    <font color="#990000">&nbsp; Its dehumanising politics that covers its crimes 
    by rhetorically proclaiming the sanctity of the organisation could give meaning 
    only in death to the thousands of youth fatalistically moulded into its leadership 
    cult. It thus trapped itself into being accountable only to those cadres who 
    had sacrificed their lives, leaving behind comrades who feel, even more strongly, 
    that there is no meaning for them except to fight and die for Eelam. Consequently, 
    it lost the ability to think of the needs of the living, whether cadre or 
    people, except as sacrificial victims awaiting their turn. Hence it will singlemindedly 
    use every means, without inhibition, in an attempt to achieve that aim. But 
    it has very little prospect of stabilising itself whether in a local, regional 
    or a global context. Therefore the LTTE has been most afraid for itself whenever 
    there was a political drift holding out the restoration of accountability 
    to the Tamil people, and on every such occasion it has stolen the initiative 
    by a resort to precipitate violence…</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><font color="#990000">Furthermore the military machinery the LTTE has built 
    up with its international network, resulting in the destructive power the 
    Leader has gained for conjuring up cheap human bombs in a purposefully paralysed 
    society, gives a grandiose illusion of power. The yardstick, which we use 
    in analysing normal individuals, often lead to wrong conclusions. Every individual 
    has an ego, hunger for power, selfish as well as selfless motivations and 
    several emotional needs. But many other factors determine which traits dominate 
    in an&nbsp; individual’s behavioural pattern. Inhibitions due to the fear-instinct, 
    social and moral values, and how society will react, all play a constraining 
    role. Hence inhibitions have positive as well as negative effects. But a person 
    who overtly portrays himself as the Leader of a whole community, asking many 
    to swear oaths by him to commit suicide on being ordered, spurning normal 
    inhibitions, cannot be analysed with a normal yardstick. It is not a question 
    of the genuineness of the Leader or his cadre. It is about the community’s 
    responsibility in abdicating its future to an individual in a manner obtaining 
    among Tamils. It says a great deal about the nature of such a community and 
    its politics during that period of time. It is also a challenge for all who 
    are concerned about humanity. Shrugging it off as the Tamil community’s problem 
    as many well-meaning people in the South do, is a sign of&nbsp; mistaken altruism.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><font color="#990000">We are bringing out these facts here to point out the 
    reality and to show how complicated it is. At one level we see total arrogance 
    in some quarters of the Sinhalese polity, treating the entire problem as a 
    terrorist one, conveniently ignoring their role in creating a Frankenstein. 
    This was done through degrading another community by subjecting its members 
    to insecurity and hopelessness. At another level there is total disregard 
    for the true nature of the dominant theme in Tamil political life by some 
    influential sections of the peace lobby. This condemns the Tamils to a violent 
    and insecure ghetto. Where the second trend is concerned, although we appreciate 
    their problems, we cannot justify their inability to be creative in dealing 
    with a specific reality that has been with us too long to feign ignorance 
    of.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><font color="#990000">This is where many cross the thin line that exists 
    between explaining a phenomenon and justifying it.&nbsp; When we become involved 
    in social action these issues become very important. Analysing ethnic issues 
    purely as an academic exercise often helps us to see certain critical factors. 
    At the same time it leads several people to lose sight of grasping the essential 
    social dynamism. Without understanding the pathological social factors, the 
    LTTE would remain incomprehensible.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><font color="#990000">For example we in our reports cited several incidents 
    where military personnel had behaved well and recorded our appreciation. Intellectuals 
    concerned about structural analysis ask us if we are so blind to the nature 
    of the State where individuals play necessarily an insignificant role. We 
    are thereby accused of missing&nbsp; the wood&nbsp; for the trees. This does 
    not arise from our ignorance of the role of institutions. But we are also 
    aware of certain realities in which people function. As we started documenting 
    events and what was behind them, we came across a clear pattern. That is, 
    quite apart from the nature of the State and its actions, we saw the calculated 
    acts of the LTTE which wants its own people killed and massacred to further 
    its cause. The people were repeatedly left at the mercy of soldiers without 
    any organised structures for their protection.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><font color="#990000">In 1990, when the war broke out in the East, Thirukkovil 
    was placed between an army column moving from the north and an STF column 
    moving from the south. Some prominent citizens from Thirukovil sensing what 
    was in store after talking to the commander of the army column, quickly approached 
    the STF and asked them to come to their village. [Rep N0 4,1990].&nbsp; Do 
    try to understand the plight of the people. The LTTE suddenly started the 
    war on flimsy grounds to do with a minor incident concerning a tailor in Batticaloa 
    and some army personnel.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><font color="#990000">Immediately thy surrounded many police stations and 
    asked the policemen to surrender.&nbsp; President Premadasa even ordered them 
    to surrender. After disarming them, the LTTE killed all the Sinhalese and 
    Muslim policemen at Rufus Kulam west of Thirukkovil. The Tamil policemen were 
    beaten and chased off - many of them to be killed by the security forces later 
    when they tried to report for work. The LTTE followed the killing of scores 
    of Muslim policemen from the area by abducting and killing Muslim civilians 
    at Kurukkal Madam. The civilians were in a convoy of vehicles returning to 
    Kattankudy. At this point the Muslim traders at Kattankudy were the only structure 
    providing a lifeline to the Tamils otherwise cut off. Then followed the LTTE’s 
    massacres of Muslims at Kattnakudy and Eravur. Where these actions placed 
    the Tamils needs no elaboration. It was deliberate.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><font color="#990000">The LTTE were doing all these things in the process 
    of withdrawing from urban centres in the East. All these acts were calculated 
    provocations well knowing the vulnerability of the Tamil community. What was 
    the Tamil community left with? Did they have any organised structures to defend 
    their dignity or to handle intra and inter -community relations? Nothing!</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><font color="#990000">The people in Thirukovil out of fear and insecurity 
    decided to approach the STF, simply because it was earlier stationed in their 
    village and they knew some officers who in turn gave them temporary reassurance.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><font color="#990000">After reading the chauvinistic material dished out 
    regularly in a good section of the Southern media by so called learned intellectuals 
    who represent&nbsp; the others as horrendous outsiders, the average man in 
    uniform carrying a powerful weapon is left feeling very insecure in alien 
    surroundings. When the LTTE provokes him in a manner calculated to take away 
    all restraint, and he is still able to constrain himself and not lose his 
    humanity, we should value him and this potential needs to be tapped in order 
    to restore peace in this country. Peace means creating conditions where all 
    communities could live in this island with self-respect and dignity. For that 
    purpose any positive change in the character of the State is to be commended 
    and should be welcomed.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><font color="#990000">We had also come across many army personnel who are 
    trying to understand their role and are beginning to grasp the problem more 
    clearly than the many so called `Patriots’ whose copious writings plant venom 
    into future generations on both sides.</font> <br>
    <font color="#990000">The Tamils have been placed in such a unique position 
    by the LTTE, that merely recording human rights violations without showing 
    appreciation for security officials who rise significantly above the average 
    human level, becomes a barren exercise.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><b><font color="#990000">Siamese Twins</font></b><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><font color="#990000">We certainly do not underestimate the huge task in 
    the South resulting from partisan state ideology, reinforced by playing on 
    the fears of the Sinhalese. If one is clear about the lack of political substance 
    and the political vulnerability of the LTTE, as offering the people nothing 
    tangibly human, then how to deal with it flows naturally. But in building 
    up the LTTE’s image as something formidable, the advocates of militarism in 
    the South and their counterparts among the Tamils have been complementing 
    each other. They have been jointly playing at a game of `Emperor’s New Clothes’ 
    with the LTTE.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><font color="#990000">How the two parties need each other like Siamese twins 
    is evident from the fact that the articles of those like Nalin de Silva who 
    maintain that there is no Tamil problem, but only a terrorist problem, were 
    regularly translated from the Sinhalese or the English and publicised in the 
    LTTE controlled media. On the other hand the advocates of the ‘no Tamil problem’ 
    position in the South cover up their bankruptcy by giving publicity to defenders 
    of the LTTE. By covering up for the crimes of the LTTE and identifying it 
    with Tamil aspirations, those like Kumar Ponnambalam make the cause of the 
    Tamils who have suffered a history of state oppression look novel, absurd 
    and utterly unreasonable.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><font color="#990000">How close the two groups of pretended adversaries are 
    is also revealed by the fact that they agree on some key suppositions and 
    their approach to history and interpretations of events are very similar. 
    It is for example important for both of them to maintain that the Sinhalese 
    and Tamils have been distinct ethnic groups from time immemorial, almost fated 
    to be bitter adversaries in perpetuity. Each one of the two imposes an unchanging 
    core of evil intentions to the other.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><font color="#990000">Their use of history too shows how each corners itself 
    into a position of belligerence. There are just about two kinds of Tamils 
    who occur in Nalin de Silva’s writings. Both are racists, with supposedly 
    fictitious political grievances. One is of the moderate kind who seek a separate 
    state through first getting federalism. The other kind seek it directly through 
    violence. The drift of his mind is clear from the following taken from his 
    recent articles in the Island:</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><font color="#990000">“The Tamil racists would very much like to erase the 
    Dutugemunu-Elara story from the history books, as it is the cornerstone of 
    the formation of the Sinhala –Buddhist unitary state of this country.”(28.10.98)</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><font color="#990000">“[Dutugemunu’s] aim was very clear. Defeat the invader 
    completely and protect the Buddha Sasana. No so-called political solutions, 
    no peace talks with or without conditions…” (7.10.98)</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><font color="#990000">Dr. de Silva is quick to take issue with any scholar 
    who suggests that these events of circa 100 BC were part of a feudal power 
    game that were given an ideological twist by the Buddhist clerics who recorded 
    them about 700 years later, so as to enhance the legitimacy of the royal line 
    to which they were allied.&nbsp; More particularly, he fervently rejects any 
    suggestion of diversity or pluralism in this country in early historic times, 
    such as would challenge the early provenance of his monolithic Sinhalese–Buddhist 
    unitary state. A corollary to this line of reasoning is that the Tamils can 
    have no grievances or legitimate political claims because they were invaders 
    or even destroyers. Legitimate rights are historical rights!</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><font color="#990000">A key feature of such reasoning is `argument from silence’ 
    – from the absence of records to the contrary. For example Nalin de Silva 
    argues that there could have been no settled Tamil presence in this country 
    in 100 BC because there are no records that suggest to him that there was 
    a tribe called the Tamils anywhere in the world then. How misleading such 
    an argument could be is not hard to see. Nothing survives of anything that 
    was written in or about Britain before the Roman conquest in 55 BC. Moreover 
    there were hardly any records in Britain other than in Latin - the language 
    of the ancient Romans– until the 16th century AD. We know of nothing that 
    is recognisably English from before the 10th century AD. But no one suggests 
    that modern Englishmen in England should be looked upon as invaders. History 
    is a complex phenomenon involving a constant flux people, ideas and influences.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><font color="#990000">Ideas such as those of the ancient unitary state in 
    Sri Lanka protecting the Buddha Sasana are not just dogmatic history, but 
    are totalitarian in character. It is similar to the ideology of England as 
    the `New Jerusalem’ (Dhamma Dipa) conceived among the English gentry around 
    1650, after effectively suppressing the underclass that was clamouring for 
    radical reform. Such ideologies are typically those of a ruling class which 
    feels beleaguered from within.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><font color="#990000">Such lines of thinking which deny the existence of 
    genuine political grievances among the Tamils today, have to dwell in myths, 
    both ancient and modern, and fail to understand present issues reflecting 
    the modern social and political reality.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><font color="#990000">Counterposed to those who stand by a cast iron Sinhalese 
    unitary state are the mystifiers who promote the LTTE.&nbsp; Some of them 
    who have scoured the early Tamil epics have come up with exciting stuff. The 
    Tigers are said to be in effect a re-incarnation of the ancient Chera whose 
    armies advanced to the Himalayas and the Cholas who conquered the Ganges basin. 
    From these same sources rationalisations have also been found for suicide 
    warriors and martial women. Just as the ancient unitary state myth has no 
    bearing on today’s problems, these myths which tease the vanity of elite and 
    expatriate Tamil nationalists, have no relation to what is in the mind of 
    an ordinary LTTE cadre, or to the disposition of longsuffering Tamil people 
    desperate for peace and a chance to live as human beings.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><font color="#990000">A more sophisticated attempt at constructing a myth 
    was put forward in the Weekend Express (5.12.98) by E.A.V. Naganathan in response 
    to our `A Tamil Heroine Unmourned….’&nbsp; He completely evades the moral 
    questions posed by us regarding the LTTE’s methods and implications for the 
    peace. He suggests a parallel with Vichy France under the overlordship of 
    Nazi Germany, with Mrs.Yogeswaran in the role of Marshal Petain. She was, 
    one understands from Naganathan, in the role of a&nbsp; `collaborationist’, 
    in a situation where` the Geneva Convention rules do not apply to belligerents 
    on the `rebel’ side.’</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><font color="#990000">These suggestions are preceded by a factual account 
    of the violence and progressive marginalisation the Tamils had experienced 
    from the State. It is implied that against this base systematic conspiracy 
    by Sinhalese leaders, the `integrity and lofty gentlemanly qualities’ of the 
    Tamil leadership were of no avail. In posing this as a question at the end 
    (what avail?) a strong implication is left about the role of the LTTE.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><font color="#990000">The same position is shard by those like Nalin de Silva 
    except that the actors are reversed. Should it come as any surprise that Naganathan 
    should find the observation “Tiger terrorism is Tamil Terrorism” attributed 
    to Kamalika Pieris, usefully `perspicuous’?</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><font color="#990000">Our analysis of developments has always been that there 
    never was, nor is, a conspiracy among either the Sinhalese masses or the Tamil 
    masses. Political leaders on both sides made capital out of the politics of 
    attributed conspiracy and all the people suffered in different ways. True, 
    in a sense the politics was gentlemanly. The elite leaders on both sides for 
    the most part had excellent personal relations and socialised in Colombo. 
    But their politics, on both sides, acquired a vested interest in keeping the 
    ordinary Tamil and Sinhalese people divided, while believing in the essential 
    evilness of the other. Anyone challenging this preconception became a `traitor’ 
    – a term popularised from gentlemanly Federal Party platforms and its propaganda 
    sheet, the&nbsp; `Suthanthiran’. Coming from this frame of mind, Naganathan’s 
    feelings about the Tigers are logical. The politics of the Tigers is a continuation 
    of the same, even after the consequences of the TC-FP-TULF legacy have become 
    repellingly evident.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><font color="#990000">The experiences over the last fifteen years involving 
    the Muslims who were chased out of the North en-masse at four hours notice, 
    the massacres of Muslim and Sinhalese civilians, and thousands of Tamil youths 
    imprisoned and tortured to death by their fellows, also have an important 
    impact on the present political dynamism. But these tragedies and the character 
    of the politics which perpetuates these crimes, evade these gentlemen whose 
    consciences are frozen and suffer from selective amnesia, as do their counterparts 
    among the Sinhalese.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><font color="#990000">In order to deceive the children of others and send 
    them into horrifying deaths, the Tamil establishment and their media need 
    to constantly falsify the true disposition of the Sinhalese people, turn them 
    into ogres and continually belittle Sinhalese individuals whose public role 
    offers hope.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><font color="#990000">The parallel with Vichy France is utterly inappropriate. 
    To begin with it would suggest that the relationship of Sarojini Yogeswaran 
    to Chandrika Kumartunga was similar to that between Petain and Adolf Hiltler. 
    It shows how absurd parallels are drawn to justify cast iron preconceptions 
    and turn a blind eye to where the LTTE is leading the people. An analysis 
    to the effect that the communalism of the Sri Lankan State caused the problem 
    and that there is little hope in the Southern polity solving the problem, 
    is defensible. Few would contest the first proposition. The second may be 
    treated as a debatable proposition or a challenge for political action. But 
    from this one cannot jump to the conclusion that the LTTE is the answer or 
    that any responsible Tamil could take a morally neutral position as regards 
    the LTTE.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><font color="#990000">Vichy France too had its rationalisations, which implied 
    moral compromises. The latter included throwing French Jews to the Nazi wolves. 
    The situation has some resemblance to Jaffna under LTTE rule when dissidents 
    were rounded up by the thousands, and many of whom were killed. Whenever the 
    state forces were responsible for violations, the people were not forced into 
    such abject and far-reaching moral compromises.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><font color="#990000">Here again we encounter the deviousness of the LTTE 
    as a social phenomenon. The LTTE would not own up to killing Sarojini Yogeswaran, 
    and if pressed, is likely to deny it. But then several Tamils feel impelled 
    to come forward and explain or justify the killing – even while rhetorically 
    disapproving it - on the presumption that the LTTE was the culprit. In this 
    climate of evasion, the international organisations, which operate within 
    a rigid legal framework, fail to put their finger on anything tangible where 
    the LTTE is concerned.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><font color="#990000">The concept of a Tamil traditional homeland is another 
    topic now being debated with much vigour. To us the present argument over 
    history is largely meaningless. What is meaningful is to understand and remedy 
    recent historical trends which created conditions for a section of the people 
    to feel that the North – East is their homeland. Anyone studying the modern 
    history with an objective mind will easily understand how the Tamils began 
    to feel and to cling on to the North-East as their homeland as a place where 
    they could be free of violence to say the least. The political process which 
    reflected and harnessed that fear and insecurity took the form of the Tamil 
    nationalist struggle. This in turn led to various arguments and agendas, and 
    also created myths and new political concepts. In Tamil society too there 
    are no doubt various formations, regional differences and interests. But it 
    is the overwhelming strength of the perceived threat from the Sri Lankan State 
    which gave vitality to the homeland concept in the political agenda. It will 
    no doubt lose its importance when there are concrete moves towards peace through 
    removing that&nbsp; fear. This would also involve transforming the political 
    landscape and the character of the State to address the present reality.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><font color="#990000">&nbsp;The formation of a nation could therefore happen 
    for reasons quite apart from demands for the intrinsic rights of a pre-existing 
    group. Group feeling and solidarity are themselves dynamic phenomena – often 
    a response to perceived collective oppression.&nbsp; There may be certain 
    conditions conducive for the formation of a nation without necessarily leading 
    to separate nationhood. We pointed out earlier the internal factors which 
    created conditions for the Tamils to slowly and steadily fall back on nationalist 
    ideology. Often there are external factors such as happened in Bangladesh, 
    where the involvement India solidified certain demands rendering them achievable. 
    On the other hand the politics of Tamil society has shown its inability to 
    rise above differences, marshal a common programme, and so unify the Tamil 
    nationalist struggle into a coherent form. What we continue to see on both 
    sides are the same destructive tendencies after decades of repeated failure. 
    The LTTE which time and again made the same blunders is still able to hold 
    the Tamil people as hostages only due to the same unimaginative blunders being 
    made by the State and the Southern polity.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><font color="#990000">Without understanding the dynamism of concepts such 
    as nationhood and the basis for their vitality, if we merely attack them, 
    treating them as static or historically defined concepts, we only end up enhancing 
    them. Hence whether Eelam becomes a reality or not, depends very much on the 
    ability of the Southern political establishment to rise up to the occasion 
    and deal with the problem more creatively</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><font color="#990000">What extremists on both sides are doing to confuse 
    issues by painting the other ethnic group as uniformly subhuman, and amenable 
    only to brute force. Both continue to play their role in assuring the LTTE 
    with long life, while destroying the social and moral fabric of this country. 
    They are both enemies of peace and sanity and must be exposed as such.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><b><font color="#990000">Need for clarity on Negotiations:</font></b><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><font color="#990000">With peace-talks having once more become topical after 
    the LTTE leader’s apparent offer of third-party mediation and Balasingham 
    turning up in London, there is a need for greater clarity about issues. A 
    number of Tamils eager to sweep many moral problems under the carpet, had 
    very insincerely jumped to promote the Leader’s offer as genuine. A number 
    of persons have interpreted our stance as being against peace talks of any 
    kind. We have only been honest in saying on the basis of our understanding 
    of the LTTE’s inner nature and its accumulation of crimes flowing from this, 
    that it has ruled out any accommodation with peace as meaning a return to 
    basic human&nbsp; freedoms. But this does not mean that we rule out talks 
    with the LTTE.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><font color="#990000">What has after all been its recent record? The killing 
    of two elected mayors in Jaffna, an MP and several harmless and elderly local 
    councillors, a systematic targeting of political opponents, shooting down 
    a passenger flight deliberately and virtually abducting children for a war 
    the people desperately do not want. It is much easier for the Tamil elite 
    spokesmen to blame the Government and talk about the LTTE leader being genuine, 
    than to face up to these internal issues. The same old story is heard from 
    the LTTE Leader again – occupied areas, the Government having to solve the 
    day-to-day needs of the people and third party talks which were accepted and 
    spurned by him in 1995. In 1995 while giving the impression of wanting peace 
    to an international audience, the people of Jaffna were being told by the 
    LTTE that it was all eyewash. The same has happened in the Vanni after the 
    LTTE leader’s much publicised speech in late November. Karikalan, a senior 
    leader, reportedly told the people that the Leader’s speech was “ tactical”.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><font color="#990000">These circumstances make talking to the LTTE a paradoxical 
    exercise. There is also continual international pressure on the Government 
    to talk to the LTTE. But we as the people must urge talks not because the 
    LTTE wants peace, which it cannot, but because the people of this country 
    want peace. From this point of view, offers to mediate by persons of renown 
    must be treated as an opportunity. These offers could bear fruit only if we 
    use all means of pressure to ensure that the Government is seen to be adequately 
    clean. Only this could prevent much of the confusion that would arise when 
    talks are held with the LTTE.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><font color="#990000">On the other hand the Southern polity, especially the 
    PA and UNP, need to come to an understanding and put forward a common programme 
    to give confidence to the people that there is something meaningful on offer. 
    The present UNP’s stand on the matter is the worst possible way to deal with 
    the LTTE. The UNP wants the Government to accept the LTTE Leader’s apparent 
    offer to talk, while it has been very unhelpful about getting a political&nbsp; 
    package through.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><font color="#990000">Moreover, if the LTTE are serious about any political 
    solution through negotiation, they need to demand that both the PA and UNP 
    should come clean on a common framework to start negotiations. And the negotiations 
    should be primarily about the content of this framework rather than any other 
    issue.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><font color="#990000">Another important aspect which creates a lot of confusion 
    is the nature of Tamil society at the moment. Unless there is some democratic 
    space actively created during negotiations for the people to express their 
    opinions, the whole exercise would lead to a much worse situation. It is not 
    going to be an easy task. Whenever anyone tries to expand democratic space 
    for the Tamil people, there is going to be the cry of foul-play by the LTTE 
    and the peace lobbies. During the 1995 negotiations certain peace groups, 
    individuals and even the Bishop of Jaffna were crying foul, accusing the Government 
    of trying to create a gulf between the Tamil people and the LTTE. Such accusations 
    coming from Jaffna is not difficult to understand, knowing who was doing the 
    prompting there. But when a section of the peace lobby here did the same, 
    the overall confusion among peace activists becomes evident. If LTTE believes 
    that the people are behind them, then of course there is no need for them 
    to worry. They can overcome any strategic manipulation of the State by campaigning 
    against it, and educating the masses without a resort to intimidatory methods. 
    But we know the ruthlessness of the LTTE when it comes to any form of independent 
    activity. In this event, is it not important that the peace lobbies in the 
    South should to see this clearly and bring out the opinion of the silent majority 
    who are trapped there?</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><font color="#990000">To treat the LTTE as the sole representatives of the 
    Tamils in any manner would be counterproductive, both to the Tamils as well 
    as to the cause of peace. They have held out to the Tamils nothing but the 
    promise of doom and destruction. There is a problem of insecurity and alienation 
    faced by the Tamils requiring political redress. Leaving this in default would 
    allow the LTTE to steal the clothes of a liberation force. The liberation 
    struggle was over in 1986. A struggle where children of the underclass are 
    thrown to lions in the ring, while the others applaud from the sides, like 
    in a Roman circus, is a parody of a liberation struggle. It is a crime that 
    reflects badly on the whole society.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><font color="#990000">Hence any peace process needs to have built in strategies 
    to create space for people to express their opinions and assert themselves. 
    But the fear of the LTTE has been being internalised by the masses to such 
    an extent that the slightest whisper of `peace talks’ brings about the fear 
    that the LTTE is going to come back. This in turn produces a typical knee-jerk 
    reaction and the people become alert about doing anything `inappropriate’. 
    On the other hand there is also the question of the survival of the community. 
    The survival instinct in individuals brings about a predictable behavioural 
    pattern in a totalitarian formation. But when the danger is so severe that 
    the whole community’s survival is at stake, there comes a time where a few 
    individuals will withstand the terror and raise their voice. In recent times 
    we do see a few voices coming out from the Tamil establishment against extremist 
    violence. Hence it is important that the peace process should tap this potential. 
    But unfortunately the kind of peace processes we have been having, always 
    tend to drive the saner voices further into oblivion.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><font color="#990000">What is needed here can only be done by the peace movements. 
    We cannot expect the State to do that. Peace movements should understand the 
    long-term interest of the people in achieving lasting peace. This depends 
    on two things. The first is to work towards finding a political framework 
    which will remove insecurity and allow those who feel alienated due to their 
    ethnic affiliation to have political space. But more importantly it is essential 
    that the ideologies built around narrow nationalist perspectives be marginalised 
    on all sides. This alone will guarantee that any agreed formal arrangement 
    will lead to a lasting peace. We know that the different partisan ideologies 
    brought havoc to all. But they cannot be erased by simply campaigning against 
    them in isolation. That is why we need concrete political reforms to deal 
    with the existing reality. But it does not guarantee a new beginning unless 
    enlightened forces take responsibility for the future.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><font color="#990000">Today the intellectual as well as moral failures of 
    the peace lobbies and what were once the progressive sections have created 
    new dangers. Their simple slogans such as calling upon the Government to talk 
    to the LTTE without any reference to the democratic rights of the Tamil people, 
    or inviting the LTTE to join the Southern progressives and overthrow the capitalist 
    state, have failed to convince anyone. With declining conviction and seriousness, 
    these sections have fragmented, unable to put forward a common programme, 
    and unable to offer the people the leadership they seek. Instead, their slogans 
    seem to be addressed to a foreign audience, even making such fantastic claims 
    as Madhu having been a liberated area until the Army got there.</font> <br>
    <font color="#990000">By their default they have created space for groups 
    like the National Movement Against Terrorism and the Sinhala Vira Vidhana 
    which tap the uncertainly created among the Sinhalese by the politics of the 
    LTTE and its cohorts, Thus giving new life to ideas and slogans from the darkest 
    recesses of this country’s post – independence history. The obverse of this 
    is the injection of fresh vigour into the LTTE’s destructive mobilisation. 
    Surely, it is high time for those who stand for peace and humanity to make 
    a bold re-evaluation.</font> <br>
