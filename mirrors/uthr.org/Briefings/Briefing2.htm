    <b><span style='color:maroon'>&nbsp;The Beginnings</span></b> </p>
  <p style='margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in'><span style='color:maroon'>&nbsp; 
    From the inception of the UTHR(J), we have constantly documented the use of 
    children in violence, pointing out areas of concern. Our reports analysed 
    the degeneration of the politics that lay behind this development. A host 
    of studies in war zones around the world, including Jaffna, testify to traumatisation 
    and other extreme adverse effects on children resulting from the ravages of 
    war. This makes children even more vulnerable to propaganda, the content of 
    which they are, even under normal conditions, in no position to judge. The 
    use of children as tools of war, where they are manipulated and coerced into 
    being the unwitting and unwilling perpetrators of war's inevitable atrocities 
    and inhumanities, is therefore as pernicious as it is cynical. It can form 
    no part of a genuine liberation struggle. It would thus hardly come as a surprise 
    that the child recruits are drawn from the most vulnerable sections of society. 
    These child victims in turn brutalise an entire society beyond human endurance.</span> 
  </p>
  <p style='margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in'><span style='color:maroon'>&nbsp;The 
    first use of children in the North-East war surfaced during the mid-eighties 
    when various groups used them as sentries. These children were, sometimes,&nbsp; 
    given grenades and asked to monitor the movements of the Sri Lankan Army as 
    well as of other groups&nbsp; around their camps. When the&nbsp; LTTE attacked 
    and killed several hundred cadres from the TELO in May 1986, several of these&nbsp; 
    children who were on sentry duty were also brutally killed. The&nbsp; enlistment 
    of very young children for military activities began about November 1987, 
    following the establishment of the Indian Army's control over Jaffna. Children 
    as young as ten were used as assassins by the LTTE in a bid to paralyse life 
    in Jaffna. During the middle of 1989, the Indian-backed EPRLF-led coalition 
    press-ganged thousands of youth for its Tamil National Army, hundreds of whom 
    were later massacred by the LTTE. Among the conscripts were many children.</span>

  <p style='margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in'><b><span style='color:maroon'>Institutionalisation 
    of child recruitment</span> <o:p></o:p></b></p>
  <p style='margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in'><span style='color:maroon'>A point 
    had been reached where large numbers of people became disillusioned with the 
    liberation struggle. While mature youths kept away, the use of women and children 
    as combatants became significant from the inception of the war with the IPKF(Indian 
    Army). When the Indian Army withdrew and the LTTE prepared for a fresh round 
    of war with the Sri Lankan forces during the early months of 1990, the use 
    of children had become firmly institutionalised.</span> </p>
  <p style='margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in'><span style='color:maroon'>The 
    LTTE had cornered itself into a situation where its oppressiveness within 
    the community had to be counterbalanced by an appeal deriving from a vision 
    of the grandiose. Sycophancy from all levels of society was used to legitimise 
    its cause and its recruitment drive. We have in our earlier reports described 
    how several members of the elite traded expressions of support for the LTTE 
    in return for special favours in securing their private interests.</span> 
  </p>
  <p style='margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in'><span style='color:maroon'>From 
    1990, the LTTE's methods of enlisting&nbsp; children were initially relatively 
    subtle. The methods employed included displaying cut outs and poster pictures 
    of dead cadre all over, patriotic songs, exhibits of representations of Sri 
    Lankan Army atrocities, meetings in schools, LTTE versions of history in school 
    curricula with compulsory tests and a general exhibition of military glamour. 
    Even children's playgrounds and parks were designed with mock weapons to give 
    children a feeling that they were playing in a battle ground. A common picture 
    seen everywhere in Jaffna in 1990 was of an LTTE soldier holding&nbsp; children 
    on either side and walking towards a hill top where a gun was planted upside 
    down. This symbolically portrayed the vision of the LTTE.</span> </p>
  <p style='margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in'><span style='color:maroon'>An 
    important reason why children were vulnerable to the appeal of the LTTE was 
    the inhuman behaviour of the security forces, particularly in the East, and 
    the constant use of aerial bombing and shelling of civilian areas of the North. 
    It must be remembered that this recruitment was taking place amidst social 
    paralysis, and&nbsp; in a moral vacuum where only one voice could be heard 
    - the voice of the LTTE.</span> </p>
  <p style='margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in'><span style='color:maroon'>Since 
    a momentary perception of glamour, or alienation , rather than political motivation, 
    was what led children to join, this tended to wear off quickly and many children 
    longed to get back to their mothers. Thus, from the beginning, means were 
    contrived by the organisation to trap the children.</span> </p>
  <p style='margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in'><span style='color:maroon'>1. 
    The LTTE's laborious pass system restricts flow of the people from the North. 
    Also, the general travel ban on the age group 10-25 years makes it extremely 
    difficult to take&nbsp; children out of Jaffna.</span> </p>
  <p style='margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in'><span style='color:maroon'>2.As 
    soon as children were taken into the organisation their hair was cropped to 
    make sure that they do not escape. There are several cases of deserters in 
    Jaffna who had to be kept hidden until the hair grew. As the war of June 1990 
    gathered momentum even harsher methods were employed. Children who joined 
    were quickly hidden away and parents were denied contact. The first child 
    to express a wish to go home, was humiliated and given a sound thrashing in 
    front of his mates, which effectively deterred others from expressing any 
    such wish.</span> </p>
  <p style='margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in'><span style='color:maroon'>3.The 
    procedure for leaving the organisation was so punitive that even those who 
    applied to leave after being in the organisation for a number of years often 
    withdrew their application.</span> </p>
  <p style='margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in'><b><span style='color:maroon'>Dehumanisation 
    and traumatisation</span></b> <br>
    <span style='color:maroon'>Many children were used in tasks&nbsp; such as 
    the torture of political prisoners, and in massacres, even of women and children 
    in Muslim and Sinhalese villages. Children were also used in massed frontal 
    attacks such as on Elephant Pass camp in July 1991. There were also very young 
    cadre in other major massed attacks, such as at Pooneryn during November 1993. 
    Each one of these attacks claimed of the order of 500 dead. The trauma of 
    children who suffered permanent&nbsp; loss of limb and saw many of their closest 
    comrades mowed down, made a vivid impression on those who visited Jaffna Hospital. 
    The agony of children who had being used in acts of violence against unarmed 
    civilians, women and children are also on record. Several of them were in 
    the 12-14 age group. Many of them live in a spiritual emptiness where they 
    wish to end their lives, and resign themselves to be used within the organisation 
    itself as suicide operatives. The LTTE also found that&nbsp; children are 
    more useful and efficient as lone assassins. With cyanide in hand, when children 
    lose the fear of being apprehended, they could become very deadly. They have 
    fewer inhibitions and treat the assignments as a game.</span> </p>
  <p style='margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in'><b><span style='color:maroon'>Target 
    groups</span></b> <br>
    <span style='color:maroon'>One gets some idea of which the target groups for 
    recruitment are if one takes into account the fact that in the Jaffna peninsula, 
    the most educationally&nbsp; advanced part of the North-East where many have 
    access to foreign countries, about 20 to 30% of the population has already 
    emigrated to the West. Although the LTTE regards all children as potential 
    recruits and has imposed strict controls on people leaving the North, the 
    elite and their children are accorded favoured treatment in return for their 
    complicity. Displacement of large populations and the high cost of living, 
    partly resulting from the LTTE's means of financing the war, have made the 
    poor extremely desperate. It is such groups that provide most of the child 
    recruits.`Punniapoomi' (Sacred Land) is a school run by the LTTE in Oddusuddan 
    where children are moulded and trained in a militaristic environment. The 
    'Chencholai' group are LTTE sponsored orphanages in Jaffna, where children 
    are taught to sing songs with godly veneration for the Leader and his vision.</span> 
  </p>
  <p style='margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in'><span style='color:maroon'>From 
    early March 1995 even as the recent peace talks were supposed to be going 
    on, LTTE propaganda wing leader Thamil Chelvan addressed school children in 
    the Rural North announcing preparations for the next round of war and calling 
    for volunteers. Recruitment took an aggressive turn, particularly when the 
    war became a physical fact from 19th April. There was a sharp increase in 
    the invasion of schools and tutories in Jaffna by the LTTE to have recruitment 
    sessions. A Student's Revival Week was announced beginning 6th June targeting 
    students in the mid-teens who were to be subjected to intense propaganda and 
    the screening of action videos. Schools are now grinding to a halt as parents 
    and teachers fear for the children. In recent weeks there have been several 
    amazing instances of unorganised and spontaneous resistance by parents and 
    teachers to the LTTE. The latter have used desperate methods to enter schools 
    whose authorities and parents tried to prevent them. Principals have been 
    manhandled and veiled threats issued against individual teachers. Even this 
    resistance may fall apart in the face of the LTTE's resolve to recruit their 
    targetted 10,000 cadre, if the Government continues to bomb and shell civilian 
    areas! Confronted with public demonstrations of disenchantment in earlier 
    times, the LTTE's reflex has been to provoke the opposing state power into 
    a violent response that was as severe as it was blind.</span> </p>
  <p style='margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in'><span style='color:maroon'>In 
    the East the recruitment was concentrated during the ceasefire period of early 
    January to April 19th. One means used to collect children was the screening 
    of video recordings of military operations such as Elephant Pass and Pooneryn. 
    One catergory of youth in the Amparai district among whom the LTTE recruited 
    a significant number are cow hands. These were boys mainly in the age group 
    12 - 16 years who had dropped out of school for reasons of poverty.</span> 
  </p>
  <p style='margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in'><span style='color:maroon'>There 
    were several cases where youngsters were forcibly taken by the LTTE. In one 
    case two boys of ages 15 &amp; 18 respectively from the Ampari District who 
    later walked through the jungles to Urani in the Batticaloa District said 
    that they had been forced by the LTTE which otherwise threatened to set fire 
    to their houses. In Kallar people complained to the STF that LTTE recruiters 
    were forcibly taking four boys in a north-bound public&nbsp; bus towards Batticaloa. 
    They were rescued by the STF at the Cheddipalyam check-point. The incident 
    was reported in the press and was independently confirmed by us. A technique 
    commonly employed was for an LTTE cadre to lure a school boy away to a lonely 
    place by asking him for a lift on his bicycle.</span> </p>
  <p style='margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in'><span style='color:maroon'>Even 
    for children who went on their own, the transience of the attraction clearly 
    revealed itself. In the Batticaloa District , unlike in LTTE controlled Jaffna, 
    many of the boys were able to escape and go into hiding or surrender to the 
    Army, provided they had not been sent to Jaffna immediately. There was also 
    the&nbsp;&nbsp; operation of a herd instinct. Often boys joined as a group 
    and deserted as a group. In Veechukalmunai, four joined after a video session, 
    and all four later returned home. There are several cases of this kind. One 
    of the LTTE's operations during the ceasefire was to launch boy-hunts for 
    youngsters with cropped hair (the first thing done upon recruitment) who were 
    in hiding.</span> <br>
    <span style='color:maroon'>&nbsp;</span> <br>
    <span style='color:maroon'>Around Batticaloa town itself more than 40 youths, 
    both escaped and deserted from the LTTE recently, were handed over to their 
    parents by the Army through various channels. Other sources in the North said 
    that during the ceasefire, about seven&nbsp; MRS buses brought Eastern youth 
    for training in Mullaitivu- a total of more than 500. The age group they said 
    was below 15 and sometimes less than ten. The total number recruited or conscripted 
    from the East during&nbsp; this period is placed at about 1500 - some put 
    it below this figure and others estimate figures as high as 3000. The majority 
    of the recruits were from certain parts of Batticaloa District including Kiran 
    and Sittandy areas. Knowledgeable sources place the total number recruited 
    in Trincomalee District at much below 200.</span> </p>
  <p style='margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in'><b><span style='color:maroon'>Addressing 
    the issues: Some first steps</span></b> </p>
  <p style='margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in'><span style='color:maroon'>The 
    use of children as combatants in the manner it is done brings out certain 
    features of the Tamil struggle in its present debased form. Apart from condemning 
    the LTTE for methods of this kind, we need to understand&nbsp; other important 
    factors which&nbsp; contribute to this tragedy.</span> </p>
  <p style='margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in'><span style='color:maroon'>From&nbsp; 
    past experiences with the Security Forces, most Tamils do feel insecure. Even 
    people who stayed in refugee camps during 1990 were taken away by the Security 
    Forces and hundreds of them disappeared (eg. Eastern University). Most of 
    the poor who live in interior villages in the Eastern Province have undergone 
    tremendous hardships resulting from the total disregard with which they have 
    been&nbsp; treated by the State. Invariably every family has been affected 
    by Security Forces activity. Their constant disabilities&nbsp; range from 
    threat to their life, to a breakdown of economic activity. Young children 
    continue to live with bitter memories amidst fear. Their internalised anger 
    is being effectively harnessed by the LTTE in various ways.</span> </p>
  <p style='margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in'><span style='color:maroon'>Unless 
    the voices of people who are marginalised are heard and responded to, the 
    present trend will continue. Owing to the chauvinist ideology in which most 
    members of the Security Forces have been moulded, they are unable to respond 
    creatively to the dilemma of ordinary Tamils, and find it more congenial to 
    rely on the use of terror.</span> </p>
  <p style='margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in'><span style='color:maroon'>The 
    grim fate staring at these children scarred by the war poses a major challenge 
    for democratic forces in the South that are working for peace. They need to 
    understand the predicament of the ordinary Tamil&nbsp; people and consistently 
    uphold their interests by making the Security Forces accountable.</span> </p>
  <p style='margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in'><span style='color:maroon'>Moreover, 
    the Government needs to take the initiative to monitor the activities of the 
    Security Forces especially in the interior villages. The reality in Jaffna 
    too needs clear understanding. The children are growing up in a militarised 
    environment, having constantly faced bombing and shelling. They have been 
    in every sense trapped by a force which sees children chiefly as cannon fodder.</span> 
  </p>
  <p style='margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in'><span style='color:maroon'>Suicidal 
    attacks and cyanide carrying cadre symbolise the overall nature of the political 
    trend. If it cannot attain its goal of achieving&nbsp; uncontested power (ie. 
    Eelam) , it will commit both itself and the section of Tamil society within 
    its ambit to collective suicide. This is the inescapable direction of its 
    logic.</span> <br>
    <span style='color:maroon'>How do we break this vicious circle? If the&nbsp; 
    Government is prepared to accept that the politics of the past, with its narrow 
    sectarian ends, had created the present crisis, it is necessary to look into 
    every aspect of life which has been affected by it.</span> </p>
  <p style='margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in'><span style='color:maroon'>Has 
    the Government any message for the children, the marginalised, and the youths 
    in&nbsp; Tamil society ? If so, are there any concrete programmes to educate 
    and guide the Armed Forces who are the only representatives of the Government 
    in the war zones? Are there any structures which have been vested with adequate 
    powers to give effect to such programmes? Is there any qualitative change 
    in the outlook of the military to encompass the complex reality of the present 
    and the ethnic nature of the conflict?</span> </p>
  <p style='margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in'><span style='color:maroon'>Then, 
    how do Tamils themselves deal with this phenomenon of child warriors? We can 
    no doubt academically explain the present reality. But can we justify it and 
    allow this trend to continue when we can clearly see that its outcome is necessarily 
    the total destruction of our community? In the present reality where ordinary 
    Tamil people are powerless,&nbsp; some&nbsp; perceive it as a neccessity to 
    preserve the LTTE with its child battalions comprising other people's children, 
    as a means to extract a political solution from the Government. Hence all 
    criticism is muted. But the hypocrisy of this position becomes evident from 
    the fact that it is nearly always voiced by elites from outside the North 
    East and by a few in Jaffna whose children have been secured means of escape. 
    On the other hand the victims and prospective victims in the North-East are 
    daily voicing their doubts in several ways about the politics which is neither 
    defensive nor liberating. Tamil opinion makers, politicians and expatriates 
    must look at the fate that awaits these children and the community, and rethink 
    the roles they are playing now.</span> </p>
  <p style='margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in'><span style='color:maroon'>At 
    a broader level, can we allow such collective brutalisation to continue in 
    the name of patriotism, national integrity and sovereignty; or&nbsp; of the 
    right to self determination and liberation? We do know from experience that 
    these notions are only rhetorical in the absence of any corresponding substance 
    in the politics of either side that could give them realisation.</span> <br>
