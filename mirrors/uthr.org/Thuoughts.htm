<h2><a name="a"></a>Some thoughts on Human rights and non state forces</h2>
<p><font size="+4">U</font>pholding human rights in a situation of armed conflict 
  raises many issues. International humanitarian laws have provided some guidelines 
  to 'humanize' the conflict by laying down basic norms for the warring parties. 
  Although these guidelines are often applicable to internal conflicts, the implementation 
  of these principles to the state which is involved in internal conflict is itself 
  problematic, leave alone the non state forces. It poses many unanswered questions 
  and dilemmas to the human rights community. Further, internal armed conflicts 
  are invariably having a massive impact on civilians that includes death, destruction 
  of properties and massive internal displacements. <br>
  <br>
  In intra-national conflicts, which are becoming widespread, the civilians tend 
  to become the targets more than the combatants themselves. Further, such conflicts 
  attract the attention of the international community only when there is a major 
  tragedy, owing to the present dynamics of the media which is dominanted by market 
  competitiveness rather than ethics. This has in turn led to an intrinsic dynamism 
  which pushes the non-state actors to manipulate situations to ensure that more 
  people are massacred by the adversary. They thus engage in &quot;spectacular 
  &quot; attacks without any concern for civilian life. <br>
  <br>
  Further, the spread of small arms, child soldiers, and the use of land mines, 
  are all increasingly widespread. Although the human rights discourse is becoming 
  important in the international arena, on the ground itself, growing alienation 
  and marginalization of communities is leading to further uses of ethnic and 
  religious ideologies as a tool to galvanize populations by the ruling elites 
  of all sides. The resulting upsurge of ethnic and religious nationalism is in 
  turn leading to demands for redefining the boundaries of states or even transformation 
  towards theocratic states.<br>
  <br>
  Most intra-national conflicts challenge the legitimacy of the so called &quot;national 
  states&quot; which grew out of a colonial past and &quot; right of self determination 
  &quot; is being deployed to challenge the status quo. On the other hand the 
  states fall back on the concept of &quot;sovereignty' to ward off any criticism 
  of their treatment of minorities.</p>
<p>These vulnerable states also highlight the hypocrisy and double standards of 
  others who criticize them so as to avoid being accountable for their behavior. 
  But all these do not happen in an abstract 'state' vs 'minority' context alone. 
  The state's actions against an ethnic or religious segment of its population 
  is governed by an ideological milieu, in which the state is determined by the 
  dominant ideology - that of the majority community. Hence there are more and 
  more ethnic or religious currents dominating the political discourse and social 
  life in electoral democracies. The state may consciously or by its acts of omission 
  and commission influence this political evolution.<br>
</p>
<p>The rise in political demands, based on the right of self determination has 
  its inherent political imperative as well as ideological connotation. The question 
  is whether the ideological content will potentially lead to the negation of 
  the same right to the other segments (religious and ethnic minorities) in the 
  same community as well impair other democratic norms. We could argue at the 
  outset that the political imperative is to deal with the political aspect of 
  the problem and find ways and means to restructure the state in a more meaningful 
  way to accommodate the aspirations of the 'others'. But the aspirations also 
  could be very much determined by the content of the ideology and the nature 
  of the movements who are spearheading the struggle for the 'right to self determination', 
  and the extent of their hold on the society. <br>
</p>
<p>In many instances, armed opposition groups were aiming either at capturing 
  power or forming a new secessionist state. Whether they succeed in their objectives 
  or not, they are in essence, states in making. Their, achieving their objective 
  may depend on various factors that are internal as well as external. States 
  which are facing an internal threat to their authority, tend to counter the 
  opposition by authoritarian means, which leads to further alienation of a section 
  of the population. Further brutalisation of the state and hence of society leads 
  to a vicious circle, which traps the people in an unresolvable conundrum. </p>
<p>With our historical experience of the last 100 years, it is time to re-evaluate 
  and develop criteria and means to constrain resorts to arbitrary violence and 
  to minimise human rights violations, so as to preserve human dignity. This would 
  ensure that degeneration and dehumanisation are minimised. All the political 
  formations, which are involved in struggles claim to articulate the interest 
  of the people whom they supposedly represent. It is in the name of people alone, 
  that these organisations justify their actions and their aims. The ideals and 
  aims which they profess, may in general, have legitimacy but the strategies 
  and tactics, which largely determine that process, will be the deciding factor 
  influencing future of the community. </p>
<p>The following are key questions which arise in any given conflict situation: 
  Are the people, whom the protagonists claim to represent, free to determine 
  the course of events? How much are these groups accountable to the people? What 
  type of role do the people have in the process of struggle? Is there any way 
  we can make sure, that there are concrete forces which guarantee a corrective 
  influence on the movement's value judgements and constrain them? Are the people 
  themselves becoming trapped in a vicious and destructive political game while 
  their ability to escape is physically or otherwise impeded? These are serious 
  questions which need urgent answers in order to evaluate the character of a 
  given struggle and its probable outcome. </p>
<p>The experience of the Nazi Germany and &quot;post-totalitarian systems&quot; 
  of the East European states as Vaclav Havel called them, brings out the possibility 
  of social manipulation some could exercise at a crude level. </p>
<p>We are thus led to ask, what are the minimal conditions a society must maintain 
  in order to provide space for people to make evaluations and express their opinions 
  in an environment of armed conflict? How do we evaluate tendencies which would 
  in all likelihood lead to a more authoritarian regime or impose more oppressive 
  structures? Can international organisations develop general criteria to make 
  these groups accountable?</p>
<p>Hence the challenge for the human rights community is two-fold. One is to examine 
  from the normative level, the question of right of self-determination and to 
  see what will be the outcome of its logic in the present nation-state paradigm. 
  We must moreover identify clearly and define various stages of achieving that 
  right which would in essence guarantees security and create space for full political 
  participation to defend a community's identity in its fuller sense. The second 
  task is to identify the criteria and strategies we could use to ensure that 
  the rhetorical articulation of the right to self-determination does not undermine 
  all other basic human and democratic rights that the community has already gained 
  in significant measure. That must necessarily lead to monitoring not only the 
  state but also non-state actors and the dispositions of the society. When the 
  society has already entered the phase of armed conflict the monitoring of the 
  armed groups and the residual civil society becomes paramount.</p>
<p> This also leads to the question how the tenets of UDHR, which claimed to be 
  universal, could become meaningful to different societies with different cultural, 
  socio economic and historical backgrounds. Combining the UDHR with concepts 
  of liberal democracy and free market economics and other cultural norms from 
  western experience has led to the allegation that the imposition of human rights 
  is an extension of the (neo) colonial project. Trying to extract the basic tenets 
  of human rights to understand what kind of political structure will enhance 
  and defend it for the populace at large in a specific context is itself a task 
  that needs to be pursued vigorously. We further need to examine the possible 
  alternative political formations, which will not negate the tenets of UDHR and 
  at the same time preserve the cohesiveness of the society so as to enhance positively 
  its economic and social development. </p>
