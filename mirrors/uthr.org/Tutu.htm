<h1>Stop Killing the Children</h1>
<h2>By Desmond Tutu, in the <em>Washington Post,</em> 24 November, 1996, p. C07</h2>
<p>It is the mission of priests of all religions, everywhere, to help their followers 
  seek good and shun evil. Ever since I was a parish priest, I have tried to do 
  this and in the process have learned quite a lot about both good and evil. But 
  never as a young man could I have imagined that one day I would find myself 
  pleading with world leaders to stop the killing of children. Killing children? 
  Why would any sane person kill children? And yet it is happening as never before. 
</p>
<p>Some 2 million children have died in dozens of wars during the past decade 
  according to a new study that has just been presented to the United Nations. 
  By comparison, American friends tell me, this is more than three times the number 
  of battlefield deaths of American soldiers in all their wars since 1776. Few 
  civilians, let alone children, died in those wars. Today, civilians account 
  for more than 90 percent of war casualties. The reasons for this terrible toll 
  are, first, a fundamental change in the kind of wars being fought and, second, 
  a chilling international indifference to the obscenity of killing innocent non-combatants, 
  mostly the powerless who have no champions in the centers of world power. </p>
<p>For most of modern history, armies fought armies along battle lines that divided 
  nations. Today, wars are fought for territory and dominance within countries, 
  neighbor against neighbor, the bitterest kind of aggression. Outsiders find 
  these complex conflicts unfathomable. It is easy for many, far from Zaire or 
  Cambodia or Bosnia, to dismiss the deaths and trauma of civilians and children 
  as an inevitable side effect of war. </p>
<p>That argument is not only false, it is profoundly immoral. The U.N. &quot;Report 
  on the Impact of Armed Conflict on Children&quot; is the result of a two-year 
  investigation carried out by the former Mozambican minister for education, Ms. 
  Graca Machel. It not only details the devastating effects of war on children, 
  it also recommends practical steps for us to face our moral responsibility and 
  end these far from inevitable atrocities. </p>
<p>The report's proposals will be considered by the General Assembly in December. 
  They are simple and direct, such as banning military recruitment of anyone under 
  18 and the immediate demobilization of child soldiers, prohibiting shipment 
  of weapons to conflict zones and prosecuting rape and sexual torture as war 
  crimes. If implemented, they would go a long way toward strengthening the force 
  of existing treaties, the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Geneva 
  Conventions and the Convention to End Discrimination Against Women -- all of 
  them inadequately enforced. I particularly like the recommendation to require 
  companies and countries that profit from the manufacture and export of land 
  mines to contribute to mine awareness programs for children and efforts to clear 
  the world's 110 million mines. </p>
<p>I am incensed when I hear these common-sense proposals called &quot;hopelessly 
  idealistic&quot; or &quot;impractical.&quot; That is defeatist nonsense. What 
  we need today is an upsurge of international courage, moral indignation and 
  human solidarity to demand action to end the crimes being committed against 
  the innocent in war. Just such public pressure succeeded in banning the use 
  of poison gas and is behind the progress toward nuclear disarmament. The proposals 
  in the Machel report are just as achievable. </p>
<p>In democracies, we, the people, have the power to shape national and international 
  policy -- to seek the good and shun evil, if you will. I would like to call 
  on my fellow priests in all religions to take this clear-cut issue of right 
  and wrong to their hearts and to galvanize their followers. If an aroused public 
  insists, governments will respond. The job now is to spread the word and inspire 
  public confidence that the good we want can prevail. If we will it, we can end 
  the crimes of targeting children for death and involving them in war's bloodshed. 
  To have this power and fail to use it makes us accomplices of the killers. </p>
