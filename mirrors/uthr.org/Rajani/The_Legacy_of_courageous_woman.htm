color:black'>That was how <span class=SpellE>Rajani</span> <span class=SpellE>Thiranagama</span> 
  began a letter she wrote to some friends some months before her death in September 
  1989. A packed house gathered in the Committee Room A of the BMICH to remember 
  and celebrate this courageous woman&#146;s life which had been ended at the 
  young age of 35 by an assassin&#146;s bullet. It was not a gathering of the 
  intellectuals and the elite who usually make up the audience at a Memorial Lecture. 
  Here were people from all walks of life, listening through simultaneous interpreters, 
  to enchanting lyrics in Tamil sung, among others, by <span class=SpellE>Rajani&#146;s</span> 
  own sisters, to a meaningful poem in Sinhala read by its author <span class=SpellE>Liyanage</span> 
  <span class=SpellE>Amarakeerthi</span>, to the full text of the emotional letter 
  to friends written by <span
class=SpellE>Rajani</span> ten months before her death, and to the powerful Memorial 
  Lecture by another courageous political activist from neighbouring India, <span class=SpellE>Nandita</span> 
  <span class=SpellE>Haksar</span>.</span></p>
<p style='line-height:13.5pt'><span class=SpellE><span style='font-size:9.5pt;
font-family:&quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:black'>Rajani</span></span><span
style='font-size:9.5pt;font-family:"Verdana","sans-serif";color:black'> <span
class=SpellE>Thiranagama</span> was, by any yardstick, a remarkably courageous 
  woman. As a young medical student, she had persuaded the Medical Students Union 
  for the first time to join a student strike in the mid-seventies to protest 
  the Police killing of student <span class=SpellE>Weerasuriya</span> at the <span
class=SpellE>Peradeniya</span> campus. Not long after, she broke free from her 
  middle class Tamil Christian upbringing to marry a Sinhala Buddhist with a peasant 
  background. While serving as a junior medical officer, there were scores of 
  instances when she went out of her way to tend the marginalized. Even after 
  she took up an academic career at the University of Jaffna, she courageously 
  treated the injured, civilians as well as militant cadres, not just because 
  it was her duty under the Hippocratic Oath to which all medical practitioners 
  subscribe but because it was just the right thing to do as a fellow human being. 
  It was also about this time that <span class=SpellE>Rajani&#146;s</span> sister 
  <span class=SpellE>Nirmala</span> was detained under the <span
class=GramE>dreaded,</span> and still dreaded, Prevention of Terrorism Act. <span
class=SpellE>Rajani</span> struggled for her sister&#146;s release, a struggle 
  she continued in London where she had gone for her post-graduate studies.</span></p>
<p style='line-height:13.5pt'><span style='font-size:9.5pt;font-family:&quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;
color:black'>Her experience of state terror in Jaffna and her continuing agony 
  at her sister&#146;s detention under the PTA probably led to her joining the 
  LTTE. But LTTE&#146;s own terror apparatus, its lack of any adherence to democratic 
  norms, the killing of dissidents and opponents and its general fascist nature, 
  soon led to her disassociating herself from the LTTE. When she returned from 
  London to the Jaffna University, she was conscious of the risks she faced. She 
  helped found the University Teachers for Human Rights with two equally courageous 
  fellow academics and also spearheaded the formation of a Co-ordinating Committee 
  of staff, students and trade unionists at the Jaffna University, headed by the 
  Vice-Chancellor himself, to tackle the various crises that arise in a politically 
  charged academic environment. She also co-authored with her UTHR colleagues 
  The Broken Palmyra, still a classic in dissident journalism. The book chronicled 
  and commented on the acts of terror and violence unleashed on the civilian population 
  of Jaffna by the various actors, the militant groups particularly the LTTE, 
  the Indian Peace Keeping Forces and the state security forces. It is the credit 
  of <span class=SpellE>Rajani&#146;s</span> colleagues and co-authors, <span class=SpellE>Rajan</span> 
  <span class=SpellE>Hoole</span> and Sritharan, that they have, despite being 
  forced to working underground, continued the good work they began with <span class=SpellE>Rajani</span>.</span></p>
<p style='line-height:13.5pt'><span class=SpellE><b><span style='font-size:

<p style='line-height:13.5pt'><span style='font-size:9.5pt;font-family:&quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;
color:black'>When <span class=SpellE>Rajani</span> returned from to the Jaffna 
  University and co-authored The Broken Palmyra, she knew she was walking into 
  a powder keg. In the words of the recent statement by the UTHR, &quot;<span
class=SpellE>Rajani</span> had no illusions about the LTTE and was in greater 
  danger as an ex-<span class=SpellE>LTTEer</span> challenging the outfit. One 
  cannot fully explain the rationality or otherwise of decisions taken long ago. 
  It was as an act of meaningful defiance that we decided that the book should 
  be published with the names of all the authors. The preprint edition was well 
  received by our Sinhalese colleagues in the South and was widely photocopied. 
  </span></p>
<p style='line-height:13.5pt'><span style='font-size:9.5pt;font-family:&quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;
color:black'>If <span class=SpellE>Rajani</span> had been alive today she would 
  have done the same for the victims of the war now ended and challenged the ideologues 
  on both sides who boast of their military genius at the expense of the people. 
  She would not have stopped there. She believed that the people should be mobilised 
  and structures built to consolidate their gains. In 1987, the first act in which 
  she played a leading role was to talk to the Indian Army and reopen the University 
  of Jaffna, as an available structure that could become a base for others. She 
  was sometimes almost alone in the Medical Faculty with a few loyal labourers 
  getting the Anatomy Department back into shape.</span></p>
<p style='line-height:13.5pt'><span style='font-size:9.5pt;font-family:&quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;
color:black'>We may record here that when the Indian Army found out about the 
  pre-print edition of the Broken Palmyra they quickly acquired copies and we 
  were told that three different intelligence teams were assessing them. They 
  were annoyed, harassed us a little, sometimes on spurious intelligence, but 
  generally took it up as well as one might expect. While fighting the LTTE and 
  setting up the conscript Tamil National Army was dirty business, there was also 
  at some level in the Indian Army sensitivity to democratic freedoms.&quot;</span></p>
<p style='line-height:13.5pt'><span style='font-size:9.5pt;font-family:&quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;
color:black'>In June 1989, the <span class=SpellE>Premadasa</span> Government, 
  with the knowledge and without opposition from the defence establishment, got 
  the Sri Lankan army to deliver a consignment of fighting equipment to the LTTE 
  and simultaneously ordered the IPKF to withdraw from Sri Lanka. <span
class=SpellE>Rajini</span> was then in Britain on a three-month stint to complete 
  her research thesis. She returned to Jaffna in early September and in the same 
  month, the LTTE gunman pumped several bullets into this unarmed woman riding 
  a bicycle to make sure that she was dead.</span></p>

  making but a passionate charismatic fighter for justice who, unbeknown to either 
  one <span
class=GramE>us</span>, was writing her own epitaph. There are two images of <span
class=SpellE>Rajani</span> preserved in my memory. The first is the one I just 
  described &#150; the feisty advocate of justice addressing the crowd with a 
  wagging finger of her right hand while with her left hand holding on to her 
  sari. The other image is <span class=SpellE>Rajini</span> by the side of my 
  grandmother&#146;s deathbed at <span class=SpellE>Kalubowila</span> Hospital 
  trying to explain to me, with patience and caring, that my grandmother was unlikely 
  to wake from her coma. Sadly the qualities she possessed in such are in very 
  short supply today.&quot;</span></p>

style='font-size:9.5pt;font-family:"Verdana","sans-serif";color:black'> <span
class=SpellE>Thiranagama</span>, <span class=SpellE>Rajani&#146;s</span> husband, 
  spoke at the BMICH event and had this to say: &quot;(The work of the UTHR and 
  their) political ideas sent shockwaves through the professed monolithic structure 
  of the Tamil Tigers. (They) understood the possible political danger from <span class=SpellE>Rajani</span>. 
  The Tigers would not hesitate to stop a livewire of the organisation, <span class=SpellE>Rajani&#146;s</span> 
  life and death shows how long, arduous and painful is the road to victory is 
  when human dignity and the right to dissent are violated by those who choose 
  to use violence to resolve political issues. It is also necessary to reflect 
  on the validity of <span class=SpellE>Rajani&#146;s</span> ideas in relation 
  to the current political situation. To use <span class=SpellE>Rajani&#146;s</span> 
  phrase still, we are walking through a dark valley, and inhumanity is everywhere. 
  One of the fundamental issues today is the fear to speak out or the right to 
  dissent.&quot;</span></p>
<p style='line-height:13.5pt'><span style='font-size:9.5pt;font-family:&quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;
color:black'>All these truths about the life and death of <span class=SpellE>Rajani</span> 
  and of her commitment to human dignity and justice came out very clearly at 
  the BMICH event. It was therefore surprising to find a critic rushing to print 
  complaining that the event was marked by &#145;an absence of actuality&#146;. 
  Perhaps this critic wanted the event to focus only on flogging a dead horse, 
  the killers of <span class=SpellE>Rajani</span>. That may have suited someone&#146;s 
  political agenda but the event was meant as a celebration of <span
class=SpellE>Rajani&#146;s</span> life. Hers was a courageous woman&#146;s unwavering 
  commitment to justice, for human dignity and to the empowerment of the marginalised, 
  particularly women. She was an outspoken critic of injustice and violence against 
  the unarmed, where most others chose to remain selectively silent when civilians 
  were massacred by the militants as well as by the state security forces. Most 
  chose to remain silent when the <span class=SpellE>Premadasa</span> Government 
  armed the LTTE shortly before <span class=SpellE>Rajani&#146;s</span> assassination. 
  Most continue to remain silent in the face of the unlawful detention of civilians 
  in IDP camps. As <span class=SpellE>Dayapala</span> <span
class=SpellE>Thiranagama</span> has stated, &quot;Those who follow <span
class=SpellE>Rajani&#146;s</span> path will make our world a better place.&quot;</span></p>
<p style='line-height:13.5pt'><b><span style='font-size:9.5pt;font-family:&quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;
color:black'>A Collective Conscience Needed</span></b></p>
<p style='line-height:13.5pt'><span style='font-size:9.5pt;font-family:&quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;
color:black'>We end with two quotes from the UTHR&#146;s tribute to their former 
  colleague which captures the vision of <span class=SpellE>Rajani</span>: &quot;A 
  nervous government, unable to acknowledge the war has ended, keeping up synthetically 
  a mood of grave military threat from the decimated LTTE, wants the Sinhalese 
  to view the problem (that way). The oldest dissidents on record, the Prophets 
  of Israel, made it uncompromisingly clear that warring against truth and denying 
  justice makes a people small, and the state brittle. That is today the main 
  challenge facing the Sinhalese, against a government that wants to make them 
  a small people. </span></p>
<p style='line-height:13.5pt'><span style='font-size:9.5pt;font-family:&quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;
color:black'>Patriotism has been narrowed to represent the interest of a section 
  of a ruling clique. All criticism of how the war was waged is equated with treachery. 
  Arrogance of Power is so open and naked, that the state is losing all inhibitions 
  against undermining the rule of law.&quot;</span></p>
<p style='line-height:13.5pt'><span style='font-size:9.5pt;font-family:&quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;
color:black'>The other quote is a statement signed by 50 academics of the Jaffna 
  University and released by the UTHR in 1988. The draft statement was reportedly 
  prepared by <span class=SpellE>Rajani</span>. Written over 20 years ago, it 
  is more than valid even today: &quot;Our obeisance to terror within the community, 
  and our opportunism and lack of principles in the face of many internal killings, 
  have made it easy for external forces to use the same weapons to control us&#133;Thus 
  if the people are to regain their lost self-will and dignity, they will have 
  to move towards a principled collective response. We have to assert universal 
  values to which we are both emotionally and intellectually committed. It is 
  the lack of such commitment that enabled us to come to terms with murder, when 
  it concerned others&#146; sons, and then, watch helplessly in panic when the 
  cancer, allowed to grow, threatened our own sons. We are now paying the price 
  for our past indifference&#133;</span></p>
<p style='line-height:13.5pt'><span style='font-size:9.5pt;font-family:&quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;
color:black'>&quot;As individuals or small groups in our neighbourhoods, places 
  of work, unions or associations, we must question our past, understand where 
  we went wrong, and rediscover our principles. We must be conscious of the message 
  of past experience, that in standing up for others we also stand up for ourselves. 
  This course requires courage; and, no other is open to us. We have tried to 
  play safe in the past. The result was mass murder from several sources. Non-combatant 
  civilians too became unarmed front-line troops facing the wrath of advancing 
  armies. The future looks even <span class=GramE>more bleak</span>, with the 
  rapid growth and consolidation in southern Sri Lanka of forces of narrow political 
  vision. This opens the door for further involvement by external forces. Let 
  us not remain forever unprepared and continue trapped in the logic of passivity 
  - hoping against hope that someone else will bring us deliverance.&quot;</span></p>
