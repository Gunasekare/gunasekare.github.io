<h3><a name=personal></a><a name="_Toc240702629"><span lang=EN-US>1. Her personal 
  journey and legacy</span></a></h3>
<p><span lang=EN-US>The very fact that <span class=GramE>Rajani</span> who died 
  young at 35, twenty years ago, is remembered today with enthusiasm both near 
  and far signifies an immense void she left behind, one that remains unfilled 
  to this day. She held no high office. What she leaves behind is an undying model 
  of womanhood characterised by youthful energy and selfless idealism for an equitable 
  social order that transcended social and ethnic barriers. Nurtured in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Jaffna</st1:place></st1:City> 
  of the 1960s and 1970s where narrow Tamil nationalism had taken root as the 
  only conceivable defence against the workings of Sinhalese state ideology, her 
  marriage to Dayapala Thiranagama, an academic and active Sinhalese leftist, 
  opened up new vistas. </span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>She came to see the grinding poverty faced by masses in the 
  <st1:place w:st="on">Deep South</st1:place>, the disfranchisement of Tamil plantation 
  labour and the chauvinist ideology of the Sinhalese ruling class, which in turn 
  pushed the minorities into extremist positions, as one single continuum of evil. 
  One cannot describe an order that has long wallowed in an excess of violence 
  as other than evil. The politics of ethnic patronage centred on the Sinhalese 
  leadership was founded on wheeler-dealing among ethnic representatives who might 
  become friends, but it worked by keeping the people from different ethnic groups 
  divided and suspicious of one another. It gave no community the intrinsic dignity 
  that comes to a people from reaching out.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>Its working was evident in the first parliament where in the 
  game of farming out patronage the Sinhalese elite leadership secured the cooperation 
  of its Tamil and Muslim counterparts to support the disfranchisement of the 
  Plantation Labour. Violence along ethnic and class lines became endemic. Yet 
  the minorities never got together in any meaningful manner. Tamil nationalism 
  inherited the same intolerance Sinhalese nationalism showed towards the minorities, 
  in its dealings with other subdivisions of the minorities. Its intolerance towards 
  the Muslims ultimately reached notorious proportions. </span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>In the following two passages from Vol.II, Chapter 6 of the 
  Broken Palmyra, which was largely authored by Rajani, the first shows the inherent 
  nature of Tamil nationalism that developed as a reactive phenomenon to the violence 
  of the Sinhalese polity. Its fatal weakness lay in its dependence on rhetoric 
  with no viable programme:</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>&#147;<i>The failure of the Tamil national leadership to get 
  anything from the Sinhalese ruling class through parliament was in contradiction 
  with the rhetoric of anger and the slogans of valour they were feeding the electorate. 
  As a consequence of this a sense of frustration and bitterness was created among 
  the people. And as brutal mob violence was the reply to non-violence, Tamil 
  nationalism no longer confined itself to a class but reached out to all sectors 
  of the people across class, caste, and regional barriers</i>.&#148;</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>The second shows its debilitating weakness and cause of ultimate 
  failure, through its failure to reach out and accommodate:</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;text-autospace:none'><span lang=EN-US>&#147;<i>The 
  development of the northern front occurred at the expense of many fundamental 
  tasks of nation building. The blind spot in the concept of the Tamil nation 
  was the question of two large sections of the Tamil speaking people - the Muslims 
  or the Islamic Tamils and the hill country (plantation) Tamils. Tamil nationalism 
  was the ideology of the Tamils of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Sri 
  Lanka</st1:place></st1:country-region>. Historically, it had very tenuous links 
  with the ideology of the Islamic or hill country Tamils of Sri Lanka</i>.&#148; 
  </span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>What made Rajani an attractive personality who would not be 
  extinguished by death was her idealism and urge to fight for justice, taking 
  many risks in her life. She struggled within herself and tried to find meaning 
  for her actions and had the courage to change the direction when she felt her 
  participation was contributing to the subjugation of her own people. It was 
  her belief that theories were not for conference readings and discussion papers, 
  but to be used as guides to search the world we live in and discover paths to 
  change the world and society for the better. Her avid interest in political 
  theories and Marxist literature continuously energised her work, driving her 
  towards identifying with the suffering of the people. It was this spontaneous 
  sympathy with the vulnerable and downtrodden that led her into the LTTE. This 
  brings us to the present. </span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>The recently concluded war is being hailed as an astounding 
  success by the ruling class, and sundry experts from countries that seem too 
  ready to come to terms with impunity as a privilege of the State. The success 
  of the war is being measured by the same yardstick with which Sinhalese youth 
  rebellions were crushed in 1971 and 1990. The same ruling class had ironically 
  been more than ready to appease the LTTE in 1989-90 and again in 2002-2005. 
  They were both founded on cynical calculations that cauterizing the North-East 
  and giving its people over to the whims of the LTTE, would buy the South an 
  economic reprieve. </span></p>
<p>Today up to 300 000 IDPs are interned behind barbed wire without any sensitivity 
  to their real needs, but rather exacerbating the terrible trauma they suffered 
  for several months running from place to place under government bombardment, 
  suffering injury and bereavement. Adding to this was the LTTE&#146;s conscription 
  of their children, many of them now dead or maimed. Yesterday it was the LTTE 
  removing their children, and now in IDP camps it is the fear of the Army abducting 
  them, leaving behind no record. The Government promised the IDPs who came out 
  a new spring, and that is the point where reconciliation should have begun. 
  That opportunity was lost. </p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>The recent story of peace and war reveals the sense of responsibility 
  the ruling class shows towards the most helpless sections of the people who 
  become victims of their fickle calculations, each in turn hailed as a brilliant 
  stroke by the peace community worldwide. The LTTE was given the freedom to conscript 
  children; and to forcibly transport young men and women from among the fisher 
  folk and peasantry across the Muhamalai army checkpoint, make them to undergo 
  military training in the Vanni and bring them back to their homes. When the 
  war began in 2006, the State&#146;s killer squads operating in and out of uniform 
  ruthlessly targeted and killed these unarmed persons on the streets and in their 
  homes before their families. And so the war was won by massacring thousands 
  of innocents. That too is being hailed as a brilliant stroke by defence analysts 
  while the peace community is silent.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>The victory against the LTTE, as against the JVP earlier, 
  would soon become hollow without political transformation that would end the 
  legacy of conflict. Is it not a tragic irony that in 61 years of independence 
  the State won several bloody victories against its own people, Tamils and Sinhalese, 
  without doing any political work necessary for healing? Every time the fault 
  lines of class and ethnicity crack, the ruling class has not sought any medicine 
  other than the same brutal bloodletting and then with their media and experts 
  to pat themselves on the back. In turn this class has sought relentless centralisation, 
  indeed personalisation, of power, corrupting law enforcement and rendering the 
  masses even more helpless against a heartless State. After decades of independence, 
  we have a mere shadow of the working administrative and law enforcement systems 
  left behind by the British after thoroughly subverting democracy and the accountability 
  mechanisms that were in place at Independence. </span></p>
<p>With the LTTE decimated, in place of undertaking the task of nation building 
  and a political settlement, the rulers are once more arming themselves to the 
  teeth. It was as though the State is destined continually to war against some 
  segment of its own people. Against this background we have another remarkable 
  phenomenon. In 1983 Human Rights became a bad word, when the victims were Tamils, 
  and Amnesty International hailed a terrorist outfit. Then came 1987 when the 
  South saw bloodletting. Human rights became so popular that it enabled the current 
  President to make his political fortune. What is it that is so terribly wrong 
  with this country, is it that the people are cursed with an unstoppable potency 
  for unruliness and rebellion? Or, is it the rulers who took increasingly to 
  disporting like emperors in their proverbial new clothes, as the State takes 
  on the appearance of the LTTE&#146;s twin? </p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>Rajani, with her broader humanity that reached out across 
  barriers of birth, would have found the recent war completely abhorrent. She 
  understood the nature of the State and the causes of alienation in both the 
  South and the North-East. She understood the provocations and emotional responses 
  that drove the young into violence and how the politics of violence itself deeply 
  divided societies. As much as a section of Tamils saw the LTTE as the only hope 
  against a Sinhalese state that would yield nothing; there were many others who 
  saw mainly its violence against its own people and nothing in its leaders except 
  crass brutality and sadism, and yearned for its demise.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>A state that long neglects its obligation to deal with the 
  people politically and resorts to mindless violence and mass killing of the 
  young and family men in suspect groups, marks a symptom of one unable to seek 
  democratic solutions and so nervous and fearful as could base its authority, 
  not on the people but principally on its killer machinery. Understanding the 
  dilemma of the young, Rajani opposed killing in the name of national security 
  or as the prerogative of sole representatives. To her the young under these 
  adverse conditions are bound to make mistakes and they should be given every 
  opportunity to see the consequences of their actions, argue matters out and 
  correct themselves. That needed a collective effort at enlarging political space.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>Rajani&#146;s activism in challenging the arrest and torture 
  of students aroused considerable suspicion on the part of the Indian Army. Her 
  challenging the views and actions of students supportive of the LTTE, invited 
  the close and hostile scrutiny of the LTTE. It is a matter for satisfaction 
  that at that time no university student was detained and killed. The LTTE ordered 
  her assassination as soon as the Indian Army announced its departure &#150; 
  an outcome of the opportunism of Sinhalese politics that did not care about 
  consequences to the North-East. </span></p>
<p>Soon mass disappearances by the LTTE got under way, fully supported by the 
  Sri Lankan state. Several university students lost their lives in these purges. 
  Among them were students Manoharan and Chelvi who had been drawn by Rajani&#146;s 
  activism and continued to support the exiled UTHR(J). It is the singular tragedy 
  of the Tamils that many others of no less dedication and ability were murdered 
  for patriotic reasons by a force that despoiled them of all that a civilised 
  people holds dear, and left them utterly forlorn. </p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>Brave in the face of adversity, Rajani&#146;s activism was 
  based on mobilising the people to outflank all sources of oppression by building 
  structures: Structures that would enable the people to stand up collectively 
  for their dignity. The background given below is necessary to understand her 
  singular legacy. It was both non-violent and political, through people&#146;s 
  movements and not political parties. The recent war and the detention of up 
  to 300 000 IDPs exemplifies the void resulting from a perverted liberation struggle 
  and a mindless and heartless state.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>As a young medical doctor who had joined the staff of the 
  <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType w:st="on">University</st1:PlaceType> of 
  <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Jaffna</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>, Rajani was staying 
  with her parents along with her elder sister Nirmala. This was in 1982 and she 
  had no involvement with the LTTE, while her sister and brother-in-law were involved. 
  Dayapala was at home in January when the LTTE carried out its first major assassination 
  of a key rival, Sundaram of the PLOTE. Dayapala, among other concerned observers, 
  warned that this trend of assassination would lead to an immitigable tragedy. 
  In those early days when the PTA had alienated the community, state terror was 
  active and the LTTE was a small underground organisation, hardly anyone, even 
  if sympathetic, was willing to help injured cadres. Nirmala was in this respect 
  an exception. At a critical time when a doctor was urgently needed, Rajani, 
  though not involved, went out with her sister without any calculation to help 
  the injured. Although Nirmala was detained by the Army, Rajani had left for 
  doctoral studies in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">England</st1:place></st1:country-region> and her role remained a secret.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>This happened years before the LTTE was in control of Tamil 
  society, when it became fashionable for elite and religious leaders to flatter 
  it with their sycophancy. This connection took Rajani into the inner circles 
  of the LTTE in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Britain</st1:place></st1:country-region>. Again characteristically 
  of her, once she began to realise that the LTTE was a totalitarian organisation 
  that would destroy her community, she made a traumatic exit. By then the fears 
  about the direction of the Tamil insurgency were coming true. The culture of 
  assassination begun by the LTTE became epidemic among leading militant groups. 
  Their obsession with assassins, traitors and double agents led to an internal 
  bloodbath, which became public through dissidents in the PLOTE. </span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>Rajani&#146;s commitment to the people was such that rather 
  than remain in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Britain</st1:place></st1:country-region> 
  and seek a career in safety, she felt duty bound to go back home and challenge 
  the LTTE politically. She returned to <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Jaffna</st1:place></st1:City> 
  at the end of 1986. To many people the notion seemed lunacy, but none of us 
  who moved with her thought of it in that way. She was an immense source of strength 
  to many. Looking back over two decades, the singular aspect of her legacy is 
  the manner in which she inspired others to challenge the terror from a multiplicity 
  of sources: the Sri Lankan state, the LTTE, the Indian Army and the groups thoroughly 
  alienated by the LTTE&#146;s violence and wanting to get their own back.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>While the LTTE destroyed the personalities of the young whom 
  it absorbed, Rajani also understood the attraction such an organisation could 
  pose to idealistically minded youth who were alienated by the arrogance and 
  violence of the State. In all human decisions, we are often carried away and 
  turn a blind eye to some important aspect of the reality we confront. She understood 
  the oppressive conditions that drive the young to make mistakes. She felt responsible 
  to give the young the opportunity to come out of it. Knowing that it may cost 
  her, her life, she did not let it cloud her enjoyment of it, nor made others 
  conscious of the risk she ran.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>She was gentle with the young. Her anger was reserved for 
  the elite who abdicated their responsibility to engage with the Sinhalese forcefully 
  and non-violently and instead demonised them as a granite block of obduracy, 
  violence and intolerance. Their politics was intellectually lazy and morally 
  irresponsible. They were simply transferring to different actors the phobias 
  and prejudices of the dominant Sinhalese politics; and spurned overtures to 
  large sections of the Sinhalese people whom the corruption and nationalist bravado 
  of their leaders had left out in the cold.</span></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>It was the same apathy and lethargy of the Tamil elite that 
  shifted the burden onto the fragile shoulders of the emerging militants. In 
  the coming anarchy our society succumbed to internal terror, became callous 
  towards individuals who differed in their opinion and allowed the name of liberation 
  to be usurped by a fascistic formation, which in its flood of bloodletting carried 
  the Tamils along a suicidal path with no end in sight. This created in Rajani 
  a greater commitment to combat this trend rather than give in to general apathy 
  and disillusionment.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>The Marxist in her, also perhaps her Christian upbringing, 
  as with great men and women of other faiths, did not see death as the ineluctable 
  end that defeats all endeavour. An obsession with preserving life could be crippling, 
  and the value of a life is rather to be measured by how it was lived and the 
  legacy it leaves behind. She spurned individual heroism and tried to build a 
  legacy by the mobilisation of collective effort to build structures. The emergence 
  of UTHR(J) and it its activities in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Jaffna</st1:PlaceName> 
  <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">University</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> was seen by 
  Rajani as &#147;creating political space&#148; in an totalitarian environment.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>An important experiment that owes much to Rajani was the creation 
  of the University Staff, Students and Employees Consultative Committee, chaired 
  by the vice chancellor.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>It was meant to meet any threat to persons or the functioning 
  of the university through collective effort. The University, as long as it was 
  seen as the person of the vice chancellor and a few deans was a weak institution. 
  This was seen during the LTTE&#146;s abduction and murder of the student Vijitharan 
  in 1986 despite Vice Chancellor Prof. Vithyananthan&#146;s concerned personal 
  efforts to get the student freed. The LTTE easily manipulated the divided efforts 
  of the university community and the larger society.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>Rajani&#146;s other efforts such as creating a cooperative 
  of women victims were meant to create structures that would outlive individuals 
  and leave behind a legacy to benefit the poorer sections. </span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>Eventually Rajani gave her life for her commitment to the 
  people she loved so much. She strongly felt that teaching students is not simply 
  giving lectures in theatres but harnessing their inherent potential to make 
  them useful to the community. From this flowed her empathy towards each student 
  in her class, with whom she spent time discussing a variety of issues. But the 
  politics which dominated the society used some of the students on whom she lavished 
  care as agents of her killers. Some of them have left the country and done well 
  as healers. Rajani would not have grudged this, except to wish that they think 
  back and reexamine their actions and the untold suffering they helped to unloose 
  on the people through their services to a totalitarian organisation, one that 
  inevitably destroyed itself taking thousands with them.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>The writing of the Broken Palmyra, the formation of UTHR (J) 
  and other endeavours where Rajani played a crucial and leading role, were an 
  outcome of real life experiences through which we journeyed, sharing the dangers 
  faced by the people, trying to understand the political and social dynamisms 
  which entrapped the country in violent conflicts. We have seen how ordinary 
  people were entrapped by all sides and how their insecurity and fears were used 
  to justify and perpetuate war with unimaginable consequences.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>In the tragic decades after independence President Kumaratunge 
  was unique in showing a clear ability to understand the root causes of the ethnic 
  conflict and acknowledge openly that the minorities needed political space. 
  But too much effort was wasted in trying to get agreement from the LTTE, which 
  wanted no settlement, and restarted the war to avoid one. Meanwhile what the 
  minorities saw of the state was the same Sinhalese state using the war to further 
  centralise its activities and keep the minorities out. What the Tamils especially 
  experienced was the same brutal state covering up its violations and forcing 
  them to stand with outstretched hands before the Sinhalese administrative and 
  military <i>zamindars</i> for their basic needs. No effort was made to reactivate 
  the North-East Provincial Council or to give the Tamils any real power over 
  their own affairs.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>Many Tamils willing to take risks and cooperate with Kumaratunge 
  finished up giving their lives for shoddy returns. Mayors of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Jaffna</st1:place></st1:City> 
  and senior politicians, Mrs. Yogeswaran and Sivapalan gave their lives having 
  received no more authority than to sweep the streets of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Jaffna</st1:place></st1:City>. Many members of the EPRLF, PLOTE and 
  EPDP, like T. Subathiran, gave their lives for being mere local councillors, 
  when with their commitment and experience they could have been used with far 
  greater effect. It reinforced the LTTE&#146;s contention that the Sinhalese 
  would never give the Tamils their due and the dead were traitors who provided 
  cover for Sinhalese oppression dressed up in mere promises. </span></p>
<h3><a name=Past></a><a name="_Toc240702630"><span
lang=EN-US>2. Forgetting the Past &amp; Warring against Truth</span></a></h3>
<p><span lang=EN-US>Today the LTTE has been crushed, and in spite of the tragedy 
  there was an opportunity for the leaders to open a new chapter. But once more 
  they are failing the people. They are doing nothing to empower progressive Tamils 
  to challenge the ideology of violent Tamil nationalism which thrived in the 
  name of challenging the institutionalised Sinhalese chauvinism of the State. 
  Instead, the rulers continue to use the state machinery for a narrow political 
  agenda, further undermining democratic institutions. The ruling elite in the 
  South have not learned any lessons and continue to give life to Tamil narrow 
  nationalism. </span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>War, though sometimes legitimate and inevitable carries its 
  price. When it leads to pervasive suppression of truth as regards the manner 
  in which humanitarian norms were transgressed, the weaponry used, all for the 
  dogmatic aim of decapitating the LTTE leadership in the name of hostage rescue; 
  the wounds easily become septic. It is now abundantly clear that the IDPs are 
  being detained to suppress the true facts about the &#145;hostage rescue&#146;. 
  It is again a fact that many injured were allowed to die and others starved 
  because the Government refused permission for the ICRC to collect the injured 
  and deliver supplies over the final nine days.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>A government that accuses those who raise these questions 
  as traitors, detaining some as an example to others, routinely extending detention 
  on flimsy grounds, while it clutches at straws fishing for charges, before having 
  judges plonk heavy sentences on them, degrades intelligence and everything a 
  democracy holds sacred. When someone is deemed a criminal the charges must be 
  precise and justifiable in law. </span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>The Tissainayagam trial is one where the prosecution was fumbling 
  with charges such as &#145;bringing disrepute to the government&#146; by collecting 
  evidence of war crimes in the East, which were then found not to be an offence. 
  The case was argued on the draconian provisions of the PTA which played a crucial 
  role in driving many youths to join militant movements. After the crushing of 
  the LTTE, at least, the President should have shown statesmanship and advised 
  the AG&#146;s department to withdraw the case and signal a new beginning. Instead, 
  he allowed the prosecution to continue its arguments based mainly on the prejudices 
  and political presuppositions of the Sinhalese ruling class: Was for example 
  shelling the Tamil people on the run all the way from Sampoor to Valaichchenai 
  in 2006, and denying those especially from Sampoor the right of return, a war 
  crime? Or, was it their liberation from terrorism and therefore a humanitarian 
  action? The &#145;legal&#146; proceedings against Tissainayagam were political 
  from start to finish. </span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>It was the same with locking up the war zone doctors. Dr. 
  Kohona, Sri Lanka&#146;s newly appointed ambassador to the UN answering a question 
  by <i>Himal</i> (August 2009), declared that Dr. Varathrajah had claimed &#145;irrationally&#146; 
  that the Air Force was dropping cluster bombs. It was rather the UN spokesman 
  who said in early February 2009 that artillery fired cluster munitions had been 
  used near Puthukkudiyiruppu Hospital and played it down under government pressure. 
  Locking up someone without any clear idea of his offence and then fumbling for 
  charges is a practice of the worst regimes, bringing disrepute to the legal 
  profession, especially when they fail to protest.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>It leads to a culture of impunity when the Police and security 
  forces are empowered to detain persons indefinitely on the most facile grounds, 
  torture or even kill. The public knows beforehand which cases would be hushed 
  up. In the case of the killing of five Tamil students in Trincomalee in 2006, 
  the people know exactly what happened and the name of the senior police officer 
  who orchestrated the incident. But the witnesses were threatened and the case 
  was hushed up first in the local court and then at the much hyped Presidential 
  Commission of Inquiry. The same fate befell the case of the 17 Action Contra 
  la Faim aid workers killed.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>This culture would soon come to haunt the Sinhalese as in 
  two publicised cases of police brutality in August 2009. One case of abduction 
  and grievous assault concerned SSP Vaas Gunawardene. The victim was a college 
  student, his son&#146;s rival. But all the horrors in the East where Gunawardene 
  was posted before being brought to <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Colombo</st1:place></st1:City> have been kept away from the Sinhalese 
  or distorted. One incident was the uninvestigated political killing of the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Koneswaram</st1:PlaceName> 
  <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Temple</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> priest who was critical 
  of the violence of the authorities. The fake encounter killing of the alleged 
  killers of six-year old Varsha who was kidnapped for ransom has raised many 
  questions among the people of Trincomalee. The kidnappers, some of them in a 
  paramilitary group, had worked very closely with the security forces. The encounter 
  killings were by policemen under Vaas Gunawardene. The case was hushed up by 
  the murder of suspects, circumventing the courts.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>The Tamils lost confidence in the State and the security forces 
  a long time ago. It would not be long before the Sinhalese too feel the sting 
  as they did in the latter 1980s. A nation in which the people know the truth 
  and has healthy democratic structures that cannot easily be subverted, is far 
  more likely to make mature decisions. What obtains in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Sri Lanka</st1:place></st1:country-region> is that 
  the entire process of governance, the police and the courts are subverted to 
  cover up the crimes of a small coterie that controls power. In the recently 
  concluded war the obsession with the suppression of truth seems to have no logical 
  end. The imprisonment of IDPs is just the thin end of the wedge.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>If the Government believes that the war was a great military 
  achievement, let the Sinhalese people know the truth and understand the consequences. 
  The suppression of truth also meant an attack on Sinhalese who were determined 
  to expose it. There was a steady build up of terror against journalists who 
  reported on the war culminating in the assassination of <i>Sunday Leader</i> 
  editor Lasantha Wickrematunge, when several other journalists too were intimidated 
  out of the country. This coincided with the final drive to end the war, just 
  after the fall of Killinochchi on <st1:date Month="1" Day="1" Year="2009" w:st="on">1<sup>st</sup> 
  January 2009</st1:date> and days before fleeing refugees, increasingly constricted 
  in space, began experiencing widespread aerial and artillery bombardment. The 
  latter included the use of cluster munitions (<i>kotthu kundu</i>), and from 
  April white phosphorous munitions (<i>eri kundu</i>).</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>We have cross-checked reports of people from the war zone 
  that the LTTE did provoke the Army at times, such as by firing from behind <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Puthukkudiyiruppu</st1:PlaceName> 
  <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Hospital</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>. On such occasions 
  the Army&#146;s return fire was quite accurate, although it was mainly civilians 
  that suffered. But otherwise regular shelling by the Army, including with cluster 
  shells, fell all over with many civilian casualties. Medicines and staff were 
  very short at <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Putumattalan</st1:PlaceName> 
  <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Hospital</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>, and about 25% 
  of those injured, especially in the head and stomach, were allowed to die in 
  order to help those with a greater chance of survival until the ICRC ship arrived. 
  In the latter stages, from 11<sup>th</sup> May the hospital in Mullivaykkal 
  even lacked the capacity for rudimentary dressings, when ICRC was not given 
  clearance by the Government to deliver supplies and collect the injured. During 
  the final stages of the war, 16<sup>th</sup> &#150; 18<sup>th</sup> May, hundreds 
  of injured without help were left on the roadside, including young injured LTTE 
  girls, who were begging for cyanide capsules or for someone to take them along.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>Both sides abused the people, but the final feeling among 
  those who survived is that, even though individual soldiers showed concern towards 
  the civilians once they escaped from the war zone, the Government did not treat 
  them as human beings. The number of civilian deaths in 2009, which we earlier 
  estimated at 13 000 (<a
href="http://www.himalmag.com/Doctoring-the-evidence_nw3217.html">http://www.himalmag.com/Doctoring-the-evidence_nw3217.html</a> 
  ), must now be placed significantly higher. The civilians were driven from Viswamadu 
  to Putumattalan by relentless shelling and aerial bombardment amidst Tiger shelling 
  sometimes intended to provoke the Army. The Army was intent on making life so 
  miserable for the civilians the LTTE held hostage that they would die or flee 
  to government-controlled territory leaving them free to decapitate the LTTE 
  leadership. It must be remembered that on 17<sup>th</sup> May just before the 
  final push the Government announced that all civilians had left the No Fire 
  Zone, when there were yet more than 30 000, and moved in dropping grenades into 
  civilian bunkers. The casualty estimate above relied heavily on the numbers 
  of injured taken for treatment by the ICRC and others treated at Vavuniya by 
  MSF. That must now be taken as misleading as very many injured died for the 
  lack or absence of timely medical aid. The number of young LTTE conscripts who 
  died in the last five months may be around 6000. </span></p>
<h3><a name=Task></a><a name="_Toc240702631"><span
lang=EN-US>3. Rajani&#146;s Unfinished Task</span></a></h3>
<p><span lang=EN-US>It was under similar conditions after the LTTE provoked the 
  Indian Army into war in 1987, although with deaths on a much smaller scale, 
  when Rajani and some of her colleagues set about writing the <i>Broken Palmyra</i> 
  with a view to placing in public how the civilians were victimised by all the 
  armed parties. Rajani busied herself talking to hospital staff to write about 
  how the LTTE firing at the advancing Indian Army column and running away resulted 
  in scores of civilians and staff being killed by the latter. She talked to families 
  where women had been raped. We recorded how an LTTE provocation of firing at 
  a tank from Kokkuvil Hindu and escaping resulted in a tank firing a shell at 
  a classroom killing 30 refugees.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>Rajani had no illusions about the LTTE and was in greater 
  danger as an ex-LTTEer challenging the outfit. One cannot fully explain the 
  rationality or otherwise of decisions taken long ago. It was as an act of meaningful 
  defiance that we decided that the book should be published with the names of 
  all the authors. The preprint edition was well received by our Sinhalese colleagues 
  in the South and was widely photocopied. </span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>If Rajani were alive today she would have done the same for 
  the victims of the war now ended and challenged the ideologues on both sides 
  who boast of their military genius at the expense of the people. She would not 
  have stopped there. She believed that the people should be mobilised and structures 
  built to consolidate their gains. In 1987, the first act in which she played 
  a leading role was to talk to the Indian Army and reopen the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType w:st="on">University</st1:PlaceType> 
  of <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Jaffna</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>, as an available 
  structure that could become a base for others. She was sometimes almost alone 
  in the Medical Faculty with a few loyal labourers getting the Anatomy Department 
  back into shape.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>We may record here that when the Indian Army found out about 
  the preprint edition of the Broken Palmyra they quickly acquired copies and 
  we were told that three different intelligence teams were assessing them. They 
  were annoyed, harassed us a little, sometimes on spurious intelligence, but 
  generally took it up as well as one might expect. While fighting the LTTE and 
  setting up the conscript Tamil National Army was dirty business, there was also 
  at some level in the Indian Army sensitivity to democratic freedoms.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>The recent killing and intimidation of journalists and the 
  political prosecution against Tissainayagam and the detention of National Christian 
  Council Secretary Shantha Fernando without any charge, besides shutting up the 
  IDPs and silencing of the war zone doctors, have all the suggestion of preemptive 
  steps against any criticism or investigative reporting of the recent war. A 
  terrorised media has largely fallen into line. It is sad to see a number of 
  journalists, barred from questioning the State, exercising their semantic talents 
  in ungenerous, trivial ex-parte attacks on those like the war zone doctors, 
  whom the Government loves to hate; but with no acknowledgement of the yeoman 
  service they performed under inhuman conditions, losing some of their staff 
  to shell fire. One accusation, revealing for its refusal to understand the harsh 
  ground reality, is against a war zone doctor, for pronouncing death due to starvation 
  of 13 people without performing autopsies!</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>This is how a nervous government, unable to acknowledge the 
  war has ended and keeping up synthetically a mood of grave military threat from 
  the decimated LTTE, wants the Sinhalese to view the problem. The oldest dissidents 
  on record, the Prophets of Israel, made it uncompromisingly clear that warring 
  against truth and denying justice makes a people small, and the state brittle. 
  That is today the main challenge facing the Sinhalese, against a government 
  that wants to make them a small people. </span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>Patriotism has been narrowed to represent the interest of 
  a section of a ruling clique. All criticism of how the war was waged is equated 
  with treachery. Arrogance of Power is so open and naked, that the state is losing 
  all inhibitions against undermining the rule of law. The Sinhalese would need 
  to take courage and face up to what the war cost not only the Tamils, but also 
  the Sinhalese. The Government has made a gross understatement with regard to 
  the number of soldiers killed, claiming it was a small fraction of LTTE cadres 
  killed. The casualty rate of soldiers: LTTE was about 1:1 in 2002. When the 
  truth is patriotically suppressed, it also means the suffering and loss resulting 
  from subaltern Sinhalese youth killed and maimed charging through mined ditches, 
  is being hidden by elites gloating over a great victory. The tears of the bereaved 
  become an embarrassment. </span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>The problems of all communities who have suffered bereavement 
  are similar. They are the most neglected sections of all ethnic groups. UTHR(J) 
  does not believe that we could advance by simply forgetting the past. The past 
  and the political sins of the fathers are too much and too long with us. There 
  has been no accounting for the communal violence unleashed several times in 
  one form or another since 1956. Denial of justice has been subconsciously assimilated 
  into malefic assumptions by which the State functions &#150; that the minorities 
  are undesirables to be kicked around as scapegoats for the failures of the rulers. 
  Little wonder that the State must somehow resurrect its deceased offspring, 
  the LTTE. </span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>The need of the hour is to resist attempts to pervert our 
  democratic legacy and to break with the past and to lay out a clear demarcation 
  to reorganise our social and political institutions to manage the conflict and 
  to focus on issues, which are important for poverty alleviation and economic 
  development. All the development plans in the North and East are based on the 
  illusionary belief that when a people is weak it is easy to consolidate political 
  control by showing some tokens of economic development, without any concept 
  of accountability or participation of the community. </span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>If the rulers do not trust the people, especially the Tamils, 
  and try to impose their control, not only will they fail, but will also keep 
  divisionary politics alive. If the Government could initiate a broader process 
  in which all communities could reevaluate their past and work out a political 
  arrangement which would allow the different communities political and cultural 
  space to participate as equals in decision making, then there would be hope. 
  If the country is to become great, it must be ruled by a broad democratic consensus. 
  A country represented by a royal president and his hangers on would remain conflict-prone, 
  weak and a tragic laughing stock among nations. </span></p>
<p>At this point the Tamils who have been browbeaten by decades of war need political 
  space to manage affairs of their reconstruction and to overcome or expiate the 
  legacies of state violence and fascist control. It would only be then that they 
  could work with other communities without fear. We end with quotations from 
  the Post Script to the Broken Palmyra written by Rajani in 1989 (Vol.II, Ch.9) 
  and &#145;<i>Laying Aside Illusions</i>&#146; (Appendix IV), a statement by 
  50 teachers of the University of Jaffna in 1988, where Rajani&#146;s contribution 
  comes through clearly. These give insights into Rajani&#146;s thinking and, 
  sadly, reveal the country&#146;s propensity to forget the past and arrive back 
  where we began twenty years ago, with everything in place for reenactment: 
  </p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>&#147;<i>If our earlier account had appeared to be &#145;plugging 
  a line&#146;, as some would want to put it, it was because it was important 
  for us to arrive at a synthesis in analysis, seek an understanding, find spaces 
  to organise, and revitalise a community that was sinking into a state of resignation. 
  Objectivity was not solely an academic exercise for us. Objectivity, the pursuit 
  of truth and the propagation of critical and honest positions, was crucial for 
  the community. But they could also cost many of us our lives. Any involvement 
  with them was undertaken only as a survival task</i>&#133;</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>&#147;<i>Within this tragic history there is still an attempt 
  by concerned people to think coherently of the future. There are debates going 
  on as to the correct path for survival, organisation and possible breakthroughs. 
  There is, especially in the North, a limited attempt at organising at the grass-roots 
  level, so as to handle the repressive situation and violence from all sides. 
  These are very small beginnings indeed&#133;For the people, any solution to 
  the brutal and intense violence has to come from within the communities and 
  cannot be imposed from outside. The development of these internal structures 
  is a long and arduous task, a process which is only just beginning to be comprehended</i>.&#148;</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>Finally we quote from &#145;<i>Laying aside Illusions</i>&#146;, 
  which emphasises democratic organisation and a collective response:</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>&#147;<i>Our obeisance to terror within the community, and 
  our opportunism and lack of principles in the face of many internal killings, 
  have made it easy for external forces to use the same weapons to control us&#133;Thus 
  if the people are to regain their lost self-will and dignity, they will have 
  to move towards a principled collective response. We have to assert universal 
  values to which we are both emotionally and intellectually committed. <br>
  It is the lack of such commitment that enabled us to come to terms with murder, 
  when it concerned others&#146; sons, and then, watch helplessly in panic when 
  the cancer, allowed to grow, threatened our own sons. We are now paying the 
  price for our past indifference</i>&#133;</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>&#147;<i>As individuals or small groups in our neighbourhoods, 
  places of work, unions or associations, we must question our past, understand 
  where we went wrong, and rediscover our principles. We must be conscious of 
  the message of past experience, that in standing up for others we also stand 
  up for ourselves. This course requires courage; and, no other is open to us. 
  We have tried to play safe in the past. The result was mass murder from several 
  sources. Non-combatant civilians too became unarmed front-line troops facing 
  the wrath of advancing armies. The future looks even more bleak, with the rapid 
  growth and consolidation in southern <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Sri 
  Lanka</st1:place></st1:country-region> of forces of narrow political vision. 
  This opens the door for further involvement by external forces. Let us not remain 
  forever unprepared and continue trapped in the logic of passivity - hoping against 
  hope that someone else will bring us deliverance</i>.&#148;</span></p>
