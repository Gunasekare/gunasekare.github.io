<h1 align="center"><strong>Rajani  and the Tamil National Struggle</strong></h1>
<p><br>
  Every death, as  Rajani said, is a monumental tragedy that needs to be accounted for and the  moment we lose that human empathy and become apathetic or indifferent, we are,  as a people, doomed. While death and loss was not confined to one community, we  Tamils believed in the liberation struggle, lost a great deal, sheltered behind  apathy while many of our best were killed as traitors and children of the  vulnerable sections dragooned off to fight a doomed war. We are now the living  dead, corrupt and subservient, unable to run the institutions we have for the  public good, appeasing the new order by pretending that the liberation struggle  was something we had no part in, and those who died for it as completely alien  to us. With her keen understanding of society and the dangerous shallowness of narrow  elite nationalism, Rajani foresaw this betrayal as her writings in the Broken  Palmyra show. She saw it was the poor and downtrodden who were at the receiving  end. Her ears and heart were open to all; she pleaded that to avert our common  dismal fate, our politics should become more open, and we should reach out to  the wider world as a people deserving sympathy&hellip;<br>
  While being an  internationalist from her university days, Rajani joined the LTTE as a reaction  to the hypocrisy of Tamil nationalist politics, upon seeing, first as a doctor,  the sacrificial earnestness of some LTTE cadres. She left in disgust upon being  exposed to the trauma of young persons, whose sacrifice was being cynically  betrayed. As with Tamil nationalist parliamentary politics, she saw that the  LTTE was a prisoner of its rhetoric of Tamil valour and its heroic destiny and  could only impose greater sacrifices on an unwilling people and severe  repression against those who questioned it, while being drawn into new and  malign forms of dependence. Nationalism when admired for its military feats has  been a source of dangerous delusions.<br>
  The stunning  victory of the Japanese against the Russian Navy, then a major European Imperial  Power, in the Tsushima Strait in 1905, charged up nationalist movements from  China and Vietnam to India, Turkey and the Islamic World with fresh fervour for  throwing off European Imperial dominance and asseting national independence. But  they lost sight of the fact that Nationalism was already an outmoded and gangrenous  sore. Japan&rsquo;s was not an agenda for the liberation of Asia, but an imperial  agenda for posession, particularly Manchuria and Korea. Its victory was not  made in Japan but in current imperial rivalies, and the Japanese Navy was armed  largely by Britain. Japan&rsquo;s hubris eventually led to the tragedy of Hiroshima  and Nagasaki.<br>
  We failed to  appreciate that nationalism was ultimately predatory in character. Once the  beast of nationalism is awakened, its depredations as we have seen may be more  insidious and incurable when exercised by groups within the whimsical  boundaries of modern states. The predatory spirit of nationalism inspired by  Japan&rsquo;s victory, marred the independence of nations. Take education.<br>
  After 65 years  of independence, why do we still hold degrees and doctorates from western  nations in high regard and treat ours with increasing skepticism? Did we not  have the potential for our universities to equal Oxford and Cambridge? The failure  has much to do with our partisanship and violence that are an aspect of  nationalism, which made impunity tolerable when the victim was not in our  group. For us, the disenfranchisement of Plantation Labour of recent Indian  origin in 1948 using tenuous arguments founded on Legal Positivism, then the  vogue in English Law, brought us to Sinhalese majoritarianism and frequently,  total eclipse of the rule of law. In India it begun with the trauma of  Partition that owed to the refusal of Hindu Nationalists to treat the Muslims  as equals. In both instances the predatory aspect of nationalism stunted us and  our institutions. As an internationalist and a keen participant in solidarity  movements across national boundaries, and an early supporter of the African  National Congress, Rajani understood this and in the development of her  thinking distinguished between narrow nationalism and the kind of nationalism  dictated by the defence of a community and struggled to maintain that  distinction against the noxious rhetorical legacy of a bankrupt parliamentary  nationalism, which had legitimised the murder of so-called traitors. Some left  militant groups too tried and failed.<br>
  As one whose  perceptions were moulded by state-complicity in communal violence, Rajani accepted  the Tamil Nation as forced upon us by events, but whose materialisation was  conditional upon the Tamils&rsquo; success in nation-building, to include Muslims and  Hill-Country Tamils in a concrete, rather than superficial, working  relationship with mechanisms to address mutual grievances. It meant building  people&rsquo;s institutions to mitigate harmful dependencies, both locally and  internationally. Part of her advocacy was her leading role in forging in this  University, the Staff, Students and Employees Consultative Committee, chaired  by the Vice Chancellor, where members talked as equals to resolve problems. It challenged  the LTTE&rsquo;s attempt to control the University, and foundered once Rajani was  assassinated.<br>
  Rajani&rsquo;s worst  fears of the narrow Tamil nationalism forged by the elite in response to  Sinhalese supremacism, found its searing denouement in the bloodied sands of  Mattalan and Mullivaykkal in 2009, and the continuing paralysis of Tamil  society. What is Rajani&rsquo;s message to this society today? Maria Remarque, a  young German soldier who fought in the ruinous First World War, in his  masterpiece &lsquo;All Quiet on the Western Front&rsquo;, left us a powerful critique of  his country&rsquo;s nationalist excess and the young&rsquo;s total disillusionment with the  older generation and the service of the State they preached: &ldquo;[they were]  convinced that they were acting for the best, in the way that was most  comfortable for themselves&hellip;[to us] that was the very root of their moral bankruptcy&hellip;we  saw there was nothing left of their world. Suddenly we found ourselves horribly  alone.&rdquo;<br>
  We see it today  in the intellectual barrenness that characterises the University, and the near  absence of discussion and engagement between the academic staff and the  students. The generation responsible for this plight hides its bankruptcy by  not allowing the young to think. They are being exhorted to more tradition and  more religion and are rendering our political future hopeless by dismantling  secularism &ndash; the only basis for a united Tamil Nation &ndash; that even the militant  movements paid lip-service to. Tamils&rsquo; internal destructivess, combined with  the Sinhalese establishment&rsquo;s quest for complete victory over truth about the  recent war in particular, and history in general, renders the situation more  volatile.&nbsp; <br>
  Could one  pronounce judgment on the character of the recently ended war without a fair  estimate of the casualties? Could one make such an estimate after throwing away  primary data about the number of civilians in the war zone given by the leading  government official in charge of those civilians, and not gainsaid by the LLRC,  as simply cooked up? Was shelling civilians on the run all the way from Sampoor  to Batticaloa in August 2006, then going back on the promise of allowing  civilians to return, and turning over Sampoor to a crony capitalist as a zone  for heavy industry, a benign and professional military operation, or primarily an  ideological operation?<br>
  Particular  versions imposed with state-backing leads to anger among the victims silenced  by pervasive fear, and is reflected in the fertility of sentiments that gave  birth to the LTTE in Tamil politics. The resulting Dialogue of the Deaf augurs  ill for a united Lanka. <br>
How do we  respond? In writing the Broken Palmyra in late 1987 and early 1988, the authors  had different perspectives. One was the simple belief that the truth is greater  than ourselves, and the truth in itself has curative power. Rajani and  Sritharan went much further and wanted to make it a people&rsquo;s narrative through  which the people hold their oppressors of every hue to account and seek ways to  build their collective strength. The book could not have been what it is  without their constant engagement with victims left to their misery in villages  and hovels.</p>
