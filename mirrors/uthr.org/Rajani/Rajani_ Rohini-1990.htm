<p align=center style='text-align:center'><b><span lang=EN-US>THE IMPORTANCE OF 
  KEEPING RAJANI&#146;S FEMINISM ALIVE</span></b></p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><b>Memorial speech delivered by Rohini 
  Hensman</b></p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><b>12th October 1990</b></p>
<span lang=EN-US>I should begin by explaining that I never actually met Rajani. 
I missed her when she visited <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Britain</st1:place></st1:country-region> last year, and at that time 
thought there would surely be other opportunities to meet her, either in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Sri Lanka</st1:place></st1:country-region>, <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> or <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Britain</st1:place></st1:country-region></span><span lang=EN-US>. 
So it was a great shock to hear shortly afterwards that she had been killed. I 
felt both grief and anger that someone who had so much potential to contribute 
to Tamil thought and culture, Sri Lankan thought and culture, and <i>world</i> 
thought and culture, should have been cut off prematurely by such a brutal and 
senseless act. I still feel today that it is an enormous loss to all of us, I 
still feel angry </span><span lang=EN-US>about the cowardly way in which she was 
murdered. While we mourn her death, we cannot fail to condemn those who inflicted 
it.</span> 
<p><span lang=EN-US>However, Rajani is not completely lost to us. Those of us 
  who were lucky enough to know her personally have memories of her; all of us 
  have her writings and what we know of her life. We have the power, if we wish, 
  to keep her spirit alive in our own activity; and I think it is crucially important 
  that we do so, not only for Rajani&#146;s sake but also for the sake of the 
  movement to which she dedicated her life.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>I want to talk about one aspect of her work which I feel is 
  especially important, and that is her work in the women&#146;s liberation movement. 
  As someone who has been active in the feminist movement in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>, 
  I know the kind of misconceptions that many people have about the movement, 
  which Rajani too must have had to contend with. For example, that it is a movement 
  which is important <i>only</i> for women. It is not: it is equally important 
  for children and men, and I would like to explain why I feel, from my own experience, 
  that no movement for self-determination or social liberation can be successful 
  unless it incorporates the kind of feminism which Rajani stood for.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>Some time ago, I read somewhere a man asking whether the emancipation 
  of women would lead to more women participating in the armed struggle. This 
  is a very common view, but it is completely wrong. Feminism aims for relationships 
  of equality and mutual respect between women and men, but this does <i>not</i> 
  mean that we want women to be the same as what men are today. For example, in 
  most societies of the world, virtually all the caring work &#150; for sick or 
  disabled people, elderly people, and especially for children &#150; is done 
  by women. This is often thought to be a &#145;natural&#146; division of labour, 
  but there is nothing innate about it. You don&#146;t need to have your own child 
  in order to care for a child; in fact, in our South Asian societies, you often 
  see little girls looking after smaller children. Caring, like any other occupation, 
  involves the learning of skills and acquiring of conditioned reflexes which 
  change you as a person. If you&#146;ve ever cared for a small child or a very 
  sick person, you will know how precious the life of the person you are caring 
  for becomes to you, how sensitive you become to the other person&#146;s pain, 
  almost to the point of feeling it in your own body. And these are not responses 
  which can easily be switched on and off; as I said, they are more like conditioned 
  reflexes which are incorporated into your nervous system and become <i>part 
  of you.</i> This is a biological feature, but a neurophysiological one acquired 
  in your lifetime rather than a genetic one you are born with. In other words, 
  a carer is a certain type of person, with certain responses that have become 
  ingrained. I cannot conceive of the possibility that anyone who has been a long-term 
  carer could become a torturer or killer &#150; or, for that matter, a rapist, 
  since rape too involves the deliberate infliction of injury on another person 
  &#150; unless that person undergoes a violent process whereby his or her whole 
  personality is changed. And I think this explains why so few women are torturers 
  or killers. It is not a genetic difference which prevents them, as we know from 
  the few cases where women <i>have</i> actually entered these male professions. 
  Nor is there anything genetic preventing men from being carers, as we know from 
  the few cases where they have taken to it like ducks to water.It is the social 
  training and acquired instincts of women that prevent them from torturing and 
  killing. As feminists, we want an equal sharing of caring work between men and 
  women; and I am sure that if this occurs, the recruiting-ground for torturers 
  and killers will shrink rapidly. So equality between women and men will mean 
  that in this respect men will become more like women, not the other way around.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>So now we have a society in which the female half has this 
  invaluable resource, the capacity for sustaining life and relieving pain. You 
  would expect that this outlook would express itself in society to the same extent 
  as the opposite tendency. But this is not the case: militarism and violence 
  always seem to win out. Why is this? Because the same division of labour which 
  makes women carers, also confines them largely to the domestic sphere and keeps 
  them out of public life. So they <i>have</i> the resource, but they can&#146;t 
  <i>use</i> it except in a very narrow sphere. One reason is simply lack of time. 
  Even if they go out to work, the burden of domestic responsibilities is so heavy 
  that they have no time to participate in public life and put forward their own 
  point of view. Secondly, there are all kinds of social sanctions against women 
  who don&#146;t accept confinement to the sphere to which they have been allotted 
  by society: gossip, slander, ostracism and so forth. In extreme cases, sexual 
  violence is used to &#145;keep them in their place&#146;. In <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>, we have 
  come across many instances where rape is used as a political weapon against 
  women activists. And fear of sexual violence may sometimes be an effective deterrent 
  where other sanctions fail. Finally, there are the ingrained habits of women 
  themselves. Along with the skills of caring, we acquire the habits of deference, 
  passivity and silence, and thus we never get a chance to acquire skills of expression 
  and organisation in a wider context. So we find ourselves at a loss in public 
  life, unable to achieve very much even on the rare occasions when the opportunity 
  arises. In this respect, women really do need to become more like men, to learn 
  how to project the outlook acquired in their caring work outward, into the whole 
  of society. Rajani showed us in practice that this is possible, even in a highly 
  conservative, male-dominated society, and set an example for all women to follow.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>I&#146;m sure that all of us here have at one time or another 
  heard a parent say threateningly to a child, &#145;You do such-and-such because 
  <i>I</i> say so,&#146; and seen disobedience punished with a slap or something 
  worse, or have been in a household where whatever the male head says is law. 
  But what do you think must be the effect on children if they grow up in such 
  a context? They become used to authoritarianism from the very beginning: to 
  a set-up where the power of male over female, adult over child, stronger over 
  weaker, is taken for granted, where arbitrary demands are backed up by violence. 
  They see a hierarchy where you have to obey those who are above you but can 
  demand obedience from those who are below, and they come to accept this as natural 
  because they have never experienced anything else. So it is hardly surprising 
  that when they grow up, they find no difficulty in accepting an authoritarian, 
  hierarchical society where the head of state occupies a position analogous to 
  the head of the family. And even if they object to the particular government 
  in power and want to change it, their alternative will tend to have the same 
  authoritarian, hierarchical structure, because from their earliest childhood 
  they have come to see the world as being organised on this model. I think this 
  is the tragedy of <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Sri Lanka</st1:place></st1:country-region> today. 
  But the hierarchical, authoritarian family which breeds these hierarchical, 
  authoritarian individuals and attitudes is precisely one of the main targets 
  of the feminist movement, which also challenges social and political authoritarianism. 
  Rajani was killed because not enough people joined her in challenging the numerous 
  authoritarian forces active in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Sri Lanka</st1:place></st1:country-region>. We 
  may not be able to match her courage, but we can follow her example by collectively 
  challenging authoritarianism in the family and in the country.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>Finally, we have found in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> that revivalist, 
  communal movements are always extremely authoritarian and patriarchal; there 
  seems to be a link between intolerance and hatred of those with ethnic or religious 
  differences, and an authoritarian outlook which is oppressive to women. So the 
  women&#146;s movement has also had to combat revivalist movements which are 
  responsible for communal tension and violence.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US>What I&#146;m trying to say is this: the feminism that I&#146;m 
  talking about and which Rajani represented has to be <i>an essential part</i> 
  of any movement for social justice or peace. It is not an optional extra or 
  something which comes &#145;afterwards&#146; &#150; after self-determination, 
  or liberation, or anything else. The struggle for women&#146;s liberation has 
  to be an integral part of the overall movement, and if it is not, then there 
  is something wrong with that movement. This is why, in addition to commemorating 
  Rajani and celebrating her life, we must also continue her work. We cannot let 
  it stop.</span></p>
