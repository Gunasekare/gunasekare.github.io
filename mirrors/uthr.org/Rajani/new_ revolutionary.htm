  Thiranagama )</span></i></h4>
<p style='line-height:13.5pt'><span style='font-size:9.5pt;font-family:&quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;
color:black'>On the morning of 22 September 1989 I was asked to come to a safe 
  house in Colombo to receive an urgent message from Jaffna. Some friends of mine&nbsp;were 
  waiting there with a messenger who had come from Jaffna and&nbsp;who had had 
  lunch with <span class=SpellE>Rajani</span> on the previous day. She wasted 
  no time or words in delivering the message. &quot;Your wife, <span class=SpellE>Rajani</span>,&nbsp;was 
  shot by a gunman yesterday afternoon on her way home from the university. She 
  was fatally wounded in the attack. Your children are with their grandparents.&quot; 
  The woman herself was deeply shocked and was in a state of distress. It would 
  have been the most difficult message she had to ever deliver to a totally unknown 
  person within such a short time in such a few words. I still remember the incredible 
  speed&nbsp;with which my head started spinning and how speechless I was.&nbsp; 
  </span></p>
<p style='line-height:13.5pt'><span style='font-size:9.5pt;font-family:&quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;
color:black'>The woman who brought the message of <span class=SpellE>Rajani&#146;s</span> 
  death for me in Colombo later became an invaluable friend who was right beside 
  our&nbsp;family&#146;s side in London whenever we needed support.</span></p>
<p style='line-height:13.5pt'><span class=SpellE><span style='font-size:9.5pt;
font-family:&quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:black'>Rajani</span></span><span
style='font-size:9.5pt;font-family:"Verdana","sans-serif";color:black'> demonstrated 
  an extraordinary courage and unwavering commitment in her quest for justice 
  and human dignity against all the parties embroiled in a brutal armed conflict 
  where the lives of ordinary masses were placed at risk of displacement and death. 
  Women and the children had to bear the brunt of it. <span
class=GramE>Between 1987-89</span> the Tamil people had to witness the most destructive 
  war the community had ever seen between the Tamil Tigers and the Sri Lankan 
  army and then it continued unabated between the Tamil Tigers and the Indian 
  Peace Keeping Force (IPKF). In the Sinhalese south the situation became alarming 
  as the JVP started assassinating the left activists who supported the devolution 
  of power to the Tamil people under the 13th amendment.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style='line-height:13.5pt'><span style='font-size:9.5pt;font-family:&quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;
color:black'>This account of <span class=SpellE>Rajani&#146;s</span> life attempts 
  to trace the journey of a new revolutionary&nbsp;from&nbsp;an ordinary young 
  Tamil medical student&nbsp;who became conscious of&nbsp;the experience of her 
  community and the meaning of her ethnic identity, to a tireless human rights 
  activist who paid the ultimate price for what she believed in. She had no hesitations. 
  This is the story of a new kind of revolutionary. It also tries to unearth her 
  political contribution, as it has&nbsp;as much significance to the current situation 
  as it did 25 years ago. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p style='line-height:13.5pt'><span class=SpellE><span style='font-size:9.5pt;
font-family:&quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:black'>Rajani</span></span><span
style='font-size:9.5pt;font-family:"Verdana","sans-serif";color:black'> began 
  her political life through the Student Christian Movement (SCM) which was very 
  active among the students in the mid-1970s and beyond and got involved in the 
  political issues of the day. As those issues needed&nbsp;to be analysed within 
  a wider socio-economic context, at times other political groups had offered 
  more space that could not be ignored. <span class=SpellE>Rajani</span> and her 
  other colleagues did not hesitate to use such forums while keeping their links 
  with the SCM. The end of the&nbsp;mid-1970s also marked the end of relative 
  peace in the student movement. At <span class=SpellE>Peradeniya</span> an innocent 
  student, <span class=SpellE>Weerasoorya</span>, was gunned down by the police. 
  This sent the shockwaves through the student movement and the universities were 
  closed down by the authorities. For the first time, schools in Colombo had joined 
  the protest following the <span class=SpellE>Weerasoorya</span> murder. The 
  public were fully behind the student movement. The Colombo Medical Faculty, 
  for the first time in its history, went on a strike against the murder of <span class=SpellE>Weerasoorya</span> 
  by the police. <span class=SpellE>Rajani</span> was at the forefront in organizing 
  the strike at the Medical Faculty. This was the&nbsp;reason I met <span class=SpellE>Rajani</span> 
  in September 1976. Our meeting marked a new chapter in our lives and the decision 
  we would make from now would change not only our lives but also our family forever. 
  We fell in love and got married on 28th August 1977 in the midst of anti-Tamil 
  riots in Colombo. <span class=SpellE>Rajani</span> was still a medical student 
  and I had just begun an academic career in the University. We sometimes called 
  ourselves &#145;the unity of opposites&#146; in relation to our social, cultural 
  and ethnic differences. </span></p>
<p style='line-height:13.5pt'><span style='font-size:9.5pt;font-family:&quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;
color:black'>In <span class=SpellE>Rajani&#146;s</span> journey from an ordinary 
  politically conscious&nbsp;Tamil woman to an extraordinary new revolutionary, 
  her marriage was the first step. <span class=SpellE>Rajani</span> broke her 
  barriers and got married to a Sinhalese man who had spent many years in prison.&nbsp; 
  And my own social profile of being brought up in a poor peasant family in the 
  Sinhalese down south&nbsp;was quite unimpressive to her middle-class community. 
  <span class=SpellE>Rajani&#146;s</span> courage and human understanding in accepting 
  me as I was, bewildered even some of our political friends, whose understanding 
  of inter-ethnic relations in both communities had serious defects at the time, 
  as it does today. They were the sons and daughters of the generation of parents, 
  including my own, that formed and belonged to the 1956 Sinhalese social mobility. 
  As far as our families were concerned, they had to accept the inconvenient truth 
  about our relationship and marriage. <span
class=SpellE>Rajani</span> also accepted the continuation of my political commitment 
  as before.&nbsp;We also came to terms with the fact that our family was not 
  going to be a family that would make both parents available for the children 
  throughout their childhood. Any political involvement in Sri Lanka would be 
  a very dangerous affair just as it is today. These were hard and painful decisions. 
  As far as our family was concerned, ideologically and politically, it departed 
  from the accepted&nbsp;family norms of its existence and <span class=SpellE>Rajani&#146;s</span> 
  contribution was crucial in this transformation. Without <span class=SpellE>Rajani&#146;s</span> 
  deep understanding, unhesitant approval and courage we would not have built 
  a family unit that would withstand the political and survival test of our times. 
  Then the birth of our daughters Narmada (1978) and <span class=SpellE>Sharika</span> 
  (1980) made us wonder at times about the level of our political commitments. 
  This was a very emotive, painful and difficult issue. That was a huge responsibility 
  we had failed to anticipate. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p style='line-height:13.5pt'><span class=SpellE><span style='font-size:9.5pt;
font-family:&quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:black'>Rajani&#146;s</span></span><span
style='font-size:9.5pt;font-family:"Verdana","sans-serif";color:black'> consciousness 
  in its evolution took a dramatic turn when she had to work in <span
class=SpellE>Haldummulla</span>, a predominantly Sinhalese village on the <span
class=SpellE>Balangoda</span> - <span class=SpellE>Haputale</span> Road with a 
  scattered Tamil people of up-country origin. Tamils were the poorest of the 
  poor there. One day <span class=SpellE>Rajani</span> had to inform the mother 
  of a young boy who was a patient in the hospital that her son would be transferred 
  to the <span class=SpellE>Badulla</span> Hospital. That would be the only chance 
  of his survival. The woman begged <span class=SpellE>Rajani</span> not to transfer 
  him simply because if he died in <span class=SpellE>Badulla</span> she would 
  not have the money to bring his body back home. However, he was sent to <span class=SpellE>Badulla</span>, 
  ignoring her plea, and he returned home after a full recovery. <span class=SpellE>Rajani</span> 
  found it extremely difficult to deal with such situations of poverty and the 
  sufferings and how it hampered any possibility of a dignified human existence.&nbsp; 
  It left an un-erasable scar on her conscience. Finally in 1980 we both decided 
  that medical practice was not the best employment in such circumstances and 
  decided to leave for Jaffna. <span class=SpellE>Rajani</span> opted for teaching 
  and joined the Medical Faculty in Jaffna University.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style='line-height:13.5pt'><span style='font-size:9.5pt;font-family:&quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;
color:black'>In 1983 <span class=SpellE>Rajani</span> started campaigning to release 
  her sister <span class=SpellE>Nirmala</span> <span class=SpellE>Rajasingham</span> 
  from jail who had been detained under the PTA.&nbsp; Prior to this, <span
class=SpellE>Rajani</span> had treated&nbsp;injured Tamil militants. <span
class=SpellE>Rajani</span> left for England by the end of 1983 on a Commonwealth 
  scholarship to commence her postgraduate studies. Her initial exposure to militant 
  Tamil Tigers and her campaigning for her sister both had contributed to her 
  joining the LTTE. I visited her in mid-1984 in London&nbsp;and it appeared then 
  that there was no going back on her part. She did not wish to return to Sri 
  Lanka through legal channels. I came back to Sri Lanka and this was tantamount 
  to a farewell as I felt there was a huge wall between us. We decided to part 
  and go on our separate ways. However, <span
class=SpellE>Rajani</span> was too honest, politically straightforward, truthful,&nbsp;fiercely 
  independent and committed to her beliefs for the LTTE to handle. These were 
  the personal qualities of a new&nbsp; kind of revolutionary <span class=SpellE>Rajani</span>&nbsp; 
  came to represent in her personal and political journey, which resulted in the 
  ultimate sacrifice for the right of dissent in the Tamil community. <span class=SpellE>Rajani</span> 
  also possessed certain qualities that made it possible for her to connect with 
  ordinary people. After I left for Sri Lanka, within a couple of months <span
class=SpellE>Rajani</span> had left the Tigers. She returned to Jaffna with her 
  two daughters against the advice of the family and friends in 1986. In April 
  1987 from Jaffna <span class=SpellE>Rajani</span> wrote to me, &quot;I am very 
  worried. It is difficult to live here. Most depressing is the dark valley we 
  are walking through &#150;particularly, Inhumanity everywhere. <span class=SpellE>Amma</span> 
  is scared, she is scared for the children that I would talk out loud or do something&quot;. 
  Against these depressing and gloomy political backgrounds <span
class=SpellE>Rajani</span> fused together her new political outlook which consists 
  of the right to dissent against the rule of the gun and the freedom to organise 
  structures that would ensure democratic freedom with human dignity. One of the 
  major components&nbsp;in her outlook was her feminism&nbsp;- in empowering women 
  and building structures to strengthen the independent voice of the woman. She 
  worked for the formation of <span class=SpellE>Poorani</span> for destitute 
  women. These structures and political ideas ideologically and politically went 
  against the military project of the Tamil Tigers. They were poorly equipped 
  with political ideas and organisations that would be capable of having a mature 
  dialogue with dissenting voices. <span class=SpellE>Rajani&#146;s</span> joint 
  authorship of The Broken Palmyra with others brought these ideas to people&#146;s 
  attention. Her pioneering role with other university academics in forming the 
  University Teachers for Human Rights (UTHR J) marked a milestone in human rights 
  in the Tamil community. This work and these political ideas sent shockwaves 
  through the professed monolithic structure of the Tamil Tigers. The UTHR rightly 
  introduces <span class=SpellE>Rajani</span> as <span class=GramE>a</span> olive 
  wire of the organisation even today in its website. The Tamil Tigers understood 
  the possible political danger from <span class=SpellE>Rajani</span>. The Tigers 
  would not hesitate to stop the live wire of the organisation for good. <span class=SpellE>Rajani&#146;s</span> 
  life and death shows how long, arduous and painful the road to victory is when 
  human dignity and the right to dissent are violated by those who choose to use 
  violence to resolve political issues. </span></p>
<p style='line-height:13.5pt'><span style='font-size:9.5pt;font-family:&quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;
color:black'>It is also necessary to reflect on the validity of <span
class=SpellE>Rajani&#146;s</span> ideas in relation to the current political situation. 
  To use <span class=SpellE>Rajani&#146;s</span> phrase still, we are walking 
  through a dark valley, and inhumanity is everywhere. One of the fundamental 
  issues today is the fear to speak out or the right to dissent. The dark shadow 
  of the ethnic war has not entirely disappeared. Unless the democratic space 
  is expanded with maximum devolution of power to the Tamil community peace will 
  be as elusive as ever.</span></p>
<p style='line-height:13.5pt'><span style='font-size:9.5pt;font-family:&quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;
color:black'>It is possible that in both the Tamil and Sinhalese communities there 
  will be more and more people like <span class=SpellE>Rajani</span>, as the political 
  barriers for which <span class=SpellE>Rajani</span> had to give her life, as 
  a new revolutionary in support of their fundamental democratic right of dissent, 
  are still not removed. Those who follow <span class=SpellE>Rajani&#146;s</span> 
  path will make our world a better place.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style='line-height:13.5pt'><b><span style='font-size:9.5pt;font-family:&quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;
color:black'>For twenty long years I have been coming to terms with the terrible 
  pain and anguish <span class=SpellE>Rajani</span> would have felt a few seconds 
  before her death and my inability to share that with her. I know how she would 
  have felt. Once she wrote to me saying that, &quot;If anyone knows me in this 
  world like pages of a book it is you.&quot; I owe so much to her, for the depth 
  of my love for her, and for the true understanding of the beauty of human love 
  that our relationship taught me.&nbsp;</span></b><span

<p style='line-height:13.5pt'><span class=SpellE><span style='font-size:9.5pt;
font-family:&quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:black'>Rajani</span></span><span
style='font-size:9.5pt;font-family:"Verdana","sans-serif";color:black'> and I 
  loved Bob Marley&#146;s music. She particularly liked one song with which I 
  would like to end by quoting &quot;Get up stand up, Stand up for your rights&quot;.
