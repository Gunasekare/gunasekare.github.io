<p align=center style='text-align:center'><b><i><span
style='font-size:18.0pt;'>During the Ceasefire </span></i></b></p>
<h2><b><span style='font-size:16.0pt;font-family:
AvantGarde;text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>Introduction</span></b></h2>
<p style='text-align:justify'>We welcome the ceasefire commencing 25.12.2001 between 
  the Sri Lankan Government and the LTTE, in order to bring an end to the war 
  caused by the ethnic problem in Sri Lanka. </p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Batang;
'>People of all ethnic communities are yearning that both parties should continue 
  to extend this ceasefire and hold talks in a responsible manner and with mutual 
  understanding in order to bring a lasting solution to the ethnic problem.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Batang;
'>But the LTTE which declared that it was going to cease hostilities from the 
  midnight of 24<sup>th</sup> December 2001, has committed over 20 human rights 
  violations since the date of its declaration. These violations include murders, 
  abductions, extortions and attacks. But to date, nobody has either expressed 
  concern or criticised the LTTE.</span></p>
<h2><b><span style='font-size:16.0pt;font-family:
AvantGarde;text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>Current Violations by the 
  LTTE</span></b></h2>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Batang;
'>In the Batticaloa District, the LTTE has rounded up certain villages and has 
  forcibly taken away a number of children for arms training. The LTTE has also 
  burnt over 30 houses in the uncleared areas that were vacated by Tamil families 
  who fled in order to safeguard their young children from being taken away by 
  the LTTE. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'>The LTTE has even taken letters of consent from 
  parents to the effect that they would hand over their children who are now below 
  eight years, when they reach the age for arms training. </p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Batang;
'>In the Jaffna District, the LTTE has started imposing taxes on all commodities. 
  Because of this taxation, the prices of all essential items have increased by 
  at least 15% in Jaffna.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Batang;
'>All these incidents show that despite the ceasefire, the LTTE is threatening 
  normality and the lives of the ordinary people living in the North and East.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span></span><b><span style='font-size:16.0pt;font-family:
AvantGarde;text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>Previous Ceasefires</span></b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'>When we look back at our past experiences, the Tamil 
  and Muslim people and those who are democratic-minded have welcomed the prospects 
  of ceasefires and peace talks. At the same time, they have been anxious about 
  the terrible experiences that have taken place during those ceasefires and immediately 
  following their breakdown. </p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Batang;
'>In particular, it is undeniable that the LTTE has made use of the situations 
  resulting from ceasefires to intimidate, imprison and kill those who dissent 
  from the LTTE or disagree with its political views. </span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>The reason for such killings is that the ceasefires declared 
  so far have been viewed as those between the armed forces and the LTTE. They 
  have not affected the behaviour of the armed forces towards the Tamil and Muslim 
  people in the Northeast, or the behaviour of the LTTE towards the Tamil and 
  Muslim people living in the Northeast. None of the previous ceasefires have 
  included any clause to safeguard the democratic rights of the ordinary Tamil 
  and Muslim people living in the Northeast and the rights of those who do not 
  wish to live under the rule o the LTTE. </p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-family:Batang;'>It is due to this reason 
  that the LTTE was able to make use of this period to kill ordinary Tamils and 
  Muslims, or violate their human rights without any hindrance. The Governments, 
  which agreed to ceasefires with LTTE in the past, not only ignored these killings 
  and other violations by the LTTE, but also did nothing to protect these people 
  from the threat of the LTTE, nor take any action to inquire into those killings 
  and punish those who have committed them.</span></p>
<h2><b><span style='font-size:16.0pt;font-family:
AvantGarde;text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>Past Experiences</span></b></h2>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Batang;
'>On 21<sup>st</sup> September 1989 Dr. Rajani Thiranagama was killed in Jaffna. 
  </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'>During the ceasefire period between the Sri Lankan 
  Government and the LTTE from 1989 to June 1990, the LTTE had killed hundreds 
  of Tamils in the Eastern Province for their connections with the non-LTTE groups 
  and also those whom they considered as their opponents. Independent Human 
  Rights groups have documented details of those killed.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Batang;
'>When the IPKF started withdrawing from the North and East, the LTTE went in 
  to those areas and arrested hundreds of Tamils whom they thought, had acted 
  against them. These incidents had taken place in Amparai, Batticaloa, Trincomalee, 
  Vavuniya Mullaitivu, Mannar, Killinochchi and Jaffna Districts.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Batang;
'>LTTE even checked the trains and other modes of transport, which came from Jaffna, 
  Batticaloa and Trincomalee and abducted those Tamils on whom they had suspicion. 
  Their whereabouts are not known to date. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Batang;
'>Even in Colombo, with the help of the Government Forces, the LTTE arrested those 
  whom they thought were their opponents, took them away, chained in state-owned 
  and privately-owned buses plying between Colombo and Jaffna, and forced them 
  out of the buses at Omantai and Murikandy in the Vanni. The fate that befell 
  them is not known even to date.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'>And it was during a ceasefire, that the LTTE killed 
  TULF leaders A.Amirthalingam and V.Yogeswaran, and seriously injured M.Sivasithamparam. 
  They also killed Member of Parliament Sam Tambimuttu and his wife, outside 
  the Canadian High Commission in Colombo.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Batang;
'>Minister Gamini Dissanayake was killed during the period of exchange of letters 
  relating to a ceasefire with the Government.</span></p>
<h2><b><span style='font-size:16.0pt;font-family:
AvantGarde;text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'> &nbsp; </span></b><b><span style='font-size:16.0pt;font-family:
AvantGarde;text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>&nbsp; </span></b></h2>
<h2><b><span style='font-size:16.0pt;font-family:
AvantGarde;text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>Our Demands</span></b></h2>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Batang;
'>The NGOs and the INGOs who have been committed to peace in Sri Lanka and have 
  worked to promote democracy and human rights in the country must pay particular 
  attention to the violations of human rights that continue to take place during 
  ceasefires. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Batang;
'>While we agree that all necessary steps should be taken to continue this ceasefire 
  between the Government and the LTTE, we request the government of Sri Lanka 
  and those countries which are paying attention to the ceasefire and political 
  developments in Sri Lanka to ensure that the LTTE does not violate the human 
  rights of the ordinary Tamils and Muslims and those who express views not to 
  the liking of the LTTE.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><b><span></span></b><span style='font-family:Batang;
'>We urge the Government of Norway that has been engaged in facilitating the talks 
  to pay particular attention to this matter and take necessary action.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Batang;
'>We call upon the Government of India, which has always shown a genuine interest 
  and concern for the Tamil speaking people of Sri Lanka, to guide and encourage 
  the Governments of Norway and Sri Lanka in this regard.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Batang;
'>The Governments of the USA, UK, Canada and Australia which had banned the LTTE 
  in their own countries and are pushing for the success of the talks between 
  the Government and the LTTE, should maintain their pressure on the LTTE not 
  to violate the rights of the other Tamils and Muslims.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Batang;
'>We call upon all the democratically elected Members of the Parliament of Sri 
  Lanka to take up as their duty the protection of the democratic forces within 
  the Tamil and Muslim community and pressure the government to act appropriately 
  in this regard.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'>Because representatives elected by the Tamil and 
  Muslim people have often been killed in the past, we ask all Members of Parliament 
  to pay attention to this concern. In particular, we draw attention to the constant 
  threat to their lives faced by the fifteen members of the Tamil National Alliance 
  and other Tamil and Muslim Members of Parliament from the Northeast.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span></span><span style='font-family:Batang;
'>As the government and the Tigers are taking preparatory steps to workout a long-term 
  ceasefire agreement and begin peace talks we would stress that particular attention 
  be paid to the above concerns. </span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>The right to life, and other fundamental rights and freedoms 
  are inherent in all human beings. These rights cannot be taken away by governments 
  or any groups to fulfill their own agendas. </p>
