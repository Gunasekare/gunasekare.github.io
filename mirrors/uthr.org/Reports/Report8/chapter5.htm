    The mood of total war:</h3>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:1.5in;mso-margin-top-alt:auto;
mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;margin-left:1.5in'>&nbsp;&nbsp; As in all wars, the 
    sensational siege at Elephant Pass, the suicide assaults, the sea landing, 
    the relief column hopping from one Dutch fort to the next in imitation of 
    the thinking of Dutch strategists three centuries ago when air power was not 
    dreamed of, the victory of one side or of both; this was the fare dished out 
    by the media and eagerly swallowed by the public. Recriminations of one section 
    of the forces against the other, a hasty news conference summoned by the Air 
    Vice Marshal to counter allegations, unaccustomed questions raised about the 
    tardiness of the political establishment in putting forward a political solution, 
    all suggested that the Colombo establishment was shaken. We will not know 
    for some time what questions were raised within the ranks of the LTTE, which 
    it is reported lost 65 women of its cadre on the&nbsp; first day alone. In 
    an Eastern town where business was generally down, a Muslim news agent said 
    that there was a tremendous increase in newspaper sales. Easterners were generally 
    eager for developments in the North in a manner not even slenderly reciprocated 
    by the Northerners. It would thus be true to say that every community felt 
    that something momentous and perhaps decisive was happening at Elephant Pass.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; We draw attention here to a battle that has been fought behind 
    the scenes for months, which has not been written about and whose effects 
    are much more far reaching. Now that the dust has settled for the present 
    on Elephant Pass, those who wish this country and the Tamils well must look 
    more closely at these pernicious developments. It is true that the LTTE banked 
    much on Elephant Pass. Jaffna had been literally plastered with notices saying 

    that Elephant Pass was the `last army camp on the soil of Tamil Eelam', that 
    it was some kind of a final battle, and calling for the whole-hearted support 
    of the people. All indications coming from Jaffna suggest that the LTTE's 
    real motive was to secure the surrender of the camp with hundreds of its men 
    and equipment, and use it as propaganda&nbsp; as well as a bargaining chip. 
    The planning for this had gone on for more than 3 months. There was a concerted 
    attempt to place Jaffna on the footing of total mobilisation. Main roads were 
    blocked to expedite the movement of reinforcements and casualties. Schools 
    were closed to receive the injured. People were called upon to volunteer material 
    and blood. When it became clear that the operation was in a stalemate, people 
    were woken up with loud speaker cries in the night, &quot;Awake, O Tamil people. 
    Do you sleep while your young warriors are dying?&quot; Then grew the fear 
    that having secured Elephant Pass, the army would march into Jaffna.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; According to observers, there was a widespread mood among the 
    people that it would be worthwhile to go forward and resist&nbsp; the army 
    with bare hands. These were the same people who a year ago were skeptical 
    and angry with the LTTE for having started the war. It is therefore necessary 
    to look behind the news and understand the new dangers and their consequences.

  <h3 style='margin-right:1.5in;margin-left:1.5in'><a name=c>5.1.2&nbsp; </a>The 
    South: The mood of July 1983:</h3>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:1.5in;mso-margin-top-alt:auto;
mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;margin-left:1.5in'>&nbsp;&nbsp; The desire of a large 
    number of Tamils to flee Jaffna together with thae&nbsp; fact that a large 
    number of those who joined the exodus are living around Colombo, all the way 
    between Negombo and Panadura, was a major victory for the government, which 
    to some extent diminished the stigma of July 1983. The LTTE found itself imposing 
    an embarrassing pass system. The JOC bomb explosion and the prospect of an 
    army defeat at Elephant Pass, brought back old fears among Tamils. A large 
    number of Tamils were taken in for questioning by the police in Colombo from 
    their homes and from check points, and were abused in harshly communal terms. 
    A young political refugee from the LTTE retorted angrily after his release, 
    &quot;Only Prabhakaran is right for these people!&quot; A remark from a trishaw 
    driver was typical of the mood among the sections that went on the rampage 
    in July 1983: &quot;When we watch the news, we get angry and want to teach 
    a lesson. But the `Boss' has not ordered us to do anything.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; If the Elephant Pass had fallen as it nearly did, and strained 
    nerves in the South had snapped, the disaster of a repetition of July 1983 
    could easily have compounded a defeat in the North. Then the unity of the 
    country for all practical purposes would have been severed, and to talk of 
    soldiers giving their lives to preserve unity would have been an insult. This 
    is why we have argued that there must be a free open discussion of the blunders 
    of the past, including those of this government, to exorcise once and for 
    all missing the legacy of Sinhalese chauvinism. If not and the cause of a 
    united Sri Lanka is lost. <a href="#Top"><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:

    </a>The use of bombing and shelling:</h3>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:1.5in;mso-margin-top-alt:auto;
mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;margin-left:1.5in'>&nbsp;&nbsp; We&nbsp; welcomed the 
    halt called to aerial bombing in March as an enlightened step. But there has 
    since been shelling from time to time and aerial bombing has some times been 
    resorted to On 14th May Daniel Sutharshan Samuel (15), a grandson of Leslie 
    Samuel, who taught many members of the Colombo elite at Royal and St.Thomas', 
    was killed at his home when the army shelled Vaddukoddai from Pallay. Also 
    killed was the two year old son of a teacher at Jaffna College. The army had 
    shelled Vaddukoddai and Chavakachcheri, apparently in order to disrupt the 
    LTTE's plans for holding public meetings. During the Elephant Pass campaign 
    shells fired from Elephant Pass killed up to&nbsp; 6 persons in Chavakacheri, 
    including Ranjit Kumar, Assistant Lecturer in Political Science at the University 
    of Jaffna, who was to go to Britain shortly on study leave. His body was found 
    severed at his home by his students, with his liver some distance away. His 
    sisters had also recently lost their father. In all fewer than 15 civilians 
    were reported killed by bombing and shelling in the Jaffna and Killinochchi 
    areas, during the Elephant Pass campaign.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; We have dwelt repeatedly on the political consequences, apart 
    from&nbsp; the human tragedy, of such actions, and have condemned both the 
    use of, and the philosophy behind them. If in the event of a lack of political 
    initiative, the situation continues to deteriorate, bringing the spectre of 
    total war ever nearer, the army would find good military reasons for the use 
    of widespread bombing and shelling on the grounds of disrupting the LTTE's 
    attempts to mobilise the civilian population. Then total war would become 
    a reality.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; It must also be mentioned that the Airforce showed commendable 
    restraint during the Elephant Pass operation where civilians were concerned. 
    On two occasions there was random shelling in the Karaveddy and Chavakacheri 
    areas. But when people of the area concerned made complaints to the government 
    through the Government Agent&nbsp; and the ICRC in Jaffna, the ejection of 
    missiles was largely stopped. This suggests that the political establishment 
    retained some initiative and wanted at least to minimise the use of missiles. 
    It is thus important to take steps to guard against a situation where nerves 
    snap and there is a plunge into total war, where political initiative is cast 
    aside regardless of the resulting discredit. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; The government has consistently condemned all acts of the LTTE 
    resulting in civilian deaths as terrorist acts. The attack on the JOC, a military 
    target, which also resulted in many civilians dying, was indeed termed such. 
    In this instance again the government was guilty of double standards. For 
    it had condoned and justified aerial and artillery attacks on supposedly LTTE 
    targets which resulted overwhelmingly in civilian deaths. <a href="#Top"><span

  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:1.5in;mso-margin-top-alt:auto;
mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;margin-left:1.5in'>&nbsp;&nbsp; The fact that these 
    continue to occur because of the activities of the security forces has enabled 
    the LTTE to mobilise the&nbsp; population towards total war while justifying 
    such repression as would have seemed an Orwellian fantasy ten years ago. About 
    March, when aerial bombing was stopped, there was a tendency among the people 
    to feel that the Sri Lankan forces had learnt from the past. This was also 
    spurred by reports of disappearances in the East and of bodies in sacks floating 
    in the Batticaloa lagoon.&nbsp; These reports were highlighted in the LTTE 
    controlled media. With the news of the Kokkadichoalai massacre in June, the 
    tide decisively turned. This was an important part of the background to the 
    mood of the people during the Elephant Pass siege. <a href="#Top"><span

    </a>The war against historical memory:</h3>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:1.5in;mso-margin-top-alt:auto;
mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;margin-left:1.5in'>&nbsp;&nbsp; Every oppressive political 
    tendency needs to erase historical memory and substitute its own mytho-history. 
    Everything that is a big lie must shrink and shrivel before even a tiny beam 
    of the light of truth. The LTTE understood this well. The extent of repression 
    to which it could allow itself to go depended much on the visible threat posed 
    to the Tamil people as a whole. During the period of good relations with the 
    government, in early 1990, its oppressive methods were running into trouble. 
    Even after the war had begun, its new wave of repression coincided with news 
    of large scale massacres and disappearances in the East, and began about early 
    September 1990.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of their current passivity and resignation, it set 
    about arresting those with remote past militant connections - particularly 
    those small but politically articulate groups - the others having fled or 
    having already faced death or imprisonment. Those in Jaffna from these groups, 
    which had long been defunct,&nbsp; had quietly become inactive without ever 
    challenging the LTTE. The LTTE's&nbsp; moves against these persons appeared 
    to be mere paranoia at that time. But the situation has become clearer now. 
    These persons were living monuments to historical memory, an intolerable link 
    with the past, with past ideals of the militant movement and a time when there 
    were many groups fighting the oppression of the Sri Lankan state.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; The war against historical memory has now been organised on a 
    systematic and thorough footing. The most recent purge of May-June was aimed 
    at the Theepori (Sparks) group. This group had split from the PLOTE in early 
    1985 protesting against its internal repression, and the most remarkable thing 
    they did was to document their experiences inside the PLOTE in a book with 
    the title `A new&nbsp; kind of world'. They remained totally passive and their 

    book was and continues to be widely circulated by the LTTE. Three of its members 
    recently detained were students of the University of Jaffna. [See 5.2 for 
    report].<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; Within the University of Jaffna itself the 1st and 2nd years 
    are isolated from 3rd and 4th years and are handled differently. They are 
    addressed, admonished and warned in separate meetings. The 3rd and 4th years 
    are a link with the history of the university when it was a different place, 
    when discussion was open and the university took positions against oppression, 
    irrespective of whether it came from the LTTE or the IPKF.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; In schools again, the teachers are watched by students taken 
    out, trained and brought back. The LTTE frequently addressed meetings at schools.&nbsp; 
    In addition to the public display of weapons and uniforms, young teenagers 
    are fed with a history which is totally sanitised. There is thus very clear 
    evidence of an attempt to mould a generation without links with the past. 
    As we have seen, several academics and members of the elite have been co-opted 
    in this exercise. Young teenagers are thus pushed into dying for leaders and 
    members of the elite, who as far as they and perhaps their families are concerned, 
    have no intention of dying. <a href="#Top"><span style='text-decoration:

  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:1.5in;mso-margin-top-alt:auto;
mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;margin-left:1.5in'>&nbsp;&nbsp; With all the allures 
    of falsehood and deceit, children are children. That such large numbers are 
    mobilised into a fighting force seems remarkable to many. Many of them remain 
    in the movement with grave doubts and die with them. We shall take one aspect 
    in breaking them, presented on the basis of testimony given by teenagers who 
    succeeded in leaving the movement.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; After a couple of days inside, the initial allure had gone, life 
    inside was oppressive and many of them wanted to leave. One of the children 
    told the man in charge that he wanted to go home. Immediately, everyone was 
    called together and he who wanted to go home was given a sound public thrashing. 
    The others who also wanted to go then kept quiet. Their parents who succeeded 

    in tracing them came to the camp and asked for their children. Each child 
    was faced with his parents and asked if he wished to go home. The answer was 
    consistently `no'.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; In due course a few were given drugs that made them feel violent. 
    They were given the freedom to let loose by torturing prisoners.... and so 
    it went. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; Another revealing instance is that of a young girl from Karaveddy 
    who joined the LTTE. Her father had been a toddy tapper who had died when 
    he fell from a palmyrah tree. Her mother was desperate. During the Jaffna 
    Fort operation last year, the mother received a letter smuggled out of a camp 
    by a labourer. The letter from her daughter said that she was in the Nelliady 
    girls' camp and desperately wanted to go home. She added that four girls from 
    the camp had been taken to Jaffna Fort and had not come back, making her very 
    much afraid.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; The mother went to the camp with a friend to plead her case. 
    The leader of the camp repeatedly denied the girl's presence. In desperation, 
    the mother produced her daughter's letter. The leader read the letter, called 
    out the girl, and in her mother's presence slapped her and kicked her with 
    her boot. She then sent the mother away telling her that her daughter will 
    never be released.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; Those who normally succeed in getting their children out are 
    members of the elite. It is a reflection of Tamil politics today that a force 
    which cynically treats those at the bottom of the social ladder in this manner 
    is projected as a revolutionary force. Some western academics even appear 
    to credit it as standing for caste liberation. <a href="#Top"><span

  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:1.5in;mso-margin-top-alt:auto;
mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;margin-left:1.5in'>&nbsp;&nbsp; One aspect of mobilisation 
    of civilians is propaganda and a genuine fear of the Sri Lankan army. Those 
    whose children get killed in the LTTE's cause are at first angry. Subsequently 
    their child is praised as a martyr and the parents are made to feel that they 
    had done an invaluable service in sacrificing a child.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; In many areas economic life is at a stand-still because of a 
    situation created jointly by the LTTE and the government for different reasons. 
    In some areas people have had little choice, but to sell their labour to the 
    LTTE in return for daily wages. In the Vanni region much damage to economic 
    life has resulted from the `guerrilla operations' of the Sri Lankan army - 
    Advance, Loot, and Return to Base. Here, a special propaganda appeal is being 
    made by the LTTE to the people by promoting their legendary hero, Pandara 
    Vanniyan, as the forerunner and prototype of Prabakaran. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; In some areas, government rations to displaced persons have been 
    used as a means of securing forced labour. Here the Grama Sevaka has to complete 
    two sets of forms, one for the government and the other for the LTTE. The 
    LTTE has to certify a day's labour by a member of the family before the week's 
    ration's could be released.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; The two sovereigns of gold tax per family in Jaffna is now being 
    vigorously pursued. In some cases people had been imprisoned until the money 
    was found. In one school near Thinnevely, about May, ten girls were picked 
    up after school, several of them daughters of out-of-work farmers. They were 
    released after the sovereigns were paid - often after borrowing from several 
    friends and relatives. <a href="#Top"><span style='text-decoration:none;

    </a>In conclusion:</h3>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:1.5in;mso-margin-top-alt:auto;
margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:1.5in'>&nbsp;&nbsp; The LTTE, it could be said, 
    has tried nearly every means in the handbook of repression short of physical 
    conscription. Its uneasy edifice cannot hold together or derive whatever legitimacy, 
    without the fear of, and oppression coming from the politics of the Sri Lankan 
    state. The people of course resent both and would like to protest. But every 
    little space has been smothered by intertwined events. Every turn of the LTTE's 
    screw of repression received its licence from, and is traceable to repressive 
    actions and massacres by the state. The invisible spiral of events has thus 
    been moving towards total war. As we have shown in this and the&nbsp; previous 
    volumes, total war and not peace is the logical culmination of the LTTE'S 
    politics and its only hope of survival. Yogi had said on May Day of 1987, 
    that civilians dying is a small matter. A small fraction of its population 
    then, he said, was enough to people the new world of Tamil Eelam.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; It is left to those who mean well to understand this politics 
    as not just abominable, but also fragile, thriving merely on the weakness, 
    wickedness and stupidity of others. Total war is an unmitigable tragedy that 
    must be averted. <a href="#Top"><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:

    in the University of Jaffna:</h3>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:1.5in;mso-margin-top-alt:auto;
mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;margin-left:1.5in'>&nbsp;&nbsp; Dominic (Nobert) was 
    a leading member of the `Theepori' (Sparks) group described in the last section. 
    Following the repression that began in September last year, Dominic fled Jaffna 
    in October. He returned to Jaffna in May in order to make arrangements for 
    the safety of some members who were associated with them and were stuck in 
    Jaffna. The news that he was staying in a house in Kokkuvil was leaked to 
    the LTTE by an informer in the neighbourhood. He was soon picked up by the 
    LTTE. This was quickly followed by the arrests of another 3 members of this 
    group from the university.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; The arrests of these students took place about two days after 
    the arrest of Nobert. On 22nd May Sellathurai Srinivasan (2nd year Geography 
    Special) of Potpathy Road, Kokkuvil, and Nagalingam Govindarajan (3rd year 
    Commerce), of Varani, were arrested. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; Srinivasan was from a family of 7 boys and 2 girls. Two brothers 
    had been in the PLOTE and later among the Theepori dissidents in 1985. Nobert 
    is said to have hidden in Srinivasan's sisters house at the time of his arrest.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; Another student Thirukethees (1st year Arts) was arrested at 
    the university a few days later, by LTTE cadre accompanied by MMK students, 
    the MMK being a one time cultural organisation and now effectively&nbsp; the 
    policing arm of the LTTE within the university. Thirukethees had wanted to 
    see the Vice Chancellor. He was told, in response, &quot;There is no need. 
    If he knows the LTTE took you, he will understand&quot;. This was later represented 
    by the LTTE as Thirukethes running into the university to hide.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; A few days later Editor Ravi, an LTTE functionary addressed the 
    junior students in isolation. The students had been demanding to see their 
    detained colleagues. Editor gave the charges against those detained. Srinivasan, 
    besides his associations, is accused of planning to help in running a dissident 
    paper for the Theepori. The charge against Govindarajan was more ironic. He 
    is said to have in 1985 hidden a Theepori dissident hunted by the PLOTE! Thirukethees 
    had the vague charge of supplying information. Editor then went into a harangue 
    calling those detained not just traitors to the LTTE, but also to the student 
    body. Having worked himself upto a climax, Editor asked the students what 
    punishment should be given to the detainees. A silence followed. A lone voice 
    then suggested meekly &quot;Pardon them&quot;, turning what should have been 
    a gory climax into an anti-climax.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; Editor went into a rage. &quot;That word is not in our dictionary&quot;, 
    he said. He then warned them not to be funny because they are university students, 
    adding that they have a large number of detainees and do not care whether 
    someone is from the university or not. The students were also told that the 
    LTTE was not concerned with 3rd and 4th years as they were going out, but 
    that the others had better look sharp. An MMK student duly rose and gave Editor 
    the vote of thanks, expressing the students' gratitude for his profound discourse. 
    We have already observed that this is part of the effort to break with tradition, 
    obiliterate history and mould a new generation within narrow mental confines.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; About a month later, the LTTE radio announced that a student 
    union meeting would take place at Kailasapathy Auditorium the following morning, 
    24th June.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; The students were surprised to find a senior academic and&nbsp; 
    former senior student counsellor going up the stage to address them. In addressing 
    the students, he told them, &quot;There are still weeds left in the university. 
    They will not be tolerated. These weeds must be plucked up and cast away...&quot; 
    The students were shell-shocked, and afraid.&nbsp; The former senior student 
    counsellor went on to call the detainees traitors, despite earlier having 
    said that inquiries had not been concluded. He also listed Muslims among the 
    traitors.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; Following the meeting, the students found that all exits from 
    the university had been shut. The students were herded out through the main 
    entrance, were handed prepared slogans, and were importuned to participate 
    in a demonstration protesting the arrest of a student Jayaseelan in Batticaloa 
    by the army and the massacres in the East. To bar escape, the demonstration 
    was escorted on its flanks by the MMK. After the demonstration had commenced 
    there was suddenly a change of slogan. The cry, &quot;Release all students 
    detained&quot;, was heard coming from the middle section. The `police' rushed 
    to the centre of the commotion and an argument ensued, mainly with 1st years.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; The senior academic addressing a student meeting not called by 
    the union, and in such intimidating terms, is something totally unprecedented 
    in the history of the University of Jaffna. Such persons would at other times 
    remark that should the army come into Jaffna, they would all become `born 
    again Sri Lankans'. Nor do they act under compulsion. There are humble school 
    heads who have refused to receive the LTTE's leading personage Anton Balasingham 
    during his routine `Pied Piper' missions to schools.&nbsp; The LTTE knows 
    the limits to which it can push individuals. Sycophancy&nbsp; has long been 
    a respectable academic tradition in this country. By comparison the decency 
    and courage of a number of ordinary, vulnerable, students in an atmosphere 
    of terror, is remarkable.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; We had observed that the Theepori group had existed passively, 
    at best as a literary circle. While telling the public that they&nbsp; were 
    traitors, the LTTE circulated copies of their `A new kind of world', found 
    where Dominic was staying. More ironically, the same book describing the repressive 
    atmosphere within the PLOTE, is now being serialised in an LTTE journal published 
    in Canada. Those authors now in LTTE hands, may be undergoing much of what 
    they had described in their own book, as a prophetic warning about the direction 
    of the militancy in general.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; We observe that the backdrop to the singular event in the university 
    on 24th June was the situation in the East, culminating in the Kokkadichcholai 
    massacre. At present the students are mostly cynical, are waiting to get out, 
    and will only raise issues in a cursory manner that is not sustained. With 
    the socially conscientious students suppressed and without the ability&nbsp; 
    to organise around issues, it is the frivolous element that gains publicity, 
    and this&nbsp; in turn&nbsp; is used by the Tigers to isolate the university. 
    The situation contrasts sharply with times when there was a great deal of 
    free discussion. In May 1977, the university Science Students Union even sent 
    a team to investigate the plight of hill-country Tamil workers from Delta 
    North Estate, Pusselewa, who had been subjected to a grievous communally motivated 
    attack, and a balanced, mature report was published and distributed. The student 
    body then was conscious of playing a role in nation-building, embracing the 
    wider Tamil speaking community. Today all that has been dashed to pieces. 
    The handful of students at present who are seen to have character and have 
    personally refused to compromise with untruth are closely watched by the MMK. 
    The students detained had previously received several visits from the MMK.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; During the recent Elephant Pass campaign, the LTTE's propaganda 
    chief, Yogi, observed angrily in a public speech, that young persons in their 
    early teens were dying on the battle field, while those in their twenties 
    were donating blood. He said that it should have been the other way round. 
    Why this reversal of roles over the last five years before when it was those 
    of a mature age who died fighting, is a question that Yogi dare not ask. <span

    Kovilady, Jaffna, was among the brightest students at Jaffna Central College, 
    having scored 8 distinctions at his O.L's. Both his parents were in Germany. 
    Shortly after the outbreak of war in June 1990, he went to Colombo with the 
    intention of joining his parents. He was refused his visa as the German embassy 
    found an apparent hitch in his papers. His father sent a message asking him 
    to get back to Jaffna and follow his A.L's. He went back to staying with his 
    aunt in Jaffna and was unhappy, thus losing interest in studies. This is when 
    he decided to join the LTTE.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; Having joined, he told friends whom he met, &quot;I would like 
    to leave. But a gun is ever before me.&quot; In March this year he went as 
    group leader in one of the many units sent to attack the army camp at Silavathurai 
    in the Mannar sector. He was asked to advance against the camp. According 
    to accounts coming from survivors, he protested that it would be suicidal 
    to advance by daylight towards a camp sited in open land. He was reprimanded 
    and ordered to proceed. He was an early victim of the army's shelling. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; Senthooran's death did not at first receive official publicity. 
    His friends were the first to print and circulate condolence notices privately. 
    It was then that the LTTE appeared to take notice.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; His picture then went up on posters and in speeches he was commemorated 
    a worthy martyr for a cause close to his heart, and an example to others. 
    So rests another in the arms of eternity - a small atom of a big lie. <a

    Fort : The Propaganda and the Message:</h3>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:1.5in;mso-margin-top-alt:auto;
mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;margin-left:1.5in'>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thileepan gave the 
    Dutch Fort in Jaffna momentous significance just before commencing his fast 
    to death in 1987. He called it a symbol of oppression of the Tamil Nation. 
    Thus early in the war, the LTTE banked much on capturing the Fort. The Sri 
    Lankan army withdrew from the Fort in September last year. The LTTE then commenced 
    the demolition of this archaeological treasure turned symbol of oppression. 
    About the first to go after the LTTE takeover was the large church, one of 
    the finest pieces of Dutch architecture in this country, handed over by the 
    government to the Jaffna Christian Union in the 60s.&nbsp; The walls of the 
    fort are now in the process of demolition.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; The `Muththamil Vila' organised by the LTTE during the middle 
    of the year to commemorate Tamil culture was one of those occasions when streams 
    of visitors were allowed into what remains of the Fort.<br>

    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; One of those things that survives intact is the Fort prison, 
    not lacking in inmates. Additional housing for prisoners took the form of 
    several&nbsp; tin huts with slits about a foot above the ground, and circular 
    holes with tubes above the slits, for prisoners to pass urine. Persons inside 
    were trying to attract the attention of the visitors, who had accidentally 
    strayed from the visitors' area. An LTTE man came rushing and shooed them 
    away. He then banged the tin hut to stop the prisoners from calling out. Each 
    hut was estimated to contain up to 20 persons.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; An LTTE boy casually explained later that the prisoners were 
    LTTE cadre who wanted to leave the organisation and had given notice. Their 
    punishment was to spend a year on one meal a day demolishing the Fort stone 
    by stone. They are allowed visitors once a month. After a year, they could 
    leave. A prisoner told a visitor, &quot;This thing is so torturous that it 
    would have been easier to join the Black Tiger suicide unit&quot;. If this 
    is the condition of&nbsp; prisoners who are LTTE members, the conditions under 
    which other prisoners live are left to conjecture.<br>

    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; It looks as though the treasured parts of the Fort would go. 
    But the prison quarters may remain. Is that the symbolism of liberation? <a

  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:1.5in;mso-margin-top-alt:auto;

    (30) father of two, and Paramasamy Uthayasooriyam (28) were standing in the 
    queue at the Vavuniya army check point. Both were traders from Kayts transporting 
    goods from Colombo to Jaffna. They had much money in bank drafts and in cash. 
    They were directed to the PLOTE Office by the army to get a permit. Subsequently 
    several witnesses saw them being taken by the army. Since then they are missing. 
    Their relatives made inquiries at all the army camps in the area and were 
    told that since they are not with the army they must be with the PLOTE. The 
    ICRC was also informed.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; Representations were made to Tharmalingam Sitharthan in Colombo, 
    leader of the DPLF, the political wing of the PLOTE. On one occasion while 
    a relative was speaking to Sitharthan by telephone a friend of the relative's 
    was in the PLOTE office. With Sitharthan was a key military leader of the 
    PLOTE, who appeared to be very angry with traders. While Sitharthan was answering 
    questions on the telephone very politely, the military leader was telling 
    him angrily, &quot;Tell them they have to pay five lakhs of rupees to see 
    a person, and 25 lakhs for their release. These lorry fellows must be taught 
    a lesson. When we ask them to bring jeans and shirts from Colombo, they ignore 
    us. But they give the LTTE what they ask.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; Nothing else so far been heard of the prisoners. Though they 
    were taken by the army, people generally blamed the PLOTE. It shows that these 
    Tamil groups are working with (for?) the army under conditions where they 
    cannot do anything for the people, and in turn increasingly become angry and 
    alienated. <a

      persons reached about 2500 in July.This list does not include those confirmed 
      dead.The number of dead in the Eastern Province is conservatively put at 
      7000 excluding Trincomalee.<br>
      A Hindu social service organisation, said in July that there were over 400 
      widows from the war among those now staying in the Akkaraipattu Tamil AGA's 
      divisions in the Amparai district.<br>
      The Muslim area of Kattankudy has about 200 widows from the violence, since 
      l987. The Mosque massacre last year left 90 women widowed.<br>
      The number of persons killed fighting for the LTTE at Elepahant pass during 
      July is put by the LTTE at 500 and at varying higher figures by other local 
      sources. A large number of the casualities are young women and children 
      sent in waves of suicidal charges. The children among the injured are the 
      most traumatised, such as the child in Jaffna hospital with his legs blown 
      off, complining of an ache in a finger. Several of the children admitted 
      being forced into charges.<br>
      The propaganda manipulation of the Elephant Pass campaign gave rise to a 
      collective euphoria which even took hold of balanced persons in Jaffna to 
      their surprise. Even children down to the age of l0 were carried off by 
      the surge to join the LTTE in large numbers. With the failure to remove 
      the camp at Elephant Pass, deflation came very fast and there was much private 
      criticism of the LTTE. But for the children who joined, it was too late!</span></b></p>
