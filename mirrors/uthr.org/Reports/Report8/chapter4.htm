  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:1.5in;mso-margin-top-alt:auto;
mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;margin-left:1.5in'>&nbsp;&nbsp; He is middle aged, 
    among the foremost Tamil writers, gentle in mind, softspoken, and highly cultured. 
    Though hailing from Kalmunai, he acquired sturdy roots in Jaffna through long 
    association with its university as well as library circles there. His enthusiasm 
    in working for a more rational political environment and in campaigning against 
    the ideology of Sinhalese chauvinism, was not second to that of any Tamil. 
    He was in so many ways the ideal university don, very thorough, painstaking, 
    articulate and willing to devote much time to the concerns of students. The 
    beneficiaries of his labour were mainly Tamils. Today he is classed as an 
    untouchable, unable to return to Jaffna, because in a new turn of its ideology, 
    Tamil chauvinism turned against a large and important section of the Tamil 
    speaking peoples - the Muslims. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; Recent developments have left him a broken man. In October 1989, 
    when the TNA's rout was beginning,three members of his family in Kalmunai 
    were among those 12 Muslims killed by the TNA in Kalmunai - his brother, sister 
    and brother-in-law. It barely took half a dozen&nbsp; months for the conquerors 
    - the LTTE - to turn against the Muslims collectively. In the East today, 
    Muslims are being hunted by this group wherever they are exposed. Even this 
    criminal indignity has not prevented well heeled Tamil expatriate promoters 
    of this ideology from eloquently addressing international fora about the oppression 
    of the `Tamil speaking people'. What is equally bad, the group styled the 
    `moderate Tamils' who influence the western media and agencies, do not readily 
    acknowledge the serious disabilities and threat to life faced by the Muslims 
    of the North-East.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; Today our university don is a `Scholar Gypsy' with no permanent 
    abode. An old friend meeting him was surprised by his answers to the questions: 
    &quot;Where are you coming form?&quot; - &quot;I don't know&quot;; &quot;Where 
    are you staying?&quot; - &quot;I don't know&quot;. The Southern universities, 
    for their own reasons, have not accommodated him so far. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; Our next interlocutor is a young Muslim intellectual from Eravur. 
    Unlike our scholar gypsy whose state of mind is characterised by resignation 
    and fatalism, in the case of this young man the fiery anger he feels is evident. 
    Yet he has commanded the discipline not to blame the fate of his people collectively 
    on the Tamils. He said, &quot;With all that has befallen me, that I could 
    yet sit and talk about it in this fashion, owes to a peculiar ability which 
    God has given me&quot;. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; He related the tragedy of his family: &quot;My father is a man 
    of moderate means who had his fields in the neighbouring Tamil village. My 
    uncle next door had a shop. The LTTE camp was near my house. My brother had 
    joined the LTTE several years ago. For him it was at that time mainly a thrill. 
    About 100 youths from Eravur had joined the LTTE, many of them when the IPKF 

    was around. My brother had risen to become the youth organiser for the Batticaloa 
    region (SOLT leader). On the surface at least, Eravur was a bastion of the 
    LTTE. But I knew that important political issues relating to the Muslims lay 
    unresolved and were being increasingly bungled. We were not generally sympathetic 
    to the SLMC. I went to the local LTTE office a number of times and spoke to 
    the regional commander, who used to come there. I discovered that he was a 
    fathead where politics was concerned. Nothing would pierce his head.&nbsp; 
    I realised that disaster would come sooner or later. The LTTE in the meantime 
    got everything they wanted from Eravur, whether it was money or food. Two 
    months before the war, in April 1990, the LTTE&nbsp; came to my cousin's house 
    during the Ramazan festival. We gave them food packets for 40 persons. It 
    is also remarkable that after the Kattankudy massacre on 3rd August, Eravur 
    remained calm until they massacred in our village. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I will give you incontrovertible proof that it was the 
    LTTE that was responsible for the massacre in my village on 12th August 1990. 
    There were firing noises and those at home thought that the LTTE and the army 
    were fighting. Everyone gathered at my cousin's house. LTTE men then came 
    to my cousin's and called him by name. He went out thinking they were tired 
    and wanted water. They were the very persons who had come home and collected 
    food packets from us during Ramazan. Those who survived can swear to this, 
    though their names are not known with certainty. The others were then dragged 
    out, including the children. Everyone was asked to face the wall. Realising 
    what was coming my cousin, who was a Tamil poet, went down on his knees and 
    pleaded. When the Tigers opened fire he died on his knees. My father and mother 
    and two elder sisters were among those killed. The second of my elder sisters 
    died shielding my eldest sister's daughter and son. The daughter was killed 
    while the son escaped. All were killed except the boy mentioned, my uncle 
    and my 19 year old younger sister. They fell, injured by riochettring bullets. 
    Among the 13 members of my family killed were 7 children - one of them just 
    4 months and another a year.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;My younger sister later stayed with me in the South and 
    received medical treatment. These beasts took away my father and mother, the 
    very things most precious to me in this world. I can only call them mindless 
    and heartless beasts. They completely extirpated my links with Eravur. I am 
    orphanned in this world. If I am to go to Eravur and ask for food, it will 
    have to be from some distant relative. They killed 30 people in the area where 
    my extended family lived. It was here that the killing was most intense.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;My brother in the LTTE was in Kokkadichcholai when he received 
    news of the massacre, and the deaths at home. He was told that the army had 
    done it. It was 3 days before he discovered the truth. He then escaped and 
    surrendered to the army. He is in Colombo now. Most of the Muslim cadre deserted. 
    Those who surrendered to the army were released. Many just came&nbsp; back 
    to the village without surrendering. Several of them were later picked up 
    by the army on tip-offs and were killed. <br>
    <br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Why did the LTTE&nbsp; do this to my family? I am convinced 
    that they hoped that by killing a family with LTTE connections, the blame 
    would fall on the army. In this they miscalculated and failed. The LTTE's 
    intention is to enslave the Muslims. Eravur has only recently started producing 
    intellectuals.&nbsp; Why do you think the LTTE killed our cluster principal, 
    Dawood? They want to get rid of educated Muslims. There is no prospect of 
    peace between the Muslims and the LTTE.&nbsp; If any Muslim deals with the 
    LTTE, he cannot be a Muslim. Nowhere have Muslims been so insulted. Even the 
    Israeli Mossad has not murdered Muslims worshipping in a Mosque. These beasts 
    have done even that. There is only one solution. The Muslims need a region 
    which they can call their own.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; The foundation for a Muslim politics articulating the slogan 
    that Tamils cannot be trusted has thus been firmly laid. The parallel with 
    the recent history of Tamils in connection with the Sinhalese state is evident, 
    as is the ultimate destructiveness of such politics. The murder in the Mosque 
    among others and the prevalence of such feelings described above, give the 
    lie to the contention of LTTE backers (for example the expatriate journal, 
    `The Tamil Nation') and several peace makers, that the warring parties being 
    deadlocked are now back to square one (ie. June 1990), and hence it is simply 
    a matter of going back to the arrangement prevailing until 10th June 1990. 
    The contention ignores people, their tragedies and consequently, the serious 
    loss of legitimacy the warring parties have to contend with. How will they 
    contend with an airing of the past which any political settlement should allow 
    for?<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; We moreover note some parallels to what Tamils commonly say about 
    Muslims. Each community in the East appears to feel that the other has a conspiracy 
    to eliminate its intellectuals. &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#Top"><span

  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:1.5in;mso-margin-top-alt:auto;
mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;margin-left:1.5in'>&nbsp;&nbsp; About June 1991 some 
    LTTE notices appeared in the East which were seen by a large number of people. 
    These read `Pardon for Kattankudy, Death to Eravur and Inquiry for Oddimavady'. 
    This same slogan having been loosely spoken of in Jaffna some weeks earlier 
    by LTTE cadre, points to its conception at a high level. Others saw it in 
    part as a demand for protection money. It would take an abnormally thick skin 
    to pardon a people after murdering 120 of their close kin in a Mosque.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; This was not the first time that the LTTE used Sri Lankan army 
    methods to bring Muslims to heel. There was a massacre about New Year's day 
    1988, when the LTTE killed over 60 Muslims (Report by Jehan Haniff, Sunday 
    Island, 17th January 1988). This went unnoticed in the heat of the war between 
    the IPKF and the LTTE. The massacre followed the killing of Nazeer, an LTTE 
    man who exercised considerable power in Kattankudy, by ex-home guards on 29.12.87. 
    Several bodies were dumped near the Muslim school. Among those killed were 
    Muslims of Kattankudy orgin returning home after fleeing the fighting in Jaffna. 
    They had plied trades such as vending popsicles.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; Like the Tamils of Colombo and the hill-country who voted for 
    the UNP despite repeated bouts of racial violence, the older Muslims, at least, 
    remained open to making up with the LTTE, although, naturally, their capacity 
    to give guarantees for the young was declining. Even during the LTTE's triumphant 
    return to the East in December 1989 after recruiting heavily among Muslims, 
    there were still a number of small&nbsp; acts of resistance by Muslim youth, 
    while the Tamils who had hundreds of their young killed by the LTTE, received 
    them passively.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; Despite last year's massacres, as late as March this year, many 
    Muslim leaders from Eravur to Akkariapattu were still open to a deal with 
    the LTTE, provided the LTTE publicly vowed to leave Muslims in peace. By July, 
    hopes of that had evaporated. Apart from the massacre in Puddur, the LTTE 
    had since signalled its attitude&nbsp; through several acts. Muslims no longer 
    travel on the road between Kattankudy and Kalmunai after a Muslim driver from 
    Kalmunai transporting the remains of a Tamil for internment in Batticaloa, 
    was abducted.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; During the latter part of April, a van taking passengers from 
    Kattankudy to catch the Colombo bound train at Valaichenai was attacked between 
    Kiran and Kumburumoolai where there was a gap in the army picket. One Ismail 
    was killed and an injured person was admitted to Polonnaruwa hospital. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; About 24th June, two persons from the Muslim colony in Batticaloa 
    went to Kalliankadu, near the bus depot, to give Haj Festival eats to Tamil 
    friends. The two have not been seen after they were abducted.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; There are a number of fishermen living in Kattankudy wards 1 
    and 2. About 16th July, two Muslims fishing in the lagoon were shot dead by 
    firing from the other side, when they dared to go too far from the shore for 
    a better catch. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; Muslim traders from Kattankudy trading in Batticaloa, have to 
    close their shops about 4.30 p.m. when sales pick up, and rush home before 
    the police and army pickets are off.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; Thus the economic life of Muslims is greatly constricted, more 
    particularly in the Batticaloa District. The number of pilgrims to Mecca from 
    Kattankudy has declined to 30 in the last year from 200 in the year preceding. 
    Morever the Muslims are increasingly boxed into small areas where there can 
    be no satisfactory economic life. <br>
    <br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp; An incident that gives the lie to the widespread belief of Muslim 
    prosperity is the fate of the Eravur refugees in Puddur, described in the 
    previous section. They had been hunted in Eravur. When poverty drove then 
    elsewhere, they were hunted there as well. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; Few Tamils acknowledge the difficulties faced by Muslims. The 
    common contention is that they are trading, they are moving about and are 
    doing well. It is also used as proof that the Tamils have been generous - 
    a dangerous similarity to the widespread belief of the Sinhalese that they 
    had been generous to the Tamils. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; But the trauma of a community which daily feels hunted and whose 

    birthright is being denied is daily visible and too dangerous to ignore. A 
    typical scene was Batticaloa station. Muslims feel safest travelling by train 
    when the train leaves from Batticaloa. Muslims, mainly from Kattankudy came 
    to Batticaloa at dawn and joined the queue near the station. There were a 
    large number of women carrying infants. The people are normally allowed in 
    by 8.00 a.m., but on this day there was a delay. The sun climbed. Many of 
    the Tamils were able to go to houses of friends or into neighbouring premises 
    for rest and shelter. But few of the Muslims dared to do this. They clung 
    to such little shade as was afforded by fences on Station Road. About 12.30 
    p.m. it was announced that the train was cancelled.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; Muslims in general despair at the prospect that is widely taken 
    for granted, that in the destructive context of Sri Lankan politics, the only 
    conceivable end to this conflict is for the government and the Tigers to strike 
    a deal along the lines of that which broke down last year. A group of leading 
    Muslims put it thus: &quot;With all its drawbacks we can survive in the present 
    situation, if&nbsp; needs be, on kanji (rice porridge). But if the government 
    and the LTTE start talking, we are finished! Our experience of the LTTE's 
    intentions is that they would either finish us off or chase us away.&quot; 
    Referring to other Tamil groups they said, &quot;Their minds are not pure 
    where the Muslims are concerned..&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time many Muslims are conscious of the fact that 
    they have to live with the Tamils. A senior Muslim in the Amparai District 
    who is politically active put it eloquently: &quot;We have to live with the 
    Tamils. Otherwise we must go elsewhere. Our whole economic life is integrated 
    with that of the Tamils. If we try to live separately, we will be left clinging 
    to the Pallivasal (Mosque) and the thoppi (prayer cap)&quot;. It is therefore 
    imperative that while the opportunity exists, Tamils must make every effort 
    to seek reconciliation with the Muslims. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; Those Tamils who feel bitter about the violence that has come 
    out of the Muslim community should also examine the context and look at the 
    violent resposne of the Tamils themselves, to the bigotted institutional violence 
    of the Sri Lankan state. This response lead to routine massacres of Sinhalese 
    civilians with its degeneration. Lumpen politics breeds a lumpen response, 
    often of a more potent and self-destructive kind. Even so, the extent of militarisation 
    of the Muslim community has been remarkably low. There has also reportedly 
    been talk among the armed forces of the supposedly inadequate support they 
    have received from Muslims. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; Every instance of violence by Muslims in the last ten years has 
    been preceded by robberies, kidnappings, other acts of violence by Tamil groups 
    and very importantly, by attempts on the part of local Muslim leaders to negotiate 
    from a non-aggressive possition. When the Kattankudy Muslims were massacred 
    in Kurukkalmadam on 12th July 1990, Muslim leaders sought the intervention 
    of the Roman Catholic Church. It was the Mosque massacre 3 weeks later that 
    triggered a breakdown of communication and the recruitment of homeguards. 
    When violence did erupt, the Sri Lankan state did what it could to widen the 
    rift. The provocations against Muslims in the last year by the LTTE have been 
    far more serious. Tamils who have a vivid memory of equally deplorable violence 
    by Muslim elements, are generally careless about the sequence of events. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><a href="#Top"><span

  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:1.5in;mso-margin-top-alt:auto;
margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:1.5in'>&nbsp;&nbsp; The scene was a faculty meeting 
    in one of the two older and leading universities in the South, on 13th February 
    this year. The faculty concerned was presented with a request by the UGC to 
    take in 76 studnets displaced from the University of Jaffna. It was evident, 
    but not mentioned, that they were nearly all Muslims. The attitude to the 
    request was generally negative. One don said, &quot;If we had space, we could 
    have taken in more of `our' students&quot;. Another said that there was no 
    provision to enable students from one univesity to follow the rest of their 
    course in another. A faculty member (a Sinhalese) who was disturbed by the 
    direction of the discussion, pointed out that a precedent existed. The Ruhuna 
    University lacking facilities in its early days, its medical students had 
    been allowed to follow the more advanced parts of their course in the University 
    of Colombo and be awarded Ruhuna degrees. This fell on deaf ears. The discussion 
    proceeded as if he had not spoken. The request was then declined in polite 
    language which did not reflect the crudity of the discussion. An outside member 
    said that he was ashamed by the communalism displayed, but had not wished 
    to intervene on account of its being his last meeting. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; Thus among those who would shed the last drop of their soldiers' 
    blood to keep the country united, there was not the slightest inclination 
    to share in the trauma of their minority bretheren or to make sacrifices of 
    the kind that would give substance to the desired unity. Such is the communalism 
    routinely found in high places, that would make many ordinary people feel 
    shy. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; The problem of displaced Muslim students remains unsettled. Ad 
    hoc arrangements have been made for them to follow lectures in Southern universities 
    often without being allowed library facilities and without a sense of belonging 
    or being cared for. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; This is just one sign of the widespread prejudice that exists 
    in the South towrds minorities, with strong hint of contempt for the Muslims 
    in particular. This had spilled over into anti-Muslim&nbsp; violence in Galle 
    and Puttalam in the 70's. A recent incident took place on 8th May when about 
    30 policemen in civies stormed Jumma Mosque in Yonakapura, Dickwella, assaulting 
    Muslims at prayer, leaving six seriously injured. The incident took place 
    after a Muslim had refused to give his motor cycle to a policeman. [The Island 
    of 8th June, quoting M.A.C.Mohamed, Chief Trustee of the Mosque]. <a href="#Top"><span

  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:1.5in;mso-margin-top-alt:auto;
margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:1.5in'>&nbsp;&nbsp; Common contentions about 
    Muslims among Sinhalese as well as Tamils are that they are shrewd, conniving, 
    thick as thieves who will not give a peep into their intentions, grabbing 
    and so many other similar attributes. After the recent accidental fire in 
    a Tamil refugee camp in Kalmunai, resulting in some deaths, rumour quicly 
    took wing among Tamil children that some Muslims started it to chase away 
    Tamils. The expulsion of Muslims from the North by the LTTE was greeted outside 
    with casual approbation in many quarters. It was maintained that if you give 
    them a little room, they would climb on your heads. What we have recorded 
    earlier, shows that Muslims have suffered greatly and unjustly and suggests 
    that their behaviour is explicable in purely human terms. Given what the Tamils 
    have been through as a minority they should have been more sensitive to the 
    harm resulting from stereotyping. We shall examine some specific instances.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; A large number of Muslims, about 90,000, expelled from the North 
    mainly from Mannar, came into the largely Muslim Kalpitiya area north of Puttalam. 
    Most of then had lost everything. A Tamil lady, a rehabilitation worker, went 
    to some Muslim businessmen in Colombo and asked them to raise Rs.5 lakhs (the 
    price of the cheapest motor car) in order start a self employment project 
    among the displaced. After some prevarication it became clear that the money 
    was not coming. The Mannar Muslims then told her, &quot;We told you not to 
    waste time with Colombo Muslims. We knew from experience that they would not 
    give.&quot; The Muslim parliamentarians were no more helpful. At length she 
    went with some refugees and met a Muslim MP belonging to the SLFP. He generally 
    avoided the refugees and spoke to the lady. He promised to ask some Muslims 
    in London to support the project. In the end the money came from a church 
    organisation. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; The Mulims in Puttalam happen to be a very neglected and traditional 
    lot, while those from Mannar were often educated and enterprising. Soon a 
    clash of interests developed. Some of the Mannar Muslims began trading and 
    buying up land. Having been neglected in the past , the Puttalam Muslims resented 
    rehabilitation efforts directed exclusively towards the refugees. Once a small 
    provocation led to fisticuffs. Two Muslim O.Level boys from Mannar who were 
    refugees, went to watch a Tamil film outside the refugee area. Some conservative 
    local Muslim women came to the theatre wearing veils. The two boys asked jokingly 
    what they could see through the veils. As an angry crowd began to chastise 
    the boys, others from the refugee area rushed to join in a festival of fists. 
    All these experiences were an eye opener to the lady who had come with preconceived 
    notions about Muslims. She said, &quot;They are no different from the other 
    communities. Like Sinhalese and Tamils in Colombo, Muslims in Colombo would 
    be much more anxious about bombs exploding in Colombo than with the woes of 
    their bretheren in the provinces.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; We take some of the notions about Muslims in the Amparai 
    District&nbsp; and compare it with the situation in the Batticaloa District. 
    It is commonly&nbsp; said by Tamils in the Amparai District that Muslims commonly 
    provoked disturbances&nbsp; or used such to chase away Tamils from their homes 
    by violence to loot them,&nbsp; desecrate their temples and then remove all 
    the timber, doors and windows,&nbsp; and chop up their fruit trees so that 
    they cannot return. Their properties&nbsp; and paddy fields it is said are 
    then bought for a song. [We have dealt with&nbsp; the matter at some depth 
    in <a
href="\uthrj\Reports\Report7\Report7.htm">&nbsp; Report No.7</a> ]<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; Along the road from Araipattai to Manmunai in the Batticaloa 
    District, one sees the remains of an orgy of the kind so vividly described. 
    There are rows and rows of houses with rafters, titles, doors and windows 
    together with their frames missing and walls crumbling. What remains of red 
    polished floors and shells of shops speak of its past inhabitants as a reasonably 
    well to do community. There is also a ruined Mosque. This was the Muslim village 
    of Ollikulam, an extension of Kattankudy. What is more disturbing about this 
    is that it was not done by a group of hooligans with the tacit backing of 
    bribed policemen, but at the instigation and lead of the `sole legitimate 
    representatives of the Tamil speaking peoples' - the Tigers - early in the 
    current war. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; Other stories one hears in Kattankudy have a familiar ring. Muslims 
    had to flee the isolated village of Nochchi Munai and sell their land cheap 
    to Tamils, after the LTTE's New Year massacre of 1988. Karbala village was 
    developed as a National Housing Scheme project in 1981 and 40 houses were 
    built on Muslim land to which title deeds were held by Fareed Meeralabai. 
    This village, east of the main road, was also conceived as a means of linking 
    New Kattankudy with the isolated Muslim seaside village of Palamunai to the 
    south. Karabala village had to be abandoned after the disturbances of April 
    1985. Furthermore, Muslims cannot go out and cultivate, and the paddy fields 
    belonging to Kattankudy and Eravur residents on the other western side of 
    the lagoon have virtually passed under LTTE supervision. It is not surprising 
    if these Muslims see Tamils in their neighbourhood as envious and grabbing. 
    The LTTE, as well as other groups in the past have on occasions encouraged 
    them to loot Muslims under their protection. The Muslims could also contend 
    that they have not been wanting in generosity. The Kattankudy hospital which 
    is situated in Araipattai was built on land donated by a Muslim. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; The complaints one hears from Muslims inthe Batticaloa District, 
    are the mirror image of complaints one hears from Tamils in the Amparai District. 
    The two sets of grievances have different complexities involving interactions 
    between a chauvinist state and a flawed Tamil nationalism. It was last year 
    that the actions of the state agaisnt Tamils in the Amparai District reached 
    proportions of mass murder paralled with qualitatively similar actions by 
    the LTTE against Muslims and Sinhalese. However the temptation to wrongly 
    single out the Muslims for lumpen behaviour must be avoided. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; There is also a particular injustice that Muslims have suffered 
    in the Batticaloa District. Both sections of the popuation have found the 
    need for additional land becuase of natural increase. Thus the population 
    of Batticaloa town has expanded into new suburbs and old villages. The common 
    name Puthukudiyiruppu, symbolises new settlements. But the expansion of Muslim 
    residential areas has been comparatively limited and often strongly opposed. 
    The fates of Karbala village and Ollikulam are signs of this opposition. Kattankudy 
    is said to be one of the most densely populated areas in the world. One passes 
    through Eravur by bus almost before blinking a couple of times, and about 
    37000 Muslims live there. Many Tamils in speaking betray a feeling that they 
    have been generous enough and that the Muslims should not expand anymore. 
    It also contains the implication that this land does not also belong to the 
    Muslims. The feeling of being boxed in and hunted with their economic life 
    crippled, is unpleasant to live with, and in human terms, is one pregnant 
    with violence. We should be thankful that things have not yet gone out of 
    control. <a
