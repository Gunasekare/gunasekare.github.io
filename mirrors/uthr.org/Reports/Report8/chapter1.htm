  &nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp; When the war began a year ago the state appeared to be in a strong position. 
  Many thought that the state had learnt from a decade of blundering, while the 
  LTTE had made many enemies among its own people. The LTTE's triumphal entry 
  into Batticaloa in December 1989 resulted in 200-300 TNA conscripts being massacred 
  under the gloating eye of the Sri Lankan government. So little did the LTTE 
  care for the dignity and security of Tamils, that the remains of these hapless 
  victims were towed away in municipal rubbish trucks for disposal. It was the 
  same wherever the LTTE went. Only, unlike for the Easterner, the LTTE had a 
  little tactical concern for the squeamishness of the Jaffna man and his expatriate 
  contacts. He was thus spared such a public exhibition&nbsp; as in May 1986 when 
  TELO cadre were massacred where the public display was less in extent. In the 
  North the deeds were done in secret places - in lone cemeteries and in the Palk 
  Straits. The Sri Lankan forces gleefully obliged with aerial and naval support, 
  until 7 months later, on 11th June 1990, the government seemingly woke up to 

  discover that&nbsp; the &quot;law of the land&quot; was in need of restoration. 
  It nevertheless set about the task turning the law into utter shambles. <br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; To the Sri Lankan state's misfortune, it was drunk with the heady 
  wine of success against the JVP, and its hands were dripping with the blood 
  of slain southern youth. President Premadasa's promise of June 1990, to do to 
  the LTTE what was done to the JVP, was a bad omen. The specificities of an ethnic 
  struggle were not appreciated. While those disenchanted with the government 
  and the JVP in the South had other functioning opposition parties to fall back 
  on, once the government by its actions cornered the Tamils collectively, the 
  only functioning alternative the Tamils had was the LTTE. For those who rejected 
  both, the course was thorny, untried and uncertain, often hunted by both the 
  warring parties.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; When the war commenced, it looked as if the LTTE had miscalculated. 
  Its initial weakness was evident in the precipitate abandonment of well bunkered 
  defensive positions in the Batticaloa District. But venality combined with obtuseness 
  on the part of the state, linked to the LTTE's readiness to prosecute the war 
  without any obligation of responsibility and no concern for lives, worked to 
  the latter's advantage. Needless to say that the Tamil people lost irrevocably.

style='font-size:13.5pt'>A Confrontation in Batticaloa - the State's Nelsonian 
  Eye:</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The scene was the Town Hall in Batticaloa, about a week before 
  the tragedy in Kokkadichcholai of 12th June 1991. Addressing the people of Batticaloa, 
  the Prime Minister asked them to forget the past and informed them that normality 
  had been restored. With the PM on the platform were service chiefs serving in 
  the region, with some clergy and others sent up to improve the decor. Some of 
  the leading citizens who had been assured that the occasion would be more than 
  a monologue were dismayed when the PM proceeded to walk off the platform on 
  finishing his piece. In a gesture of apology, the DIG of Police who accompanied 
  the PM stopped him next to a Jesuit Priest who was introduced. <br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; The elderly Jesuit, a member of the Batticaloa Peace Committee, 
  told the PM firmly, &quot;You must not believe what is in the papers. There 
  is a lot of fear in Batticaloa. As long as there is fear and uncertainty there 
  can be no normality. About 12 persons have disappeared in the last week.&quot; 
  He then proceeded to name persons, some of whom had been picked off in public 
  view. One of them, Mariyadas, a mechanic, had only the previous evening repaired 
  the Police Superintendent's type- writer. There followed an exchange where the 
  PM attempted to push the line that now there was nothing to fear, things are 
  looking brighter and that disappearances would taper off. A few feet behind 
  in the PM's entourage was a general who, listening to this exchange, had been 
  getting&nbsp; worked up.&nbsp; As the PM moved off to his next audience, the 
  general came towards the priest, his forefinger wagging. &quot;Father, you must 
  know there is a war going on&quot;, he blurted, &quot;In a war people die. People 
  disappear. Look what happened in Japan!&quot;. One wonders who calls the shots 
  here, the General or the PM?<br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Next week the Kokkadichcholai massacre happened and others less 
  known followed. The PM too returned. The manner in which he was prevented from 
  meeting the victims, even in Batticaloa town, made it obvious that he was not 
  calling the shots. In the meantime the list of missing persons with the Batticaloa 
  Peace Committee, mostly from an area within a 10 mile radius of Batticaloa, 
  climbed to about 2500.<br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; It was evident that the army was in no mood to reflect on its collosal 
  failure. It was operating in the same frame of mind as when confronting the 
  JVP in the South. This is also reflected in a recent interview the Army Chief, 
  General Hamilton Wanasinghe, gave `The Observer'. He said that unlike the Sinhalese 
  public which supplied information that helped to crush the JVP, the Tamil public 
  is not doing so because of a fear of the LTTE. The corollary to this, as the 
  late Defence Minister, Gen.Ranjan Wijeratne, said almost explicitly during the 
  anti-JVP campaign, is that the state must become a greater source of terror 
  to the ordinary people than its adversary.<br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; A senior member of the Batticaloa Peace Committee said that they 
  did not raise issues when the LTTE was in charge, nor did they do any documentation 
  on human rights violations by the group, because it pretended to be everything 
  and was not interested in talking to or tolerating anyone else. That some officers 
  of the state now appeared to be responsive was appreciated, although little 
  that was tangible had happened. If the state was creative, it should have built 
  on this by conferring dignity and accountability to the people, thus rebuilding 
  its legitimacy in the nation building process, rather than contemptuously reiterating 
  how the people were silent under the LTTE's regime. <a href="#Top"><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>[Top]</span></a><br>

style='font-size:13.5pt'>The Political Establishment and the Media</span></b><br>

  &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; What is even worse is that the political establishment has not found 
  the capacity to tell the people the truth that great blunders have been made, 
  not just by past governments, but by this government as well, and that this 

  history will have to be re-evaluated and its direction changed. Instead it has 
  allowed the army and ordinary people to take the punishment for its absence 
  of direction, while it plays its desultory games. The current one is an attempt 
  to prove that Mrs.Bandaranaike through her electoral ally Chandrasekaran of 
  the UPF, supplied arms to the LTTE - a charge very remote from known facts. 
  Such are only seen as ploys to divert attention from&nbsp; shameful dealings 
  of the governments.<br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; In the current drift, what the Sinhalese public is told is extremely 
  unhelpful. While the press is taken to task for the slightest adverse comment 
  about leading politicians, the Sinhalese press in particular, is full off chauvinist 
  crap that can only be described as rabble rousing. Attempts to send food to 
  starving Jaffna folk were decried as feeding the Tigers and individuals involved 
  in such attempts are ascribed sinister connections without a shred of factual 
  support.<br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Armed forces personnel fed on such crap can only be more undisciplined 
  and alienating in their actions. Such reporting is obviously a contributory 
  factory to the shelling of the civilian population in Jaffna and the indignity 
  to which ordinary Tamils are subject even in Colombo, through sheer ignorance 
  and prejudice. <br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; In keeping with a politics that denies the people dignity and intelligence, 
  the state of hysterical insularity among the Sinhalese people, combined with 
  indiscipline among the forces, is dangerously reminiscent of the state of mind 
  resulting in the tragedy of July 1983. Chauvinism - whether of the Sinhalese 
  variety or the Tamil - makes a people small, foolish, and then violent. <a href="#Top"><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>[Top]</span></a><br>

  During July&nbsp; 1991 the LTTE launched its largest operation to dislodge the 
  army from the Elephant Pass camp. Preparations had been going on for a few months 
  by welding girders and improvised armour plating onto tractors which were used 
  to make suicidal thrusts to breach defences. It also showed that with the community 
  cornered by ruthlessly crushing any political alternative, rendered fools, and 
  the young brainwashed into thinking that they had only alternative forms of 
  death to choose between, the LTTE could wage a war without any concern for lives. 
  Victory or martyrdom - both abounded to the greater glory of the leadership.<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp; By now the LTTE was being credited with being a conventional army 
  carrying the Tamil struggle to a new glorious peak. For those whose eyes have 
  been largely on the military aspect of the struggle, the LTTE'S performance 
  at Elephant Pass was symbolic of a strong liberation movement, enjoying massive 
  support from the people. These were also sentiments of&nbsp; the very&nbsp; 
  people who have ignored ordinary Tamils&nbsp; their tragedy, their helplessness 
  caught between the callousness of two forces, and the resignation with which 
  they watch their young being cajoled, spirited away and then cornered into an 
  abject fate. Despite their stated repugnance for violence, without depth of 
  understanding, many socalled liberals become admirers of violent success and 
  contemptuous of ordinary people and their less romantic aspirations. Their shallowness 
  is such that they forget&nbsp; the lessons of history where the sudden collapse 
  of societies after astounding military successes, has shown them to have been 
  hollow within. What is of greater significance is the corrosive influences that 
  are legitimised within a society ever trapped into opting for pure militarisation, 
  spurning every sane alternative and pretending that such do not exist.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Thus those, including editors in the South, who have been obsessed 
  with the military scene and have persistently ignored the Tamil people, suddenly 
  plunge into awe for the LTTE, silence&nbsp; their war drums and speak of finding 
  a political solution. Elephant Pass suddenly wakes the government and the opposition&nbsp; 
  into mooting a parliamentary select committee to seek a political solution after 
  years of head smashing and foot dragging. Thus the inertia of the Sinhala chauvinism 
  of the southern polity in the end only leads naturally to admiration and legitimisation 
  of the destructiveness of the LTTE.<br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; One need not go far to discover the ignorance of those who romanticise 
  the LTTE. If the people of Jaffna are squarely and wholeheartedly behind the 
  LTTE, why does everything in Jaffna have to be a lie - from senior academics 
  who say, `one day we must all become great heroes', and are then not prepared 
  to take up stands when students are taken away over false allegations, saying 
  it is dangerous to talk about it, or send their own children to Colombo; to 
  the Diocesan Council of a church that wants the government to appoint a commission 
  to go into disappearances in the South as if it cared for the Sinhalese while 
  actually being silent on the continuing massacres of Sinhalese and Muslims by 
  the LTTE; to the leading Hindu religious personality who privately laments the 
  politics which drives our youth along the path of suicide and then speaks on 
  LTTE platforms?<br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Ordinary people&nbsp; who feel the tragedy in their bones, despite 
  the burden imposed on them by the community's history and by external factors, 
  through all the ambivalence and confusion long for the time they can live in 
  truth. <br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Every life that is snuffed out, whether martyr, traitor or civilian, 
  makes it more difficult for the LTTE to adopt a reformist course and face up 
  to its responsibility for this tragedy. What has been evident is a rise in hysteria 
  and sadism in the group which binds the Tamils in a fatal plunge.<br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; This is nowhere more evident than in the movement's unspeakable 
  attitude to Muslims. Some of the worst blunders made by the Sinhalese polity 
  in respect of Tamils are being inflicted on the Muslims by a group styling itself 
  a liberation movement of Tamils. Can any political force exercise benign power 
  in the North-East through humiliating the Muslims and ruling by coercion alone?

  <br>
  If these forces showed some confidence in March and some tendency to strike 
  an enlightened course of not punishing the Tamil people, these signs have been 
  overshadowed. The gains then made by stopping the aerial bombardment of Jaffna 
  and easing the supply of food and medicine have been thrown away. The new bout 
  of killing civilians through massacres in the East marks a disintegration of 
  discipline in the ranks, and an incapacity for conceptual reassessment at the 
  top. The fact that the appointment of a commission to go into the massacre at 
  Kokkadichcholai has made little impact in the day to day behaviour of the army 
  is indeed disturbing. The officers, even if they have the will, appear too frightened 
  to probe deeply and impose discipline [see reports]. <br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; In village after village in the East it becomes very evident that 
  the cause of the army's discomfiture is the license it received to breach the 
  law and inflict pain without accountability. In many villages the young are 
  missing. The army did not give them the option of staying at home. Many of the 
  remaining adults have been beaten repeatedly, often to the point of disablement.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; The only redeeming feature is that several of the intelligent officers 
  have understood the problem at far greater depth than the political establishment 
  or the press in the South. An STF officer told a citizen in the East, &quot;The 
  root of the problem is the inconsistency of the government. They have their 
  talks and make their pacts and accords. When these break down we are sent in 
  again. We lose our men and do the same horrible things to the Tamils. Whom can 
  the Tamils then trust?&nbsp; They cannot trust the government and they cannot 
  trust us. So they have to be with the LTTE.&quot; &nbsp;<a href="#Top"><span style='text-decoration:

  &nbsp; <br>
  We have stressed in previous reports that the most hopeful way forward is for 
  the democratic forces in the South to rise to the occasion and force the government 
  to take responsibility for the Tamil people. If the government takes the initiative 
  to respect the human rights of its people and give them dignity as people of 
  this country, the humiliation of having to bow to ambivalent strictures regarding 
  human rights from other powers can be avoided. One of the first tasks is to 
  defuse colonisation as a running sore. The Sinhalese settlement in Weli-Oya 
  has been much vaunted as a scheme to sunder the contiguity of the Tamil region. 
  High ranking STF men have admitted privately that there are `political reasons' 
  why security is being witheld for Tamils to go back to Pottuvil, Veeramunai, 
  Malwattai and Central Camp, from where Tamils were killed or driven away by 
  the forces last year. [see <a href="../../SpecialReports/spreport3.htm">Special 
  Report No.3</a>]. Such moves by the government are stupid besides being wicked, 
  because they perversely legitimise any action in these areas from attacks on 
  troops to massacring civilians.&nbsp; The LTTE gains in legitimacy when people&nbsp; 
  come to believe that only the LTTE and its methods can teach the government 
  a lesson and make it wilt. There must also be a credible inquiry, with a view 
  to providing redress on account of those thousands brutally murdered by the 
  forces.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; A chauvinistic politics has taught Tamils to blame everyone but 
  themselves. The motivating slogan of this politics is that the Sinhalese cannot 
  be trusted. The consequent disintegration of trust among Tamils themselves is 
  seldom acknowledged. To stubbornly insist that Sinhalese cannot be trusted is 
  not just a slap in the face to those who attempt genuine reconciliation, but 
  leaves the Tamils with just two destructive alternatives. For this politics 
  to succeed, it must constantly work to close every new crack in the ideology 
  of Sinhalese chauvinism in order to go on maintaining that Sinhalese cannot 
  be trusted. This is part of the logic behind massacring Sinhalese and conniving 
  at massacres of Tamils through provoking the worst instincts of the state and 
  the people. On the other hand if the state shows greater restraint and sophistication, 
  it could seriously embarrass the LTTE cause. <a href="#Top"><span
