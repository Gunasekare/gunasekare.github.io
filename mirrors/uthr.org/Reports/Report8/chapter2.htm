    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; The major event in this region during the period covered by this 
    report is the massacre at Kokkadichcholai, where ever a hundred civilians, 
    mostly women, children and elderly persons were killed and burnt by troops. 
    There had been many incidents during this war resulting in a large number 
    of disappearances, and several massacres with comparable or greater loss of 
    life. But this has been the first to receive widespread publicity, and a presidential 
    commission has been appointed to go into it. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; This situation contrasts with that prevailing particularly in 
    the Amparai District last year, where isolated communities were served by 
    priests travelling long and lonely roads on motor cycles. Not only were such 
    clergymen vulnerable (e.g. Fr.Selvarajah Saverimuttu of Sorikalmunai), but 
    many of the massacres which then took place have not come to light. [See <a
href="../../SpecialReports/spreport3.htm">Special Report No.3</a>]. Thus the press 
    in the South was able to pretend that the army had fought a disciplined war, 
    until, and very unfortunately, Kokkadichcholai happened. What we show here 
    and in the next chapter, is that the incident at Kokkadichcholai was part 
    of a pattern of army indiscipline and lawlessness. As a nemesis of its own 
    methods, a feeling of weakness and defeatism has crept upon the army. The 
    general sentiments such as the&nbsp; need for a political solution, that this 
    war is not against the Tamil people etcetera are not being transformed into 
    concrete deeds in every day happenings, by at least introducing&nbsp; an&nbsp; 
    institutional input into the military machinery, to ensure that its conduct 
    is consistent with those political goals.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; Because of the importance gained by the Kokkadichcholai incident, 
    we cover it in a separate chapter. The appointment of a commission, despite 
    a great deal of visible obfuscation, does provide an opportunity to bring 
    about some institutional change for the benefit of the people. It is also 
    hoped that this will not be treated as just an isolated incident.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; Both the STF and the army which control this area, have become 
    prisoners of the consequences of their own&nbsp; atrocious conduct, particularly 
    last year. They have found themselves fitting into a mould of coercion, casualties 
    and reprisals in an unstable environment.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; Because of the ingrained habit among the forces of punishing 
    the Tamils, and of frequent nastiness towards the young, there is a simmering 
    militancy among&nbsp; Tamil youth leading to steady recruitment by the LTTE. 
    For there is no other force to give them creative direction and hope for the 
    future. In many villages, particularly in the interior, there are few young 
    males left.&nbsp; We take one village, Kiran, [Section 2.3] and describe the 
    experiences of the people there. We also give a typical incident in one interior 
    village, Palugamam, of the kind that is bound to have serious repercussions 
    for the Tamils as well as the army. This is one among several which happened 
    after the appointment of the commission.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; In the STF controlled areas too there is a great deal of fear 
    among the young. Young persons are regularly picked up from market places 
    and off the roads and are beaten in camps during questioning. In the lanes 
    one does come across young persons asking `Are the commandos on the roads?' 
    before proceeding. During June, in Kallar, an O'Level student left home in 
    a group of 14 LTTE recruits, after telling his mother that he would rather 
    die fighting,&nbsp; than die sitting at home - an understandable sentiment 
    among most recruits. The mother not just lost her son, she is now harassed 
    by the STF and other groups.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;<span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&nbsp; Extortion</span><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; There is a particular spot on the outskirts of Batticaloa where 
    persons sent extortion letters are asked to report to the LTTE. Some are taken 
    westwards in the night, across the main road a short distance from the army 
    camp,to where they are held. Soldiers sitting in their camps by night know 
    that the LTTE is out there, moving freely. They become angry and blame the 
    people rather than their methods. Massacres are often the outcome of such 
    anger.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; Most members of the middle class in this region are very resentful 
    of extortion by the LTTE. For this impoverished middle class, receiving an 
    extortion letter not just causes fear and anxiety, but leads to so many other 
    problems. For one thing they just cannot afford it - a retired teacher from 
    Thurainilawanai with unsettled daughters, left for Batticaloa after receiving 
    a note of demand for one lakh of rupees. Further, if they go to the particular 
    area to meet the LTTE, the news spreads. They are then harassed by the forces 
    and the other groups would demand from them the same amount paid to the LTTE.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; Extortion is an important cause of people in the region being 
    deprived of necessary services. Early this year, the last Tamil doctor in 
    Kalmunai left after receiving an extortion note. In Batticaloa, it is said 
    that the services of many NGOs have suffered because many of their senior 
    Tamil employees have received extortion notes, and are thus not willing to 
    go too far from Batticaloa. Thus after the incident at Kokkadichcholai, only 
    two church organisations took relief into the area. The other NGOs distributed 
    relief from Thalankuda, on the other side of the lagoon. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; Most of those who received extortion notes appear to be sitting 
    tight, accumulating grey hairs. To them it must surely be a strong temptation 

    to go abroad and become vocal LTTE supporting expatriates, rather than serve 
    the people at home.&nbsp; Isolated Muslims are being picked off by the LTTE. 
    Notices have appeared to the effect, &quot;Pardon for Kattankudy, Death to 
    Eravur and Inquiry for Oddaimavady&quot;.&nbsp; Some Muslims were told by 
    a well-disposed Tamil who went for an extortion interview, that he was promised 
    a bungalow in the Muslim village of Kattankudy in return for paying the LTTE. 
    As for the LTTE's intentions, the Muslims fear the worst. The Muslims have 
    thus been given no choice but to depend on the forces.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; Tamils too on the other hand have come to depend on the forces. 
    Tamils travelling from Batticaloa would not pass through Eravur unless there 
    is an army picket on the road. The LTTE also appears to have taken up the 
    position but it would not allow any civil administration to function unless 
    it is given full control. Thus army and police pickets have been needed even 
    to bring food into Batticaloa, after the LTTE burnt 3 food lorries near Kiran 
    last November. Bus services and train services have also needed pickets to 
    function.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; Thus early in the morning to late in the evening one finds lines 
    of anxious young men along Trincomalee Road, stepping gingerly on the tarred 
    edges of the road, an automatic in one hand and a rake in the other, to ferret 
    suspicious looking bits of soil for mines. As experience has shown, these 
    are also the times they are most vulnerable. When there are no pickets, the 
    traffic ceases. When a mine explodes, the local people see the other face 
    of the army.<span

    <a name=c><b>2.2.1&nbsp; </b></a><b>The massacre at Sathurukondan:&nbsp; 9th 
    September 1990:</b></span><br>
    <br>
    The village of Sathurukondan, Kokuvil and Panniyachchiady lie just beyond 
    Iruthayapuram, the northern suburb of Batticaloa. Kokuvil is an ancient village. 
    But much of this area was settled recently as demand for land in Batticaloa 
    increased. During the evening sunset, the view from the huge lotus tank at 
    Kokkuvil is one of astounding beauty, with a large variety of wild birds flitting 
    along undisturbed. It is a refreshing sight for a Jaffna man, coming from 
    a place where the lotus has ceased to bloom and the ponds devoid of life. 
    The tank at Kokuvil was full at this time of the year because the fields in 
    the vicinity lie uncultivated. It is only now that the survivors have began 
    to trickle back, following the tragedy of last September. What follows complements 
    our earlier account of the tragedy. The date given in <a
href="\uthrj\Reports\Report7\Report7.htm">Report No.7</a> is also corrected.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; At 5.30 p.m. on 9th September 1990, armed men in uniform and 
    in civilian clothes came into the area and ordered everyone to come on to 
    the road. They were then marched to the army camp in the vicinity after being 
    told that they would be questioned and released. Since these were troubled 
    times, many had gone into the town and those remaining were mostly elderly, 
    women and the very young.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; What follows is taken from an account recorded on tape, given 
    by the only survivor, Kanthasamy Krishnakumar (21). The recording was made 
    before leading citizens in Batticaloa: &quot;50 commandos walked about 150 
    of us to the Saturukondan army camp, which we reached about 7.00 or 8.00 p.m. 
    Four were separated from the rest, attacked with swords and kris knives and 
    were pulled away out of the camp. All were then taken to one place, attacked 
    and burnt with tyres...&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; Krishnakumar who was injured, managed to roll out of sight in 
    the semi-darkness, crept away to a house and asked for water. He then went 
    to his village and stayed in an empty house, and later found his way to his 
    cousin's in Batticaloa town.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; The list of victims totals 184 (Sathurukondan - 38, Kokuvil - 
    47, Panniachchiady - 37 and Pillayarady - 62). Of this number, there were 
    47 children below the age of 10 and several women.<br>

    who are since missing. These were mostly students, labourers and fishermen.

    &nbsp;&nbsp; This and the two preceding items suggest that the taking away 
    of 179 persons from the refugee camp at Vantharumoolai Eastern University, 
    was one publicised instance of a practice widespread in the Batticaloa District 
    about that time. The testimony of the freak survivor at Satturukondan paints 
    a very grim picture of what could have happened to the others as well. The

    the current war began, went into the interior with the LTTE. His wife Yamuna 
    of Thambiluvil continued to work as a bank clerk in Batticaloa. Last December, 
    by prior arrangement, she crossed the lagoon and went to Kokkadichcholai with 
    some others to see her husband. According to some sources she was brought 
    back close to the jetty in a vehicle and that this had been seen from a distance 
    by the army. Yamuna never returned home. At the time of her disappearance, 
    one of her little children was with her mother in Thambiluvil, and the other 
    in Batticaloa. Later in April Karikalan's brother Satkunanandan also met a 
    similar fate because of a family connection with the LTTE.<br>

style='font-size:13.5pt'>Father and Son: August 1990 &amp; 20th December 1989:</span></b><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; This is one of many stories that illustrate how death has stalked 
    many families from several angles. Aruliah Rajasundaram (65) of Eralakulam, 
    was the father of six. His son Yesurajah (28 in 1989) was in the PLOTE and 
    had left for Colombo when the group was banned in December 1986. He returned 
    after the Accord to run a shop. His neighbour and rival had a brother in the 
    LTTE, and following harassment by the LTTE he joined the ENDLF. By this time 
    he was married and was the father of 3 girls. as the IPKF withdrew to Trincomalee 
    Yesurajah was invited to go with them. Being a familied man, he decided to 
    remain.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; Following the LTTE's entry, he was taken from Chenkaladi, for 
    questioning on 20th December 1989 on the promise that he would be released 
    after questioning. Then for 3 days, the family was refused any information 
    regarding his fate. On hearing that the LTTE had killed at least 20 persons 
    and buried them in a particular area, Rajasundaram, Yesurajah's father, went 
    with some help to dig up the graves in the night. One grave contained a bearded 
    man of about 60. His identity card in the shirt pocket described him as a 
    Vattavithanai. He is said to have spoken on EPRLF platforms. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; On the LTTE's entry into Batticaloa, 200-300 TNA members were 
    killed in town. Another 100 are known to have been killed in Iralakulam, on 
    the way to Trincomalee. During the period of `peace' which lasted until June 
    1990, a further 300 are said to have disappeared from around Batticaloa, which 
    was under Suresh.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; After the war began, in September, Rajasundaram obtained permission 
    from the army at Commathurai and went with a friend on bicycles to fetch a 
    young person from the Eastern University refugee camp. Rajasundaran was shot 
    dead on the way by soldiers. His friend escaped and brought the news.<br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp; The LTTE had fled Batticaloa abandoning a vehicle in the Teachers' 
    Training College premises. Out of fear, those in the training college pushed 
    this out onto Station Road. On finding out about the vehicle, the army took 
    in 7 youths about the place on 7th July, which was a Poya day, sacred to the 
    Buddhists. As the day ended at mid-night, seven gun shots were heard. Next 
    morning 7 bodies were found on the road.<br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp; About this time, a 15 year old nephew of Fr.Ambrose was riding 
    down Boundary Road on his blue bicycle. He was stopped by soldiers who sent 
    him to his parents' shop nearby to buy cigarettes. The soldiers then took 
    him along to the camp. The boy never reappeared. But his blue bicycle continued

    </a>Batticaloa: The disappearances of April-May 1991:</span></b><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; These were highlighted in Report No.7. On the morning of 24th 
    April 2 bodies were found near the police post at Iruthayapuram. On the same 
    day, two girls returning from tuition classes&nbsp; were taken in a white 
    van. In the evening, their bodies were found near the new bridge, where there 
    is a police post. Two bodies were found near Lady Manning bridge in Kallady. 
    Their heads had been removed by a v-shaped cut about the neck. One body was 
    found in Mankerni. The two bodies found near the Peththalai V.C. are believed 
    to be the work of a Tamil militant group operating with the forces.&nbsp; 
    Two bodies were found in Kaluwanchikudy. The 3 found in Kaluthavalai are believed 
    to be the work of the LTTE. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; The most prominent among those who disappeared was the LTTE leader 
    Karikalan's brother, Satkunanandan, who worked in the Telecommunications department. 
    There are circumstances here that give a pointer to who was behind the outrage 
    in Batticaloa town. One is that about this time (24th April), the A.L. examinations 
    were being conducted in the North-East and the question papers were stored 
    at Hindu College, opposite the Telecom. Being anxious to show that normality 
    prevailed in the East, the government wanted the examinations to go on without 
    interruption. Thus Batticaloa town was under heavy security at this time, 
    and a heavy guard was placed around Hindu College and the Telecom.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; Being an essential service, the Telecom personnel, including 
    Sathunanandan, were living in the building with permission from the forces. 
    There were also other factors. Those living at the Telecom had a pet dog. 
    On the night of 22nd April, this dog was poisoned. There were also six watchers 
    who slept in the building. Curiously, on the night in question (23rd), these 
    watchers did not sleep in their usual place. They had gone to another section 
    of the building. Satkunanandan was taken away on this night by hooded men. 
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; In another aspect to this tragedy, on the 23rd, a young man beat 
    his neighbour's cow, which raided his plot of sweet potato. In the ensuing 
    quarrel, the TELO got involved and the young man was taken away accused of 
    an LTTE connection. He was seen with his eyes blind folded near a well known 
    security establishment, by a responsible close relative who did not recognise 
    him immediately. The young man's body was found in the lagoon the next day, 
    in the company of Satkunanandan's.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; Our informant when asked how he was certain that the person mentioned 
    belonged to the TELO, said that the PLOTE did not operate in that part of 
    Batticaloa town. He further added that the TELO man was operating with the 
    notorious Captain M, who is widely credited with a number of operations of 
    this kind, and many murders. A senior figure in Batticaloa described Captain 
    M as a man of obscure origins, who was promoted to the rank of an army captain 
    after the commencement of the war, and now operates a special unit based in 
    Batticaloa prison. Other leading security officers, including the Brigadier, 
    had pretended that they knew nothing of these killings. Is Captain M some 
    kind of a scape goat, or is he a captain given so much power and autonomy 
    that even a Brigadier nominally responsible for security in the town cannot 
    call him to account? If the police had really wanted to investigate, they 
    had plenty of leads. They could for instance have started with questioning 
    the Telecom watchers. But their function is evidently not to uphold the law 
    of the land.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; According to leading citizens, there is widespread fear even 
    to admit that a close relative or even a son is missing. This is because of 
    an attempt by the forces to obscure and confuse. People complaining of someone 
    taken are asked how they were certain that the person concerned was dead. 
    Dead bodies had been found floating in sacks. One such sack floating in the 
    lagoon was found to have contained the body of a dead dog. People are then 
    made to wonder if other sacks too had contained dogs, and whether their relative 
    may after all be alive. This leads to a hope that the best chance of seeing 
    the person alive is to keep quiet and not make a fuss. <a href="#Top"><span style='text-decoration:

    &nbsp;&nbsp; We earlier reported the repraisal killing of about 12 persons 
    by the police in Iruthayapuram at the end of March. We add some information 
    that turned up subsequently. Following the killing of a policemen, the police 
    took in 15 civilians that morning. This was reported to the Superintendent 
    of Police, Batticlaoa - Mr.Moonesinghe. The SP then proceeded to the Iruthayapuran 
    police station, and returned after ensuring that the 15 or so persons were 
    released.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; After the SP went away, the Iruthayapuram police took in another 
    lot of persons. On this being reported, it is said that the SP visited the 
    station twice more, but did not find the people who were hidden away, presumably 
    in bunkers. Next day the bodies appeared. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; Officially, the police have maintained that there is no proof 
    of police involvement. But privately, some leading citizens were told that 
    the 70 or so policemen were taken to Amparai and questioned individually without 
    any further light being shed. They are then said to have been transferred 
    to Mannar, where several of them reportedly died in attacks by the LTTE.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; Assuming that all this which came from police sources has a bottom 
    of factual content, it points to a situation where some service chiefs at 
    least have serious misgivings, but are afraid or are reluctant to probe too 
    deep. Hiding prisoners during ICRC visits is after all an old ruse. It is 
    likely that the SP took the word of some of the senior officers at Iruthayapuram 
    rather than himself have done a search.<br>

    When the passengers got down and started running, they were fired upon with

    the course of which about 200 of them were killed. About 120 of them, mostly 
    young men, literally vanished in smoke after being taken in a round up in

    north. A short time earlier, the STF had established a camp at the edge of 
    Rufus Kulam, bordering Kanjikudichcharu, in the jungles of which the LTTE 
    maintains facilities. The attack was also read as an act by the LTTE to signal

style='font-size:13.5pt'>Pottakkulam (near Vinayagapuram): Early July:</span></b><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; We have remarked in earlier reports, that some young men who 
    left the LTTE last year, were also in hiding in the jungles west of Thirukkovil, 
    in danger from both the LTTE as well as the STF. It was only natural for them 
    to scrounge food from those who farm in that area. One such group of fugitives 
    was having a meal at the field hut of K.Sinnathurai, whose son was also in 
    the group, when they were surprised by an STF party, who had apparently come 
    on a tip off. Three were killed when the STF opened fire, among whom were 
    Paranirubasingam and Ruben. Paranirubasingam of Thambiluvil is said to have 
    been close to the former area leader Mathan, and was a tractor driver before 
    joining the LTTE in early 1990. The others escaped into the jungle.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; K.Sinnathurai was reportedly taken to the Thirukkovil STF camp 
    after being very badly beaten. His fate is unclear. The incident was reported 
    in the press as one where the STF successfully ambushed an LTTE party. Our 
    information is that the party ambushed did not even have arms. The villagers 
    were clear that they were no longer in the LTTE. Still no mechanism exists 
    for those with past LTTE links or those wrongly suspected of such links, to 
    ensure their safety. Such is the state of enlightenment governing this campaign.<br>

style='font-size:13.5pt'>Kalmunai: 22nd July:</span><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; Tamil refugees, mainly from Central Camp Division 4, were settled 
    in a piece of land bordered by the Telecommunications premises, the Methodist 
    Mission and Carmel Fatima College to the West. Towards the onset of the rainy 
    season at the end of last year, the Red Cross helped them to put up long huts 
    with line rooms for the families, made of coconut thatch. These had further 
    been covered with polythene sheets for rain proofing. With May came the dry 
    `Kachchan' wind. But the danger was not realised.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; On the morning of 22nd July, about 10.30 a.m the hut bordering 
    the Methodist Mission wall caught fire by accident - either by sparks from 
    a cooking fire or from an electrical short circuit. At this time most of the 
    adults were out on business. Those inside were mostly elders and infants. 
    Under the given conditions the fire spread rapidly. Those in the surrounding 
    areas saw smoke, heard the crackling of bamboo supports, and assumed that 
    a gun fight was going on. People thus stayed indoors. Some of the refugees 
    who were near enough to take alarm rushed to their huts. The belongings of 
    some were saved. Others lost everything including children.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; It was left to the STF to offer any concrete help, which according 
    to reports was promptly and unstintingly offered. STF men rushed into the 
    flames and rescued several elders who were trapped. According to some sources 
    5 infants and a lady died in the fire. The wife of a senior church figure 
    who visited the scene said that she saw 7 bodies of infants laid out. She 
    had also seen on STF man with burn injuries. The refugees have now been moved 
    elsewhere. <a href="#Top"><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>[Top]</span></a><br>

    &nbsp;<span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&nbsp; <a name=q><b>2.3&nbsp; </b></a><b>The 
    People are for beating - The story of Kiran</b></span><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; In order to get a total picture of how people in rural areas 
    are affected, we take one village. Kiran is 11 miles north of Batticaloa on 
    the Trincomalee road. It is not an interior village because it is on the main 
    trunk road to Batticaloa. Kinniyadi, Koralimadu and Karuwakerni are nearby 
    villages off the main road. But it is a rural area with a very small middle 
    class - mostly government servants and teachers. Because of its position, 
    the army is very much around, with camps in Morakkaddanchenai and in Kiran 
    itself. In recent times the village has had the presence of the IPKF, the 

    LTTE and now the Sri Lankan army. The people complain that every force tends 
    to accumulate the bad habits of the previous forces in addition to its own. 
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; When the IPKF went on the offensive in October 1987, nearly everyone 
    was beaten.&nbsp; When the IPKF began moving towards Batticaloa, the people 
    were made to sit on armoured cars and in trucks as human shields. Included 
    in the shield were the local doctor and the AGA.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; Following the onset of the current war, the army started moving 
    towards Batticaloa. On 20th June 1990, several bodies with cut injuries were 
    seen on the northern outskirts of Kiran. One man said that he had counted 
    13, but cannot say how many were killed by the army, because the bodies were 
    spread over a wide area. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; Many refugees then moved into Christa Seva Ashram, under the 
    care of Sevak Sam Alfred, and many of them later moved to the Eastern University. 
    In August 1990 a rumour went around that the LTTE had buried mines in the 
    surrounding area. The army was re-established in the area following the LTTE's 
    withdrawal after failing to overrun the army camp at Kiran.<br>

    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; The army then came to the Ashram refugee camp and took away about 
    60 persons. These persons were marched in front as mine sweepers, and the 
    army came behind. They were marched along several paths and were finally released 
    at Sungankerni. Some in the mine sweeping party complained that an ICRC vehicle 
    passed them on the main road, but did not stop to ask what this strange scene 
    was about. Instead they say that the foreign ICRC person exchanged hand waves 
    with the army and drove away.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; This incident may have other explanations, since the ICRC avoids 
    public confrontations. Unlike in Batticaloa town, the ICRC is generally not 
    understood in the villages. Skepticism about the ICRC in Kiran has remained, 
    and is thought of as being closer to the army.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; Also during August 1990, Perinpanayagam, a father of 3, went 
    to Siththandy on business with his 12 year old son. Both were taken in by 
    the army at Morakkaddanchenai. The son was later released. But the father 
    is since missing.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; On 26th September 1990, Pathmanathan, who worked for the Government 
    Press in Kiran set off to Colombo with a clearance letter from Captain Wickrematilleke 
    of the Kiran camp (now in Mankerni). He was arrested by the army in Valaichenai 
    and is since missing. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; During October 1990, 3 young boys, all aged 12, went to the outskirts 
    to collect palmyrah fruit. They are missing after being allegedly taken by 
    the army.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; On 23rd November 1990, the LTTE and the army battled each other 
    at Kiran junction. 4 shells fired by the army fell inside the Ashram refugee 
    camp, which them had 500 refugees under Sevak Philip. A child of 12 was killed 
    and several were injured. The army later provided medical aid.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; About this time, 3 food lorries were burnt by the LTTE at Kumburumoolai 
    junction.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; On 26th November 1990, Sundar (22), with two other residents 
    of Kiran set off eastward to the interior at nightfall, as the LTTE wanted 
    residents to vacate. They were stopped by the army at 7.00 p.m. and are since 
    missing.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; Apart from beatings, the situation was relatively calm until 
    April 1991. &nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; On 1st May 1991 John Selvarajah (35) who was carrying his infant 
    son was taken by the army with two others during a round up. His wife was 
    abused by soldiers in filthy language. When those at home protested, they 
    were assaulted with belts, gun butts and folded knees. The three were taken 
    to the jungle and were beaten and held from 11.00 to 4.00 p.m. One of them, 
    Karuval Krishnapillai died under beating. The other two were released. Selvarajah 
    is partially disabled, and has not worked for 4 months.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; On 11th June 1991, the first anniversary of the war, a curfew 
    was declared on the other side of the lagoon, and the army was out. Visuwaratnam, 
    Kanthasamy (24) of Koralimadu and Chandran were taken in by the army and were 
    tortured for several days. They were assaulted, burnt with cigarette buts, 
    creased with knives, boiling water poured over their bodies and were often 
    kept buried up to their necks.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; Viswaratnam is believed to have succumbed to torture. Kanthasamy 
    and Chandran were released through the police after 40 days of detention. 
    While in camp, they had seen four bodies of persons who had died under torture. 
    They have all the marks of their treatment, including burise marks down to 
    their legs. Kanthasamy is for all purposes a cripple. All his limbs have been 
    impaired. The use of his hands is limited. He can only move two fingers in 
    his right hand. At the time the three were taken, there was no incident involving 
    hurt to soldiers.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; On 13th June 1991 (the day after the Kokkadichcholai incident), 
    Sivaguru (26) teacher at Kiran MV, with his student Thangarajah Anandan, went 
    towards the sea to purchase fish. While returning, they were taken by the 
    army at the Cadju Farm at Sinna Vembu, bordering the railway tracks. After 
    this they were missing. Six days later, their bodies were exposed after being 
    dug up by wild boar.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; 10th July - Massacre at Kinniyadi. 13 bodies found and about 
    9 others missing. This is covered in the next chapter. There was no provocation. 
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; The extent of army indiscipline together with continual nastiness 
    is evident. That indiscipline is tolerated is seen in the day to day experience 
    of the people. Almost every adult in the village has been beaten, and many 
    of them cannot work as a result. Army patrols regularly force people to climb 
    coconut trees to bring down young coconuts for drinking. Those who cannot 
    climb trees are afraid to say so because they fear being beaten. Recently, 
    on being asked by soldiers, Gurunathan, who had never climbed a tree before, 
    agreed to pluck some coconuts. He fell down and lost consciousness. On recovering, 
    he found 100 rupees in his pocket. But the soldiers were missing. According 
    to Shanmugam, some times people accosted by the army are tied to trees and 
    left. He had released persons so tied. It is also said that few fishermen 
    go to sea on Tuesdays and Saturdays when army pickets are out along the tracks 
    for the train to go to Batticaloa. Many fishermen had been deprived of their 
    catches on these days without compensation. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There is also grinding poverty in the village, 
    once well off. This is because even those who can work cannot find adequate 
    work. Like in many villages in the area, a large number of the villagers used 
    work in rice fields across the lagoon to the west, which is more an LTTE domain. 
    Hence those going frequently across the lagoon become suspect by the army. 
    Unemployment is found preferable. People in Kiran are conspicuously thin and 
    aged before their time. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; About 50 have been killed in Kiran since the beginning of the 
    war and about 150, mostly school boys, have since joined the LTTE, according 
    to the villagers. The biggest reason for this is given as regular beating 
    by the army. As the number of young in the village noticeably dwindled, the 
    army found additional stimulus for beating. &quot;Why are you at home, why 
    did you not join the LTTE?&quot;, they would ask while beating. Sometimes 
    it is, &quot;You give us John or we will beat you,&quot; John being the local 
    Tiger leader. People say that even when there are Tigers in the village during 
    an army round up, they manage to beat everyone except the Tigers.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; People of this village have had the world brought to them. They 
    have seen a great variety of human beings and of human nature. There is no 
    communalism in them. There is little bitterness, much open mindedness and 
    no illusions. Despite all that they have been through, they are ready to laugh. 
    Laugh at what experience has taught them to view as their fate. <a href="#Top"><span
