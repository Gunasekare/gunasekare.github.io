  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:1.5in;mso-margin-top-alt:auto;
margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:1.5in'>&nbsp;&nbsp; In happier times, Kokkadichcholai 
    was renowned for the famous Batticloa curd. Pilgrims wanting this commodity 
    from the source,&nbsp; would have travelled six miles south of Batticaloa 
    along the Kalmunai road, turned right just past Kattankudy and Araipattai, 
    then through the Muslim village of Ollikulam to the jetty at Manmunai, and 

    by ferry across the lagoon to a point 2 miles East of Kokkadichcholai. Today 
    Ollikulam is in ruins, and the ferry does not function. The crossing is by 
    fibre glass canoes, generally two or three strapped together by cross beams 
    for balance. Passengers are invited to man the oars. On a calm morning, the 
    journey is memorable for the astounding beauty of the surroundings. Half way 
    across, Batticaloa town and its telecommunication tower become visible, five 
    miles distant as the crow flies.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; Now and then one does encounter bovine swimmers, a placid face 
    with gentle eyes, just above the water, towed by canoes going in the opposite 
    direction. Upon inquiry, one is struck by that very word that has become a 
    hallmark of Kokkadichcholai. These are creatures bound for the slaughter houses 
    of Batticaloa, taking their first swim, unaware that it was also their last. 
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; According to legend, the name of the village comes from the Kokkatti 
    tree, whose sap was really blood. From the jetty, one then goes westwards 
    through 1 1/4 miles of uninhabited, once marshy land, now having on either 
    side of the road, a network of square tanks with neglected bunds. This was 
    the prawn factory, abandoned since the STF massacre of January 1987. The area 
    then realised a death toil of about 120 which included a number of employees 
    of the prawn factory. At the end of this uninhabited area,&nbsp; one reaches 
    the Mudalaikudah Methodist Church on the left, followed by a junction. The 
    road on the left (south) goes to Mahiladitivu, and that on the right (north) 
    contains the main part of Mudalaikudah (Crocodile bay - it being said that 
    crocodiles hereabouts are not man eaters). If one proceeds straight, one reaches 
    the main hamlet of Kokkadichcholai 3/4 mile on. It is this hamlet that contains 
    the army camp. Although Kokkadichcholai is a collective name for the three 
    hamlets, the name refers to the main hamlet in local parlance.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; When food is brought for the army, a patrol would commandeer 
    a local tractor and set off to the jetty, posting sentries along the road, 

    with perhaps half a dozen&nbsp; men at the Methodist Church. Since this is 
    a regular operation, it is here that soldiers are most vulnerable, as experience 
    has shown.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; As for the people of this area, the dominant group is the Mukkuvar 
    caste - mainly farmers. Under them are the service castes-dhobys, barbers 
    etc. The caste system in Batticaloa is more easygoing compared with Jaffna, 
    and inter-caste marriages are common enough not to be frowned upon. Unlike 
    the Jaffna based Tamil nationalism which is based on the old kingdom of Jaffna, 
    the root of Tamil nationalism in the East springs from the notion of a self 
    contained autonomous system of villages, presided over by the Ur-Podiyar, 
    elected from among the podiyars. It claims to be egalitarian in spirit and 
    the role of the Ur Podiyar is considered more ceremonial than coercive. Podiyars 
    in practice were the large landowners. Like the use of Singh by the Sikhs, 

    it has become common for people of the area to prefix their name with Podiyar. 
    The Muslim villages of the area have the same structure, with Tamil service 
    castes playing the same role.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><a

margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:1.5in'>&nbsp;&nbsp; The army was out on a mission 
    to collect provisions from the jetty. When the tractor was returning with 
    provisions, a landmine was set off at a point on the road 1/4 mile from the 
    Methodist Church and 1/2 mile from the main hamlet of Kokkadichcholai, whither 
    the army was bound. Two soldiers in the tractor were killed. The time was 
    12.45 p.m. Immediately south of this point and along the road was an extension 
    of Mahiladitivu. Those responsible for the explosion presumably escaped through 
    this area. (Going further south, one goes through Paddaiandaveli, Pandariaveli, 
    and Kodukkamunai to Ambalanthurai). Following the explosion, more soldiers 
    started moving from Kokkadichcholai to the scene of the explosion. At this 
    camp, there is also a group of 10 militants who had recently broken away from 
    the PLOTE. Most of them are from that area and have wives, children or parents 
    living there. Some of this group too went with the soldiers towards the scene. 
    When they were disarmed by the soldiers, they realised that a plan was hatched 
    to punish the civilians. They went back to Kokkadichcholai (the main hamlet) 
    and warned the people to get clear. Those who could not run were taken, and 
    some went by themselves&nbsp; to the local school.<br>
    <br>
    <b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mahiladivitu</b><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; Sivapragasam Tissaveerasingam, a leading person of Mahiladitivu, 
    was attending to his lunch-time chores when the explosion was heard. A few 
    minutes later he heard small arms fire. He ran to the end of Mahiladitivu 
    and waited there. He then saw people running, chased by soldiers firing with 
    automatics. He ran a further 3/4 mile south and saw fire rising above the 
    village.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; A short distance from Tissaveerasingam's house is a mill belonging 
    to G.Kurukulasingam. Many of the people in Mahiladitivu who could not, or 
    preferred not to run away, gathered at this mill and in the house north, across 
    the adjoining lane. Over a hundred people were in this house. Among those 
    in Kurukulasingam's house with him were, his wife Puvaneswary and their children 
    Rupavathani (6), Nishantan (5), Suganthan (3) and Vivekananthan (8 months).Velupillai 
    Arunasalam is a carpenter who had gone that morning to Manalkadu, on the other 
    side of the lagoon, for his day's work. When the shooting began, his wife 
    Alikipodi Revathy and daughters Bavani (10) and Tharisana (1 1/2) were among 
    those who took refuge in the mill compound, which also contained the owner's 
    house. A group of soldiers came running along the adjoining lane from the 

    direction of Kokkadichcholai (west), entered the mill premises and opened 
    fire. Those inside the mill and the compound were all killed, and those in 
    the house injured. Four bullet holes which pierced the wall of the house are 
    prominently visible. Soldiers then went across the lane and shot Nallathamby 
    Subramaniam (80), who was on the verandah. This was seen by his daughter Paranchothy. 
    The rest who had taken refuge in that house were chased away.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; Velapodi Alaiyapodi (53), a farmer, was at Coloniadi Mill. He 
    saw 7 soldiers coming from the Methodist Church, firing their automatics. 
    They encountered Sivapragasam Thirumathi, who was chased away. He then saw 
    5 soldiers entering Kurukulasingam's mill, followed by firing noises. After 
    the soldiers left, he went there to see what had happened, and noticed 7 corpses 
    in the compound and 5 injured persons in the house asking for water. He fetched 
    water in a bucket and gave them. Just then another group of 6 soldiers arrived, 
    and though Alaiyapodi quickly went into the house, he had been spotted. The 
    soldiers asked him how many dead bodies there were and how many injured. He 
    gave them the figures. He was asked to bring the injured out of the house, 
    and to follow them so as to fetch a cart to take the injured for treatment. 
    Alaiyapdi went with them for a short distance, gave them the slip and came 
    back to a house two doors away. By this time several people had gathered at 
    the mill to see what had happened.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; Alaiyapodi saw the same six soldiers coming back. They thrust 
    about 35 onlookers into the premises and shot the whole lot, as well as the 
    5 previously injured. The soldiers then attempted to set fire to the corpses. 
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; Vyramathu Santhanapillai's daughter -in- law and Alahipodi Kunamani's 
    grand daughter, Ponnamma, was beaten while protecting her baby. Alahipodi 
    Kunamani's son Kumarasingam Shanthilingam was 4 months married. He and his 
    wife were in Sempar's compound. The young couple were among those dragged 
    to the mill and shot. Vijayakumari (19) was shot in the leg by soldiers while 
    running away. Her mother Theivanai was at the mill with her 1 year old child. 
    Both Theivanai and the child were among those killed.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; Among those killed in the mill, was a mother suckling her infant. 
    Evidently, the mother gave the infant her breast in order to quieten it in 
    the tense surroudnings, when the end came. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; Further from the junction and south of the mill was a concrete 
    house in which a large crowd of mainly women and children had gathered. Among 
    those there were Ponniah Visalatchi (55), a Colombo Chetty lady, her step-daughter 
    Kanagasabai Praba, teacher at Saraswathy MV and Praba's aunt Usumundapodi 
    Soundarmma (60). There were about 50 in the room, together with Visalatchi's 
    niece and a 1 1/2 year old child. By the time the soldiers arrived here, their 
    murderous passions appeared to have cooled. But they were getting other ideas. 
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; The women were subject to beating and abuse, and were asked to 
    go to the Kanniamman Temple, north and towards the junction. At the same time 
    a part of the house was set on fire. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; One soldier grabbed Praba, tore her clothes, held her tight and 
    began biting her. Soundaramma forced herself in between and covered her niece. 
    The soldier went into a rage and started kicking Soundaramma. One kick with 
    a booted foot struck her in the mouth, causing her to lose 8 teeth. Praba 
    managed to get away.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; About this time, the elder daughter of a prominent government 
    official was dragged by soldiers into the house. As the crowd moved the younger 
    daughter of the same official, a schoolgirl at St.Vincent's, Batticaloa, was 
    dragged into a shop on the opposite side of the road. A soldier attempted 
    to drag A.Kala, after prancing around with fierce gestures and making bestial 
    noises. Kala's sickly mother was not there. Once again Soundaramma, the sextagenarian 
    matron, strong though&nbsp; minus 8 teeth, intervened, grabbing Kala and interposing 
    herself. The beast become enraged and the face further contorted with the 
    noices even fiercer. Soundaramma was again assaulted, this time with a rifle 
    butt, receiving some hard shots on her back. Kala was shot at once near the 
    GS's house. She fell to the ground. A round of bullets then went over her. 
    She then got away.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; As the women reached the temple, the abuse became even nastier. 
    Variations of an expression many remembered, was that they would only entertain 
    the male organs of the LTTE and thus deserved to be taught a lesson. On the 
    way, the women met some unarmed Tamil militants who were normally with the 
    army, and had pleaded with them in Tamil to stop this. They replied sympathetically 
    that anything they said would not be heard. The women felt that the soldiers 
    were drugged. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; At the temple, Visalatchi who was also fluent in English and 
    Sinhalese, spoke to a man who appeared to be an officer, and pleaded with 
    him. saying that it is a sin to do such things to ordinary people who were 
    like his own.&nbsp; The man assured her that they would be safe in the temple 
    and started walking away. The women then spotted 3 soldiers with knives coming 
    towards the temple. She rushed after the `officer' and told him that his words 
    were of little use because the moment he left, others could do whatever they 
    pleased. The man came back, spoke to the soldiers and went away. Things were 
    then calmer. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; Throughout this period there had been firing and burning of huts. 
    Tissaveerasingam, his brother Sivalingam and 4 others cautiously approached 
    Mahiladitivu at 3.00 p.m. They retreated when the army fired at them. While 
    the women were at Kannaiamman temple and soldiers were about making threatening 
    gestures with knives and weapons, some unarmed soldiers also came there and 
    pleaded with the other soldiers to leave the women alone.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; After about 3.00 p.m. looting began in earnest. Soldiers got 
    busy removing valuables, including bicycles from houses and also trying to 
    burn the bodies. Soldiers were moving about very freely on bicycles till after 
    5.00 p.m. before going back. People identified the leader of the operation 
    as a bearded man waring a red handkerchief. The menfolk who had run away from 
    the village started trickling back towards nightfall.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; Mudalaikudah (North of the Methodist Church)<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; At 12.45 p.m. the time of the explosion, Motchamala Kanapathipillai, 
    a teacher at the nursery school at Kokkadichcholai maintained by the Red Barna, 
    was cycling home eastwards,&nbsp; her home being next to the Methodist Church. 
    Her father, Kanapathipillai, was the circuit steward in charge of the church. 
    Her brother, an employee of the prawn factory, had been murdered during the 
    prawn factory massacre of January 1987, Motchamala lived with her father, 
    her widowed sister-in-law and her brother's children.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; On hearing the explosion in front of her, Motchamala turned back 
    towards Kokkadichcholai. She was shot through the knees by soldiers coming 
    out of Kokkadichcholai - by men whom she recognised as those who came to her 
    house to ask for water and sometimes fruits.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; Later 17 youths were taken, mainly from Mudalaikudah, to the 
    crater left by explosion, where they were shot, killed and burnt.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; On hearing the commotion, the teachers at the Mudalaikudah school 
    kept the children inside and stayed there. Later in the evening the army came 
    and dismissed the students after beating the teachers. <span

  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:1.5in;mso-margin-top-alt:auto;
margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:1.5in'>&nbsp;&nbsp; Arunasalm the carpenter was 
    one of those who had waited on the other side of the lagoon, anxious for tidings 
    about his family. The boatmen who had brought their boats to Manmunai, also 
    brought news that much was amiss on the other shore. Little did he know that 
    Revathy and the two children had fled mortality leaving behind half burnt 
    corpses. On the 13th, people began trickling back to Kokkadichcholai, often 
    to burst into tears of agony on reaching home.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; The army stayed within the camp on the 13th. Among the early 
    visitors on this day were the Tigers, who after their absence from the time 
    of the explosion the previous day, had popped in to take a photographic record 
    of the handiwork.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; As the sun rose the corpses began to stink, and the stench was 
    carried by the dry kachchan wind. About 2.00 p.m. the villagers started burying 
    the corpses.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; A helicopter circled the area on the 15th. The army came out 
    about mid-day, asked the people what happened and returned. They were apparently 
    testing the ground for the next day's official visit, which had been announced 
    in Colombo.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; Even as late as the 16th, limbs were found in the crater with 
    bits of flesh sticking out. On this day an official party including the prime 
    minister, Bradman Weerakoon and MP's Casinadar, Joseph and Karunakaran were 
    brought to the Kokkadichcholai army camp by helicopter. The army maintained 
    that those killed were Tigers and that it was unsafe to go to the villages. 
    Joseph asked Karunakaran, &quot;You are a member of a militant group that 
    is now with the army. Tell me, are those who died Tigers?&quot; Karunakaran 
    replied, &quot;No&quot;.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; The prime minister's party was airlifted back to Batticaloa and 
    taken to the rest house. 100 yards away some of those affected were waiting 
    at the Kachcheri, Batticaloa's administrative centre, to talk to the prime 
    minister. This was, according to reports, disallowed on the grounds that it 
    was unsafe&nbsp; to go there. The Prime Minister, who earlier that month had 
    said that normality prevailed in Batticaloa, was&nbsp; now unable to meet 
    people at the seat of administration. Joseph protested to Colombo over what 
    he saw as groundless obstruction, saying that he was prepared to go to the 
    villages alone. He later met the people.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; By the 20th June changes had been made at the Kokkadichcholai 
    camp and a new officer was in charge. A group of visitors came to Kokkadichcholai 
    by vehicle after obtaining permission at the Manalpitty camp. On their return 
    the captain at the camp stopped them for cool drinks. He told them that this 
    kind of situation can hardly be avoided when you send village boys to fight 
    after a few weeks' training. He also said that he was in-charge of three camps, 
    the others being Vellaveli and Kokkadichcholai. &quot;Who is going to answer 
    if something happens again in Kokkadichcholai when I am not there?&quot;, 
    he asked. On 30th June a booby trap exploded at the ferry point while soldiers 
    were fetching provisions. Two soldiers were injured and taken away by helicopter. 
    Immediately the shops closed and people began shutting themselves up. An officer 
    went around asking people to reopen their shops and carry on normally. He 
    added, &quot;Today we die. Tomorrow the Tigers die. You need not worry.&quot;

    </a>In Batticaloa</h3>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:1.5in;mso-margin-top-alt:auto;
margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:1.5in'>&nbsp;&nbsp; According to a senior citizen 
    in Batticaloa, when on 12th June the news of the death of two soldiers in 
    Kokkadichcholai was radioed to the army command in Batticaloa, arrangements 
    were immediately made to airlift the magistrate and the JMO to the scene. 
    When the two were at the Batticaloa airport, they were reportedly told that 
    a second message had arrived making it necessary to cancel the expedition. 
    According to this message a second mine had gone off and&nbsp; it was now 
    unsafe. If this is true, it raises the question about the quality of information 
    given to the Batticaloa command, in addition to serious questions about discipline. 
    Or was it that on discovering that things had gone hoplessly wrong, the army 
    command was trying to cover up.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; Where covering up is concerned, there does not seem to have been 
    much change. According to the number count made by leading local citizens 
    following a house to house check, 67 bodies were identified and buried and 
    a further 56 were missing. Most of the missing persons are presumed dead and 
    cannot be identified,because like the seventeen burnt in the mine crater, 
    they had been mostly burnt to ashes. The rice mill had the largest number 
    of bodies - 43. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; The Superintendent of Police Batticaloa in discussions with leading 
    citizens was sticking to a figure of 32&nbsp; dead - this being the number 
    exhumed, for whom death certificates had then been issued. The police also 
    maintain that there was no rape, on the basis of certification made by doctors 
    in Batticaloa, who examined several of the women. But medical officers have 
    privately told leading citizens that there had been rape and that the doctors 
    are afraid to certify that. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; Like in almost all cases during the war, the police are not taking 
    steps to investigate anything. It is left to the people who are willing to 
    stick their necks out, to question people and collect evidence. The role of 
    the police seems to be to minimize the impact of&nbsp; evidence that has turned 
    up in spite of them. The proof of this is the atmosphere of terror in which 
    the JMO's, magistrates and the medical Officers function. The police who know 
    better pretend that this terror does not exist. Whether the commission of 
    inquiry can go beyond this insistitutional obfuscation is left to be seen.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; According to some sources with official contacts, several of 
    the men involved in the massacre had been transferred to frontline areas in 
    the North. <a href="#Top"><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>[Top]</span></a></p>

  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:1.5in;mso-margin-top-alt:auto;
mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;margin-left:1.5in'>&nbsp;&nbsp; Women of the area appeared 
    to have a sense of community, and were very open on the subject of rape and 
    molestation. when they come out with names, it is with a sense of personal 
    identification with the tragedy, without any hint of gossip. The rape victims 
    were themselves apprehensive. According to the women, at-least 6 of them were 
    raped. Two of them were sisters. The elder girl was found by her father trying 
    to cover her breasts with her plaitted hair. The second girl was found in 
    a shop building in a state of shock after some searching. All they said was 
    &quot;You would have heard what happened to us&quot;. According to the mother, 
    the elder girl was taking it up better, whereas the younger is refusing to 
    go back to her boarding school or even continue her studies. It was clear 
    that something terrible had happened to these girls. <span style="mso-spacerun:

    </a>What was behind this incident?</h3>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:1.5in;mso-margin-top-alt:auto;
margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:1.5in'>&nbsp;&nbsp; We have shown elsewhere in 
    this report that there was a general state of lawlessness and indiscipline 
    among the forces. From August to October 1990 when there were several incidents 
    of civilians disappearing in large groups of 30 to more than 150, there appears 
    to have been connivance at high level. The forces have thus been trained into 
    a mental frame that they have the power of life and death over ordinary civilians. 
    At ordinary times this leads to petty crime and beating, for which the civilians 
    have no recourse to justice. If they complain, they know that they will be 
    at the receiving end. In such a situation the slightest crisis could trigger 
    off a total breakdown. It also appears that the control exercised by the officers 
    is also minimal. After training the men to kill and loot, the officers too 
    would have much to fear if they were to try and impose unaccustomed restraint. 
    Under these circumstances, the high command is bound to receive little honest 
    information, if they wanted it.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; If some form of discipline had existed in the camp, at-least 
    by 1.30 p.m. whoever was in charge should have known that something was seriously 
    amiss. Thus even if only a section of the soldiers had planned the reprisals, 
    not long afterwards the whole camp would have been concerned in the matter. 
    Why was this allowed to go on for four hours? It also appears that not long 
    after 1.00 p.m. the high command in Batticaloa was also aware that something 
    was going on. The long duration suggests either complicity or a serious breakdown 
    in the chain of command. As we said earlier, this was to be expected.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; The bestiality displayed during rape and molestation points to 
    something seriously disturbing. It shows up the army as something totally 
    alien, where the people are concerned-the very thing that accounts for the 
    success of massacre politics. <a href="#Top"><span style='text-decoration:none;

margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:1.5in'>&nbsp;&nbsp; Soundaramma was taken to 
    Batticaloa hospital by Rasathurai from Thalangkuda and was warded for eleven 
    days. She has now been rejoined in Mahiladythivu by her two grandsons and 
    nephew who had fled. Mothchamala was in Batticaloa hospital for 40 days and 
    now with relatives in Kallady. Soundaramma had been urinating blood for some-time. 
    Alavapody Nagarajah is a small made, mild, innocent man, slow of speech. He 
    was mercilessly assaulted by soldiers who also broke up everything in the 
    house.&nbsp; Nagrajah was admitted to the hospital with injuries and a swollen 
    stomach, and was kept in the hospital for 9 days. He still has a urinary problem.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; Except for the limited relief brought by the Methodist and Roman 
    Catholic churches, no relief agency had come into the area until late July. 
    Most of these agencies distributed relief on the other side of the lagoon 
    at Thalankuda, to those who have left the area. Normal life there is unusually 
    difficult. At one time&nbsp; bus service used to operate between the jetty 
    point and Kokkadichcholai. Now except for those who had crossed bringing along 
    bicycles, the others have to walk anything from 1 1/2 to 2 miles, often in 
    the scorching sun. There used to be a government dispensary. The army said 
    that the Tigers were taking medicines and wanted the dispensary to function 
    inside the army camp. As the result there are no medical facilities now. The 
    most primitive methods have to be used to get a patient across to hospital 
    in Batticaloa or Kattankuddy.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; Although organisations and individuals are persuading the people 
    to go before the commission&nbsp; inquiring into the massacre, the people 
    remain deeply suspicious. Their experience since the event has not given them 
    confidence. A common remark to be hard is, &quot;After putting us through 
    all the trouble of giving evidence, they are likely to put the blame on us.&quot; 
    However the people are said to have gained confidence <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; after the first hearings in Batticaloa.</p>

    </a>The politics behind massacres:</h3>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:1.5in;mso-margin-top-alt:auto;
mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;margin-left:1.5in'>&nbsp;&nbsp; Behind the massacres 
    of Tamils that have been going on for the last few years, two aspects stand 
    out, resulting from the political bankruptcy of both sides. On the side of 
    the state there is an undisciplined army, increasingly frustrated and prone 
    to use vindictive terror to its own detriment. On the other is a force that 
    received legitimacy because the people wanted their life and dignity protected, 
    but because of its political bankruptcy, must rely on government massacres 
    for propaganda and recruitment.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; We have pointed out earlier <a
href="\uthrj\Reports\Report6\Report6.htm">[Report No.6</a>], that this particular 
    political tendency could necessarily brook no rivalry. When several militant 
    groups functioned until five years ago, competition among them, made them 
    sensitive to the need to safeguard civilians. Thus when the Chavakacheri Police 
    Station was attacked at the end of 1984, the approaches to the area were mined 
    in order to delay the army's arrival. This gave the civilians time to get 
    away.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; In the case of Kokkadichcholai, while there was 1 1/4 miles of 
    uninhabited stretch, the mine was placed near a populated area. Beginning 
    a short time later, a small number of soldiers ran amok for 4 hours without 
    hindrance. The militant party came in the morning&nbsp; for its photographs. 
    It was also essential that no one in the village should have any idea that 
    a mine was planted, if this kind of attack was to succeed. Thus the rebels 
    come and go from day to day, asking for one thing or the other. People take 
    their presence for granted. One night, presumably, a mine quietly is planted. 
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; In all the cases that we have encountered over the years, as 
    strongly as the people concerned are angry with the conduct of the army, they 
    are far from taking kindly to the manner of being let down by their liberators. 
    The latter have in many instances, taken no trouble to hide their motivations. 
    On occasions they have said that a target of so many thousand civilians must 
    die for the militant struggle to receive international recognition. Sometimes 
    the camera men have come and expressed disappointment that only a small number 
    had got killed in reprisals. The people are in general terrified to talk about 
    it. To start with they are usually legalistic - `How can we say the LTTE planted 
    the mine? There are so many armed groups coming and going with similar uniforms, 
    etc.' But when trust is established, a different record comes out - `Yes, 
    it was them. If they had just fired two shots, the army would not have come. 
    They would have called the helicopter gunships. But the people would have 
    got away. But defending the people had not been on the agenda when they had 
    planted the mine. When the present politics destroys humanity, fighting for 
    human rights virtually involves fighting against this politics. Even in village 
    after village where the Sri Lankan forces have swelled the ranks of the LTTE, 
    the question is asked, &quot;Did we need all this death and destruction? Was 
    it necessary for our sons to die?&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:1.5in;mso-margin-top-alt:auto;
margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:1.5in'>&nbsp;&nbsp; In this section we look into 
    the matter of how the appointment of the inquiry commission has affected the 
    conduct of the army, and whether the army is developing any mechanisms to 
    ensure that such tragedies will not happen again. This will also suggest to 
    us whether the commission has already lost its momentum or not. We let the 
    incidents speak for themselves. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><a

  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:1.5in;mso-margin-top-alt:auto;
margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:1.5in'>&nbsp;&nbsp; About 7.00 a.m. when the 
    people of Palugamam were getting ready either to go to work or to go to school, 
    the army ordered everyone to come to the compound adjoining the Palugamum 
    M.V.(High School). When&nbsp; the people were assembled, 3 youths were picked 
    up by the army. These were two students, Murugesapillai Navaneethan and Logitharajah 
    Vallipuram, both A.L. students at the school, together with another youth, 
    not in school. Murugesapillai, a retired teacher, is a famous snake-bite physician. 
    The young men were marched into the school, and were subject to severe beating 
    on the stage. Those who went there after the incident found several fragments 
    of sticks and blood stains on the stage. Later in the morning a lorry arrived 
    at the school gate,&nbsp; bringing new furniture for the school. The soldiers 
    had the furniture unloaded outside and took the lorry inside the school. The 
    three detainees were loaded into the lorry and the lorry was brought back 
    with its back end covered. The driver and the cleaner were then ordered to 
    get into the back of the lorry, which was then driven to the army camp at&nbsp; 
    Poraithivu. The driver and the cleaner were then made to get out at the entrance. 
    The lorry was then taken inside and brought back empty. The three youths have 
    since been missing. The little information the people have, makes them pessimistic. 
    Two days later, on Monday, the students of the school washed the blood stains 
    from the platform. The youth detained, it is said by the villagers, had nothing 
    to do with the LTTE. Navaneethan in fact had been shot in the knee by the 
    IPKF, and was lame<span style="mso-spacerun:

    </a>Massacre at Kinniyadi: 10th July</h3>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:1.5in;mso-margin-top-alt:auto;
margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:1.5in'>&nbsp;&nbsp; Kinniyadi is a village on 
    the shore of the lagoon, west of kiran. It is generally known that when the 
    LTTE, who have the freedom of movement on the other(interior) side of the 
    lagoon come into the Kiran area, they move in the vicinity of Kinniyadi. As 
    the result, the army is also harsh when it comes into this village. Consequently 
    when the villagers learn that the army is coming, the young men go to the 
    other side of the lagoon rather than risk punitive&nbsp; beating or worse. 
    Thus when the army used to&nbsp; come and find the young men missing, it used 
    to become more angry. Crossing the lagoon is something familiar to the villagers, 
    because they have their fields on the other side. They also know where the 
    water is shallow, permitting them to cross on foot or swim.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; On this day when the army came just after 3.00 p.m., on receiving 
    intelligence the villagers as usual tried to get away from the village, without 
    realising the proximity of the soldiers. Several of them were apprehended 
    by the soldiers. These men were taken to the lagoon shore and then shot dead.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; 13 bodies of those killed were recovered and funeral rites were 
    conducted. Upto about 8 more are said to be missing. The thirteen whose bodies 
    were discovered are: Murugan, Karunakaran, Shanmugam Chandran, Sinnathamby 
    Pakianathan, Sivendran, Saravanamuthu Sounderalingam, Ravindra&nbsp; Alagiah, 
    Sonarami Krishnan, Sinnathamby Krishnapillai, Kandiah Chinnaan, Karuval Kurukulam, 
    Mylvaganam Thangarajah, Vairamuthu Chinnathamby and Ponnuchamy Sethuraman.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; The incident was not reported in any of the national dailies 
    except the `Veerakesari', a Tamil daily published in Colombo. It was reported 
    in the government media that several Tigers were killed. This distortion has 
    impeded relief workers going into that area, because of a fear of the forces. 
    The villagers have virtually been isolated, with even church organisations 
    fearing to go there. The villagers are clear that neither were any of the 
    dead LTTE, nor were any armed. According to a senior citizen in the area, 
    only the Ceylon Red Cross went there the following day. They also went off 
    after asking the families to come to Batticaloa and register. This did not 
    seem very helpful, as the families are at a loss about formalities and feel 
    afraid.<span

  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:1.5in;mso-margin-top-alt:auto;
margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:1.5in'>&nbsp;&nbsp; On this day the train was 
    to come to Batticaloa and army pickets were out to provide security for the 
    train. A land mine attack by the LTTE about 10 a.m. resulted in 7 soldiers 
    and a member of the TELO being killed. Perhaps because the inquiry commission 
    into the Kokkadichcholai incident was due to convene in a day or two, army 
    reprisals took a novel form. Travellers on the Batticaloa - Trincomalee Road 
    the following morning were confronted with a new gimmick at the Kommathurai 
    camp. People in buses as usual got down and queued up for checking. The soldier 
    who was to check the bags slapped many of the passengers as they came. There 
    was little interest in looking for bombs in bags. Those who were slapped were 
    generally slapped several times with both hands and included women. Those 
    frequently singled out were old villagers wearing `Verti', who could be seen 
    progressively lowering their heads as the slaps followed. Another soldier 
    stood with an improvised whip made of electrical wire, doing his own thing. 
    This reportedly went on for 3 days. The officers managed to stay out of sight. 
    The number so treated would run into hundreds. Yet another soldier was standing 
    with a pole, to hammer people bulging out of Batticaloa's over crowded, `push-start' 
    buses. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><a href="#Top"><span

    A History of Obfuscation:</h3>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:1.5in;mso-margin-top-alt:auto;
margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:1.5in'>&nbsp;&nbsp; In this section we take up 
    the question of how responsive the forces have been, to representations made 
    by citizens' bodies and individuals. The Batticaloa Peace Committee has made 
    regular representations with regard to missing persons. On the 29th and 30th 
    August 1990, the peace committee sent letters to the military authorities 
    in Batticaloa, one with a list of over 400 missing persons in the Batticaloa 
    area. The secretaries to the peace committee were Chellian Perinpanayagam 
    and Arunagirinathan. Sometime in August 1990, A.Martin took over from Arunagirinathan.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; On 21st September a reply was received from Brigadier A.N.U.Seneviratne 
    of Head Quarters, 3 Brigade Group, Batticaloa. He acknowledged that 3 persons 
    in that list of 400 had been taken and handed over to the D.I.G. for legal 
    action. The reply added &quot;Please note that no other person in the referred 
    list was taken into custody by the security forces under this head quarters&quot;.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; The other letter had referred to the discussion with the Brigadier 
    of 25th August 90, and enclosed two schedules of missing persons totalling 
    67, mostly school boys. `A' schedule contained missing persons from the Batticaloa 
    district, including youth of the Chenkallady and Pullumalai Brigades. Schedule 
    `B' referred to the Amparai district. The reply acknowledged only one as having 
    been taken.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; On the 20th of September 90, the defence ministry was sent a 
    list of names of 158 persons taken from the Eastern University refugee camp 
    on 5th September.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; A reply dated 17th October 1990 was sent from the office of the 
    Minister of State for Defence, signed by Air Chief Marshal A.W.Fernando, Secretary. 
    31 persons were acknowledged as having been taken, and their names given. 
    Not one of them is known to have surfaced although they are said to have been 
    released.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; On 9th October 1990 the peace committee wrote to the authorities 
    about the incident at Sathurukondan of 9th September, with a list of 184 missing 
    persons. This was followed by a letter about the army going to Savukkady, 
    after which 31 persons were missing. On 11th October, about the incident at 
    Chithandy (21 August), after which 44 persons were missing. No satisfactory 
    replies have so far been received.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; In recent times we have had&nbsp; the killings by the Iruthayapuram 
    police in late March, the disappearances of April/May and the incidents described 
    in the current report. None of these has been investigated. <a href="#Top"><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>[Top]</span></a></p>
