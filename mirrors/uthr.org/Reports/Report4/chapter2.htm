    </center>
    <font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><br>
      <font color="#990000"><font size=+2>W</font>hen the war broke out on 11th 
      June, there were many sceptics throughout the country who said that both 
      sides needed it. A conspiracy may be hard to establish. It may more correct 
      to say that the war was brought about by ways of reacting to situations 
      and habits of mind, that were on both sides essentially anti-democratic. 
      Once the tactical use of rapproachment was over, the host of political problems 
      had to be faced. The human needs and basic rights of the Tamil and sinhalese 
      people had not been addressed. Sinhalese people were becoming unconvinced 
      of the utility of the deal with the Tigers. The opposition was more vocal 
      in challenging the government's human rights record. Moves to privatise 
      the CTB were being widely questioned and a strike by CTB workers was being 
      threatened. Moreover, the security establishment, the strong arm of Sinhalese 
      nationalism, consuming a very much larger part of the budget (14%) than 
      health or education, stood discredited in the South as well.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">In the Tamil areas the disquiet with the prevailing 
      order has been mentioned. The Muslim issue had not been addressed. The 
      Amnesty International statement (the Island 1st June) which said: "It (the 
      LTTE) appears to condone and threaten the extra judicial execution of those 
      it considers `traitors'.....", went on to charge the group of carrying out 
      summary executions of purported criminals, and recommended that the ICRC 
      be allowed access to its detainees. This was symptomatic of increasing 
      doubts about the group's credentials internationally- something on which 
      the group placed a high premium. Whenever in the past the LTTE had been 
      engaged in combat with a powerful but oppressive army, which assuaged its 
      fury in civilian reprisals, it had its strength and credibility enhanced.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">For the Tamil people, however, the possibilities 
      looked fairly bright. During the past few months, most leading educational 
      institutions in Jaffna had either gone on tours of the South, or had advanced 
      plans to do so. Likewise, pilgrims from the South were once more visiting 
      shrines in the North. Communal feelings were being slowly eroded. There 
      was also a strong feeling in the South, given the economic difficulties, 
      the massacre of thousands of young and misgovernment, that it had its own 
      deep seated problems and that the Tamil problem must somehow be laid to 
      rest. This was reflected in the `Sun' editorial published as late as 15th 
      June, after the conflict had commenced.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">"Instead of seeking the impossible, we have also 
      suggested the creation of a Federal system under which the Tamil minorities 
      in the North and East could have greater autonomy in their affairs, thus 
      preserving the unitary status of Sri Lanka. An urgent political solution 
      to the current crisis is therefore the most sensible fait accompli...."</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">`The Sun' was a paper which catered to a readership 
      that did not take a soft line on the Tamil issue. The term Federal system 
      was for long a dirty word in southern political discourse and would once 
      again become so as the conflict progressed.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">Even if such a promising situation had arisen without 
      good intentions on either side, the response of anyone interested in the 
      well being of Tamils and perhaps of the sinhalese, would have been to encourage 
      this trend. Every political move should have been made to marginalise the 
      role of the military. No government could have politically justified such 
      a heavy military expenditure as against health, education and the needs 
      of the poor, by saying that it was afraid of the sinhalese. It would have 
      had to use a real or imagined Tamil threat. With the role of the military 
      marginalised, it would have served both Tamil and Sinhalese interests to 
      give the Southern opposition a free hand in challenging the government's 
      human rights record. Such developments would not only have posed a challenge 
      to the Sinhalese chauvinistic ideology, but were also a threat to Tamil 
      political ideology based solely on military prowess, conformity and a constant 
      feeling that the Tamils were under physical threat.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">All this may not have been decisive in either side 
      consciously precipitating the war. But it would have influenced their responses 
      to a series of challenges over a time which resulted in the war. Take for 
      instance the `fait accompli' of spelling out a political solution that seemed 
      a simple way out for an ordinary commonsensical `Sun' editorial writer. 
      The government has failed to put one forward from the time it started talking 

      to the Tigers 15 months ago. Its failure to do it even now only weakens 
      its position.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">As has been said often, the immediate issue that 
      triggered off the war is certainly not the quarrel between the Tigers and 
      the Batticaloa police over a civilian's illicit love affair. The Tigers 
      had themselves reported in their media on 3rd June that talks on settling 
      differences between themselves and the government were going well. It appears 
      that the government had earlier given word to the Tigers that 4,000 - 5,000 
      persons named by them would be regularised as part of the army, police or 
      both. This was strongly suggested in private conversations of senior LTTE 
      members from the middle of 1989. About this time the government had also 
      announced that recruitment to the forces would be on ethnic proportions 
      - i.e. 18% Tamils. From the time the IPKF departed, the government, for 
      whatever reason, does not seem to have moved on this matter. June appears 
      to have been a kind of deadline agreed previously. A number of influential 
      Tamils who wanted to start rehabilitation projects in the North-East were 
      told by the Tigers to wait till June starting anything big.</font> <br>
      <font color="#990000"></font> <br>
      <font color="#990000">10th June appears to be the new deadline agreed after 
      talks earlier in the month, for action on regularisation. (See Kautilya's 
      column, Sunday Island, 22nd July). The attack on the army column in Vavniya 
      which ignored orders to stop on 8th June, appears to be a signal of impatience. 
      Why the government had not acted by the 10th June is not known. From April 
      1989, the whole process of government-Tiger talk proceeded with several 
      loose ends hanging. This became evident in differences between the Sri 
      Lankan forces and the Tigers, as the IPKF moved out.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">The Tigers seem to have decided to show their hand 
      by taking over all police stations from 11th June and challenging the movement 
      of Sri Lankan forces, perhaps expecting fresh negotiations. this marked 
      the commencement of the conflict. Once the conflict was in progress, it 
      evoked a variety of rather unexpected reactions. Several southern villages 
      which had suffered grievously during the government's counter-terror against 
      the JVP, expressed satisfaction at armed forces' causalities by firing crackers, 
      putting up banner and writing graffiti on walls. A number of Sinhalese 
      of all ages and classes expressed feelings the outrage against the tigers 
      for giving the armed forces the opportunity to reassert their legitimacy 
      as saviours of the nation after with what they had done in the South; and 
      also providing the government with a diversion to sweep all its misdoings 
      under the carpet. Many of them admit that the South is in for worse times 
      and that there will be no prospect of issues of basic justice being addressed 
      in the South until Tamil politics of the kind is militarily subdued. For 
      this reason they would take a fatalistic view of the current fate of Tamils.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">There were many Tamils who were incensed that the 
      government was getting away with grossly false propaganda. they are also 
      angry with the Tigers accusing them of having acted as decoys for the government: 
      First to get the IPKF out and to topple a legally constituted provincial 
      government without any hint of a political settlement. They say that the 
      government deliberately strengthened the Tigers and put them in the place 
      of the EPRLF, so as to regain the military option denied to them after India's 
      entry in 1987. They point out that the EPRLF was so weak that the government 
      could never have legitimised a military option with them in control of the 
      North-East.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">It is only fair to say that the government and the 
      army would be divided on such matters. There would be many in the government 
      who would rather do politics without violence and military men concerned 
      about sullying the reputation of the armed forces by killing civilians. 

      But certain sections are bound to seize opportunities, appeal to dominant 
      ideological presumptions and self interest and argued convincingly that 
      no other option is open.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">On the part of the tigers, their decision to confront 
      the state forces may be argued as a logical necessity. But such necessity 
      only arose through a series of actions and deals without reference to basic 
      human values. Any political force seen to be respecting truth and justice 
      could have found sounder means to secure its legitimate demands.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">We give below the sequence of events pertaining 
      to the conflict as recorded in the press:</font><font color="#990000"></font>

      which ignored orders to stop, killing a corporal and wounding 9 soldiers.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">10th June: 300 Tigers surrounded Batticaloa police 
      station after a quarrel over the police assaulting a civilians and proceeded 
      to occupy it.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">11th June: Tigers ordered police personnel in the 
      East to vacate all police stations with their families by 2.30 p.m. or to 
      face the consequences. By noon hundred of policemen and their families 
      had streamed into security forces camps and air forces camps. In Batticaloa, 
      Tigers arranged refugee accommodation for Tamil policemen in a nearby school. 
      Sinhalese refugee from a camp were taken air force base.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 

    <p><font color="#990000">At Kalmunai tigers engaged an army convoy returning 
      after purchasing provisions, killing 10 soldiers. At Kalmunai and Kalawnachikudi 
      police stations, fierce fighting raged before the policemen surrendered. 

      At Kalmunai, 8 policemen were reported killed. The LTTE had also suffered 
      casualties - 2 killed and 17 injured according to reports.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">Most police stations appear to have surrendered 
      without a fight. By the end of the day, the Tigers were in control of 9 
      police stations - Batticaloa, Vellaveli, Kalmunai, Valachenai, Kalawnchikudi, 
      Samanthurai, Eravur and Akkarapattu.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">In the Kalmunai area, a number of policemen who 
      surrendered were driven off to an undisclosed destination. On 17th June, 
      the papers quoted Ranaweera, a policemen who escaped with injuries, saying 
      that he and 113 of his colleagues from Kalmunai police station were lined 
      up and shot. The fact the there was resistance in Kalmunai together with 
      Tiger casualties may have influenced the inexcusable conduct of the Tigers. 
      This in turn would have influenced the conduct of the army when it re-occupied 
      Kalmunai.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">On two occasions, 13th and 16th June, ceasefires 
      were agreed to between the LTTE and the government's negotiator, justice 
      minister A.C.S.Hameed. Both these broke down shortly.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">The Island of 16th June reported quoting informed 
      sources that 100 Tigers were killed in Trincomalee when the armed forces 
      counter attacked. It failed to add that the tigers were not around during 
      the counter attack.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">On the 16th June, the press also reported a press 
      conference given by Minister M.H.Mohamed at his parliament office. The 
      Minister charged the Israeli experts had joined the LTTE to create trouble 
      and turmoil. The paper did not report any significant evidence. Why this 

      influential minister and Senior member of the UNP should raise it at this 
      time was not clear. The Minister is a leading member of the Sri Lanka Arab 
      Friendship society. There was hardly any response to the minister from 
      other members of the government, expect what appeared to be an embarrased 
      silence.The aother parlimentarian who has charged that the Israelis are 
      helping the tigers is Vasudeva Nanayakkara from the left end of the political 
      spectrum. If there is substance to this charge, what is likely is that 
      the Israelis started helping the Tigers about the time President Premadasa 
      began talks with them in April 1989. Such help would then have been in 
      concord with the government's own policy of with the US policy of arming 
      and strengthening them. It would also have been in keeping with the US policy 
      of containing Indian influence. The Israeli Interests Section housed in 
      the US Embassy premises was brought in during 1984 as part of US efforts 
      to help the government find a military solution on the Tamil problem, as 
      against India's aims. The government had the Israeli Interests Section 
      withdrawn earlier this year about the time of the withdrawal of the IPKF. 
      this was reportedly due to Islamic pressure. It would have seemed like 
      getting rid of an awkward ally, while denying him the political price he 
      wanted in return. The United State had conveyed its displeasure at this 
      action.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">The sunday Observer of 17th June quoted, President 
      Premadasa as having said in a speech,the Tigers would face the JVP's fate. 
      The same issue in its leading item, filed by a special correspondent from 
      London, claimed that LTTE's strategists had met in London to draw up a master-plan 
      to destabilise Sri Lanka. Kittu was listed as one of the strategists who 
      participated. The plan was obviously an invention on the Observer's part 
      to create war hysteria. According to this plan journalists were not to 
      be encouraged to visit those parts where the LTTE had gone into action. 
      Anyone who knows the LTTE should know that they are far more sophisticated 
      at using the media. Where there had been action there would be reprisals 
      against civilians to report.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">On 23rd June President Premadasa opened the grand 
      "Gam Udawa 90" exhibition at Pallekele near Kandy. this brief flash of 
      royal splendor coincided with the President's birth day. It also had a 
      chilling side to it. during the recent upsurge of activity by the JVP, 
      the Pallekele army camp had been successfully raided. In reprisals late 
      last year, the security forces had killed and burnt a large number of villagers. 
      15,000 security forces personnel were tied up in providing security for 
      the exhibition. This is said to be one reason why any major military initiative 
      in the North was delayed until July.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">While the government was using the killing of surrendered 
      policemen by the tigers to claim the moral high ground, it was itself quietly 
      doing something sinister and reprehensible. Shortly after the conflict 
      began, a large number of burning bodies started appearing in the south. 
      Mr. Lakshman Kiriella, S.L.F.P. MP for the Kandy district told a meeting 
      of his party M.P's that 40 bodies a day were appearing by the road sides 
      in the Kandy district. A southern University source said that 27 bodies 
      appeared by the road side at Kuliyapitiya. Other locals have said that 
      civilians had been seen inside the local army camp. these bodies are believed 
      to be those of JVP suspects held at unofficial detention centres, not registered 
      with the ICRC. These were apparently being cleared in preparation for moving 
      army units to the North-East. This says something about the nature of the 
      army that was being sent to wage a moral war in the North-East.</font> <a href="#a">[Top]</a><br>
