      <b><font color="#990000">TAMILS IN THE SOUTH:</font></b><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000"><font size=+2>F</font>ollowing the arrival of the 
      IPKF in 1987, the Tamils were treated in the South with consideration by 
      the security forces. More than any change of heart the reason was that 
      India had used the treatment of the Tamils between July 1983 and July 1987 
      to legitimise its presence in this country. This conclusion is suggested 
      by their current conduct. This continued until shortly after the LTTE began 
      talks with the government. The undermining of the EPRLF led provincial 
      government to which the government was morally and legally committed became 
      the common aim of both the LTTE and the government. The government forces 
      still did not touch Tamils. This was left to the LTTE which was given facilities 
      and Pajero Jeeps.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">The process was at first subtle. The LTTE set 
      up check points at Nochchiyagama and Manampitiya close Sri Lankan police 
      stations, to monitor Jaffna bound vehicles and Batticaloa bound vehicles 
      respectively. A new phenomenon observed in STF searches in the South for 
      JVP suspects was the appearance of Tamil persons on some of these search 
      parties, speaking Jaffna Tamil and knowing lanes and faces in Jaffna. This 
      has been reported by Tamils who had come across these parties in Colombo 
      and in the Kandy district. A typical case is that of a Tamil who was caught 
      in an STF search in Teldeniya [near Pallekele] after which several dead 
      bodies were found. As soon as he identified himself a Tamil, another member 
      of the party was directed to him. This was a young Tamil person who after 
      questioning his whereabouts in Jaffna identified him as the brother of a 
      person who was in a dissident militant group.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">About the time IPKF commenced its withdrawal, arrests 
      in the South by the LTTE became more open. The Sri Lankan police too harassed 
      members of militant groups opposed to the LTTE who started arriving in Colombo 
      to seek safety. The LTTE even seemed free to move about the Colombo airport 
      premises pick up persons. About November an EPRLF member was picked off 
      an Air India flight which was in the process of departing.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">The murders of Tamil MP's Amirthalingam, Yogeswaran 
      and Sam Tambimuttu were committed in Colombo while the LTTE enjoyed this 
      freedom of movement. The LTTE has admitted the first two killings. responsibility 
      has not been fixed for the third. The Sri Lankan authorities had little 
      to say on these killings.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">Following the withdrawal of the IPKF to the Jaffna 
      peninsula, arrests by the LTTE in Colombo became more blatant. A typical 
      case is that of Michael, who was a member of the EPRLF more than six years 
      ago and was now working at a plantain shop in Colombo. Those arrested like 
      Michael were handcuffed to the seats of passenger vans plying between Colombo 
      and Jaffna in the nights. The van upon leaving Colombo would go past Sri 
      Lankan police and army check points with the chained prisoners, who would 
      remain seated when the others got down to be checked. Upon reaching Paranthan 
      about 3.00 A.M., LTTE cadre who had been informed by radio would meet the 
      van and transport the prisoners to Mullaitivu in a pick up van.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">The first time large numbers of Tamil youths were 
      arrested in Colombo was when the Defence Minister Ranjan Wijeratne announced 
      in mid-February that the Indian agency, the RAW, had plans to destabilise 
      Colombo. The plan, if ever there was one, did not materialise and the IPKF 
      departed quietly by March end.</font><b><font color="#990000"></font></b> 
    <p><font color="#990000"><b>THE PRESENT:</b> The next large scale arrests 
      of Tamil youth in the South took place after the commencement of hostilities 
      between the LTTE and the government on 11th June. The numbers detained 
      in Colombo ran into hundreds. Significant numbers of Tamil youth were reported 
      missing in the South. A human rights official in the South said that he 
      had been approached in the cases of about 40 Tamils detained in Colombo, 
      7 of them, he said, could not be traced. Two young assistant lectures in 
      Engineering at Peradeniya University went missing about the end of June. 
      Both were Tamils from Batticaloa. They had finished dinner at Leon's restaurant, 
      Kandy about 10.00 p.m. and left for their quarters on Lady Hill, on a motor 
      cycle.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">Seven engineering students from Jaffna on their 
      way to sit for their examination at the University of Peradeniya went missing 
      on 16th July. The following is taken from `the Virakesari' of 23rd July:</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">3rd year engineering students S. Dayanandarajah, 
      B.N. Robinson, K. Anandarajah, K. Ramesh, S. Senthilrajan; and second 
      year engineering students Suthakar and Thillainathan; all from Jaffna, 
      arrived in Vavuniya on 16th July. From there they were helped to reach 
      Anuradhapura by Rev. Croos of Vavuniya. From there they boarded a CTB bus 
      for Peradeniya. They were arrested at the Dambulla Police check point. 
      The Police instructed the bus driver to hand over the students at the Revula 
      police station the driver first went to this police station and handed 
      over the students before proceeding. Prof. C.L.V. Jayatilleke, the Vice 
      Chancellor of Peradeniya was informed of this the following day. The I.G.P. 
      and D.I.G. [Central Province] have also been informed of this. The O.I.C. 
      Dambulla Police has denied the incident.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">Another report said that 50 engineering students 
      from Jaffna who went to Peradeniya by train on the same day, changing at 
      Polgahawela, were badly assaulted by the police at Kadugannawa. The policeman 
      who did the assaulting had taken care to hide his number.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">In the incident where the 7 students were detained, 
      the incident had been reported by another student whose presence in the 
      bus had gone unobserved. He had seen the 7 students being taken over by 
      the army. The `Virakesari' of 27th July said that upon being told of this 
      matter, Mrs. Pulendran, the State Minister for Education, had made inquiries 
      and was now assured by the authorities that the students were in their custody. 
      It is a general fear that unless the detainee has someone influential to 
      raise the matter immediately, the worst might happen.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">It is notable that the incident was not reported 
      in the English press. Concerned persons in the universities became aware 
      of it through hearsay. In Peradeniya itself, the staff unions were slow 
      to move and it is likely that some of them were not even told. The Tamil 
      students themselves appeared to lack the confidence that the staff would 
      be interested. To understand this state of affairs, it must be remembered 
      that the southern universities themselves went thorugh a period of terror 
      last year when a large number of Sinhalese students went missing. A fear 
      of informants, perhaps imagined, was so great that it was considered too 
      dangerous to speak or to make inquiries about missing students. The subject 
      itself was deemed unwelcome. A casual remark like `I heard that the CID 
      was making inquiries about him', would appear to settle the issue of a missing 
      student.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">A lady on the staff of Peradeniya University said: 
      "The reason why the staff unions did not promptly take up the matter of 
      the missing Tamil students is not racial. It is a hangover from our terrible 
      experiences last year. Kandy was rife with killings. I went out on a morning 
      and found 4 bodies at the top of the road. There was one tied to a lamp 
      post. I actually went near to examine if it was alive. It was dead. I 
      went to the nearest police station and told policemen that were bodies on 
      the road. He simply grinned. I heard that there were 4 more bodies at 
      the other end of the road. The incident followed the killing of a soldier. 
      The either bodies were those of innocent local villagers. One had been 
      a deaf mute. A colleague of mine who lived down Heerasagala road said that 
      to them these were regular experiences. A student of mine told me that 
      one night there was a single shot. People stayed inside. He heard later 
      that the father of a policeman had been killed. Sinhalese students were 
      then living in fear. A number of innocent students who had reason to believe 
      that they were being watched, had to sleep in different places. I know 
      that a total of 9 students are missing from two of my batches. Such occurrences 
      came to be accepted as normal and not requiring an energetic response.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">"It is not true that the staff are indifferent to 
      the matter of missing Tamil students. These are not times when appeals 
      to principles and justice bring a response. But the staff are sensitive 
      when told: "Look, this war broke out and the Tamil people started questioning 
      the Tigers and began to distance themselves from them. By subjecting Tamil 
      students to this kind of treatment, you are going to drive the whole community 
      back into the arms of the Tigers." An appeal to self interest does work."</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">Nothing definite has been heard regarding the two 
      missing Tamil assistant lectures. University sources said that it was unusual 
      for people to be stopped on the Kandy-Peradeniya road and that there have 
      been indications that the pick up was planned.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">All universities in this country face a number of 
      common problems, but it is difficult to make judgement. The constraints 
      are different. During the JVP troubles, Ruhuna University in the south 
      was almost totally silenced. The IPKF's cosmetic attempts at maintaining 
      normality, provided a little space for democratic activity by the students 

      and staff at Jaffna University and for raising issues concerning the interests 
      of the community. The experience under the LTTE was different. The next 
      phase is uncertain.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">Other incidents : In almost all current cases 
      of violence against Tamils in the South, those responsible are persons in 
      uniform. the scale may be small in comparison with the past. Unlike the 
      blatant violence of 1983, the current violence in the South is secretive 
      and is carefully kept out of the press.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">Gal Oya, 21st June : The Colombo bound train 
      from Batticaloa left early on the 11th June and was stopped at Gal Oya when 
      news of trouble broke out. The Head Guard was M. Yogirajah (47) of Sandililpay. 
      The Batticaloa bound train from Colombo, with Head Guard M. Marcilyn (50) 
      of Batticaloa was also stopped in Gal Oya. The two Head Guards with their 
      Under Guards, Dharmalingam (35) from Jaffna and Iruthaya-Nathan (38) from 
      Batticaloa decided to put up at the Running Bungalow at Gal Oya station.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">Yogirajah went to Colombo on 18th June to see his 
      brother Shanmugasundaram who worked in President Premadasa's Ministry of 
      Housing. He returned to Gal Oya on 20th June because of the uncertain security 
      situation in Colombo. The police had reoccupied the army camp at Hathoroskotuwa 
      after the outbreak of the war. The army had abandoned it in 1987. On the 
      afternoon of the 21st, some of these policemen had come to Gal Oya station 
      and had made inquiries about Tamils. It appears that an employee had given 
      the names of the 4 guards.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">The policemen returned at 8.30 p.m. and ordered 
      the station master, a Sinhalese, to lead them to the Running Bungalow. 
      After a short distance they started climbing the steps leading to the bungalow, 
      which was on an elevation. The police ordered the station master to wait 
      and went inside. Yogarajah was having his dinner and a number of railway 
      men were chatting inside. The police ordered the Tamil guards to come with 
      their bags for questioning. The railwaymen who had identified themselves 
      as Sinhalese and Muslims protested, saying that the Tamils were friends 
      and were well known to them. The policemen remained adamant. Yogirajah 
      wanted to collect the flags which were part of a guard's baggage. The police 
      said that, that was not necessary. The policemen descended on the side 
      of the elevation visible from the village, after warning the station master 
      not to let slip a word about their visit. That 4 prisoners were taken by 
      the police is known in the village. Gun shots were heard at 5.00 a.m. the 
      following day.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">One sinhalese guard ventured out or a bicycle that 
      morning and 3/4 a mile on the Trincomalee road, at a petrol shop, came across 
      4 bodies burning inside a tractor tire. Villagers told him that the police 
      had warned them not to hang around. He quickly returned without trying 
      to identify the bodies. What remained was burnt by villagers in the jungle.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">Nothing more was heard of the missing guards. Senior 
      Superintendent of Police, Kanagaratnam of Batticaloa who was a close relative 
      of one of the guards, moved hard in the matter. An inquiry was held at 
      Habarana and statements were taken. It is learnt that some salient points 
      were with held in making these statements. It may be noted that railwaymen 
      are not without influence. They were concerned for their colleagues, had 
      communication facilities and had 8 hours in which to act. But nothing was 
      apparently done. That gives some indication of the state of fear.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">Maradana, 15th July: A young Tamil youth from 
      Valaichenai was met at Maradana Railway Station by an elderly railway employee. 
      Both boarded a private bus outside and bought their tickets. A young man 
      with a Muslim cap came in and asked the young boy in Tamil to come outside 
      for a chat. The young Tamil refused. Another man standing outside, who 
      appeared to be a policemen, bellowed in sinhalese, "Get down Yakko". The 
      railway employee got down with the young Tamil and was told that he was 
      not needed. At the young man was marched, the railway employee insisted 
      on following him. The man in the Muslim cap marched the Tamil into the 
      community hall opposite Buhari restaurant. A police truck was parked near 
      by. As the Tamil youth went inside, he saw 15 to 20 others similarly detained. 
      Another Muslim youth came forward and told the young man who had brought 
      him, "I know him. He is from Valaichenai. Let him go".</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">The Tamil youth later told the railway employee, 
      that both the persons whom he had met were SLMC activists from Valaichenai. 
      There have been widespread reports that the government was using SLMC activists 
      and Tamil militants from other groups against Tigers. This appears to be 
      a reversal of roles on the government's part. What happened to the 15-20 
      youths is not known.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">Welikanda, 18th June: The army shot and burnt 
      Mr.Pathmanathan, a Tamil police constable. Pathmanathan used to be on duty 
      at the Welikanda railway station.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">Between Madawachchiya and Anuradhapura, 22nd July 
      Tamil passengers to Colombo, coming from Jaffna boarded the train at Madawachchiya. 
      Some men who were dressed in trousers or shorts and T.shirts, came into 
      a railway carriage. It is thought that they were not ordinary civilians. 
      They selected four young Tamil men and asked them to come to the corridor 
      for a discussion. At a point where the train was moving fast, passengers 
      saw the 4 young Tamils being pushed out. What became of them is not known. 
      Rumours of such incidents have spread a general fear amongst Tamils wanting 
      to travel between Jaffna and Colombo.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">The full extent of violence against Tamils in the 
      South is not known and is not talked about. Independent contact with border 
      areas is difficult. Scanty information often comes through friendly Muslim 
      traders.</font><a href="#top">[Top]</a>
