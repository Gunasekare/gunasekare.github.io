    <b><font color="#990000">(i) Killings of Sinhalese civilians:</font></b><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000"><font size=+2>T</font>he first reports of killings 
      of Sinhalese civilians by the LTTE during this war appeared in the press 
      on 25th July. The number killed along border areas was put at 37 by the 
      Island of 27th July. 20 had been killed in Medawachchi, including women 
      and children. These killings together with past killings of Sinhalese civilians 
      represent the darker side of Tamil nationalism. It also represents the 
      fatal inability of the dominant Tamil politics to put forward a line to 
      the Sinhalese that expresses respect and concern. Quite often in the past 
      the dominant Tamil forces had restored to massacres of Sinhalese civilians 
      in a bid to escalate the conflict, whenever it was politically cornered. 
      Example are April `87 and October `87. In the first instance the state 
      characteristically responded with punitive aerial bombardment and shelling 
      in Jaffna, thus setting the stage for the Indian intervention.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">We must also look at how the state has handled the 
      problem. Throughout the whole year that it had been talking to the LTTE, 
      from April `89, it practically used the LTTE as hit men to destroy other 
      Tamil groups and to embarrass India. Moreover the government's dealings 
      with the LTTE came at a time when it was at a low ebb and was down to killing 
      civil servants and citizen activists who were making life for people a little 
      more tolerable. Instead making the LTTE question its politics, the government 
      used it. Give its own treatment of the Sinhalese, the government was morally 
      unfit to influence the LTTE for the better.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">To place the matter in context, there have been 
      many mature Tamil militant leaders, who despite massacres of Tamils by state 
      forces [1983-86] and their own personal encounters with the state, held 
      a strong political line against killing Sinhalese civilians. There were 
      at least two major militant groups who had not indulged in this activity. 
      But the attitudes of the Sri Lankan state and the historical process enveloping 
      events tended to give prestige to mindless extremism on both sides. Those 
      with coherent political ideas fell by the wayside, often in despair.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">Killings of Sinhalese and Muslim civilians do mark 
      some of the most shameful episodes in Tamil history. In coming to terms 
      with it, it must be recognised that it is not the young who are principally 
      to blame. Many young, despite their experience have made a conscious and 
      successful effort to see or begin to see, Sinhalese as their people. At 
      the same time, these unspeakable acts are condoned or looked at indifferently 
      in some of the highest circles.</font> <br>
      <font color="#990000"></font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><b><font color="#990000">(ii) The Muslim Question</font></b><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">The question has its origins in the downgrading 
      of democratic principles as say reflected in the charter of human rights 
      and determining political influence through a crude ballot box system. 
      In this system being a member of a minority was a server disadvantage. 
      And each community watched the birth-rates of other communities with suspicious 
      eyes. The most influential Tamil community, the Ceylon Tamils form 12 1/2% 
      of the population, Hill country Tamils 5 1/2% and Muslims who are largely 
      Tamil speaking form 7 1/2% of the population. An old dream of several Tamil 
      politicians was to unite these three communities into an influential minority 
      bloc. But the main Sinhalese parties have without too much effort, kept 
      them divided. The CWC which represents the Hill Country Tamils has given 
      crucial support to the ruling UNP, even though its own constituency were 
      victims of race riots. Apart from geographical factors, the three communities 
      had historically divergent interests. Similar problems existed for a single 
      Muslim bloc, controlled by a Colombo based Muslim elite.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">The muslim in the East who were a large community 
      living alongside Tamils there, for some time into the 60's elected a number 
      of candidates from the Tamil led Federal Party. But subsequently Muslims 
      here came to be represented by the two national parties, the SLFP and the 
      UNP. In 1984, the state set up agents to foment communal violence between 
      Tamils and Muslims in the East as a means of combating the Tamil insurgency.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">Having gone through this history, there developed 
      a strong feeling amongst Eastern Muslims that their interest could not be 
      articulated through any Tamil party or by the two national parties catering 
      mainly to a Sinhalese electorate. This was how the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress 
      (SLMS), having its base in the East came into being in the mid 80's. This 
      annoyed not only the Tamil political groups, but also the Colombo based 
      Muslim leadership and the national parties who had garnered seats in the 
      East.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">The Tamil parties, most of all the LTTE, regarded 
      the SLMC as creating disunity within the Tamil nation. But this was a short 
      sighted view. The SLMC was to be a party rooted in the East and represented 
      by local people who had reason to try to secure good neighbourly relations 
      with Tamils with whom they had to live and be sensitive to their sentiments. 
      They need not be pawns moved by an elite leadership in Colombo. In this 
      sense the SLMC was beneficial to the Tamils. The provincial council elections 
      in 1988 and the general elections of 1989 proved that the SLMC did indeed 
      have a secure base in the East. In fairness the SLMC it showed a willingness 
      to reach accommodation with the Tamils in the context of a North-East provincial 
      council adequate autonomy for Muslims areas.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">The LTTE hostility to the SLMC was ideological in 
      that it claimed to be the sole legitimate representative of all Tamil speaking 
      people in the North-East. The TULF and the EPRLF led provincial administration, 
      at the higher levels, saw the need to reach accommodation with the SLMC 
      and talks were held. But at militant cadre level, antagonism remained. 
      Some of it was based on old prejudices and some of it, the legacy of communal 
      violence in 1984. However, different militant group had their own dealings 
      with different Muslims villages and relations were often smooth. But the 
      general attitude towards Muslims was in the manner of a military force towards 
      the population within its area of influence. This showed through in the 
      events following July 1987.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">Muslims suffered repeatedly at the hands of Tamil 
      militant groups. Any sign of self assertion by the Muslims was deemed a 
      provocative act. On 3rd September `87, Mr. Habib Mohamed, the AGA of Mutur 
      was killed. A protest hartal by Muslims in Kalmunai a week later ended 
      with looting and burning of Muslim shops by Tamil militants. In May 1989, 
      the bodies of a few Muslim farmers who had been kidnapped for ransom were 
      dug up. Subsequent violence resulted in refugees on both sides. An IPKF 
      convoy carrying food for refugees was fired at. Both Tamil and Muslim sources 
      identified the persons who did the firing as off-duty Muslim policemen. 
      Both sides have also alleged, possible instigation from higher up. There 
      followed an orgy of looting and burning in Samanthurai by Tamil militants 
      allied to the IPKF.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">A finger has often been pointed at the Muslim Jihad. 
      This was a vigilante group whose formation in 1984 was encouraged by the 
      Sri Lankan state. This was never a large organisation and there were probably 
      more Muslims in Tamil militant groups. About 7 members of the Muslim jihad 
      were killed in Samanthurai while doing sentry duty around Muslim areas during 
      the disturbances. Their weapons were nothing more sophisticated than shot 
      guns. The Jihad was never intended to be a serious military force.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">By November, the IPKF had pulled out of the southern 
      sector of the Eastern province, leaving the Tamil National Army, the conscript 
      army of mostly unwilling youngsters it had armed, to defend for themselves. 
      The TNA killed a number of Muslims and on 17th November the TNA massacred 
      40 Muslim policemen and members of the CVF [the provincial police trained 
      by the IPFK with the consent of the government] from Samanthurai, Nintavur 
      and Sainthamathuru. The TNA consisted of panic stricken youngsters confronted 
      with the LTTE and the Sri Lanka forces who were advancing. It has been 
      claimed that they received `advice' to stir up trouble so as to obtain IPKF 
      support.</font> <br>
      <font color="#990000"></font> <br>
      <font color="#990000">Once in control, the LTTE banned the SLMC and pressurised 
      leading Muslims to join its political party, the PFLT. Stirring of protest 
      was met with intimidation and strong arm measures. The violence to which 
      the LTTE resorted against Muslim policemen and civilians after the June 
      war broke out, suggest that the LTTE was resentful that its methods were 
      not succeeding.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">The government's indifference to complaints by the 
      SLMC when it was close to the LTTE, coupled often with remarks of disrespect, 
      suggest that Muslim self-assertion in the East was as unwelcome to the government 
      as it was to Tamil groups. This puts the Muslims in an unenviable situation.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">The manner in which Tamils have mishandled their 
      relations with Muslims, parallels that in which Sinhalese have done theirs 
      with Tamils. It is for the Tamils to make a decisive gesture of reconciliation. 
      The Muslims and the Tamils in the East have to live together. Whatever 
      autonomy the Muslims want is best conceded ungrudgingly. The Muslims have 
      had a difficult time in finding a political direction to articulate their 
      interests. Many, to whom a patronising view of Muslims comes naturally 
      have treated this as a subject of uncharitable humour. Muslim distrust 
      of Tamils goes back a very long time and Tamils need to work very hard to 
      overcome that.The late justice Hussein, an Eastern Province Muslim, once 
      told a Tamil friend: " You people do not question the legacy of Tamil leaders 
      like Sir P.Ramanathan. During the Sinhalese-Muslim riots of 1915 Ramanathan 
      went all the way to England braving German torpedo boats, to plead the case 
      of the Sinhalese with the colonial power. He did not have one word to say 
      for the Muslim victims." Having gone through recent experiences, the feelings 
      of eastern Muslims as a distinct community would have been strengthened. 
      Not to respect this will open the way to further tragedies.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">The problem comes back to the question of democracy. 
      We need a politics that stresses principles rather than numbers, where it 
      is no longer a disability to be a minority community.</font> <br>

    <p><b><font color="#990000">(iii) The International committee of the Red 
      Cross</font></b><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">In the current war, the ICRC is playing a role in 
      a situation that had been anticipated. The demands made on it soon exceeded 
      what it had been prepared for. It has helped in carrying foodstuffs and 
      medicines to people cut off by war and in maintaining communications. Its 
      rules oblige it to act observing confidentiality with the full consent of 
      both sides. It can report breaches to the parties concerned, but cannot 
      expose them publicly. The ICRC is ideally suited to play a role in what 
      is called `humanising' a war, when a war is fought by conventional armies 
      with recognisable areas of control. In such a war humanitarian services 
      include looking after the interests of prisoners of war.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">While gratefully acknowledging the services of the 
      ICRC, it is also proper to examine its limitations. This concerns the main 
      purpose for which the ICRC was brought into this country. The ICRC was 
      brought in at the height of the JVP's insurgency in late September 1989, 
      when the government's human rights record came under international condemnation. 
      Many southern human rights activists charge that the ICRC's role in this 
      context served the purposes of the government rather than the interests 
      of detainees. The time at which the ICRC was invited in just preceded the 
      Sri Lanka aid group meeting in early October 1989. Though the coming of 
      the ICRC raised hopes, nothing notable happened for several months. Bodies 
      continued to appear by the roadside.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">Eventually, the ICRC did monitor the 12 or so official 
      detention centers including the big one at Boosa. According to these sources, 
      there were many detainees being held at unofficial detention centers some 
      of them sited within security forces camps and some were private houses. 
      The problem arose with these. When the June war began, these centers had 
      to be cleared to move the forces to the combat Zone. Having told the world 
      that it was now treating prisoners lawfully even to the point of opening 
      its doors to ICRC monitoring, the government now had a problem in acknowledging 
      the existence of other detainees. They associated this problem with the 
      appearance in the South of a large number of burning bodies during the early 
      weeks of the war. The ICRC, they say, is painfully aware of this problem, 
      but must remain silent. If there had been no ICRC monitoring, they say, 
      many of these prisoners at the unofficial centers may have been simply dumped 
      at the regular ones. The relatives of many detainees who banked much on 
      the ICRC have been left feeling bitter.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">With the problem of Tamil detainees coming up, these 
      activists have concluded that in this situation the monitoring is best done 
      by persons or organisations who are not inhibited from acting on any information 
      and publicising their findings. While the government accepted an ICRC role, 
      it has shown itself wildly hostile to the Amnesty International.</font>

    <p><b><font color="#990000">(iv) The Tamil Militant Groups opposed to the 
      LTTE</font></b><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">These groups have gone through a history of downgrading 
      of their political outlook through militarisation, decimation by the LTTE, 
      being used by India against the LTTE, alienation from the people and often 
      brutalisation. Thus even the EPRLF which kept up a democratic structure 
      as late as 1986 and staved off the kind of internal killings for which some 
      groups became notorious, gave way to some bouts of irrational frenzy against 
      ordinary people when in service of the IPKF. Other disabilities suffered 
      by these groups came from some of their able leaders being systematically 
      targeted and from a loss of a number of their politically sensitive cadre 
      in the process of militarisation. As examples of the first we have the 
      killings of Sundaram of the PLOTE and LTTE associates Iraikumaran & Umaikumaran 
      in 1982, Mano Master of the TELO in 1984 and recently the killings of 13 
      senior EPRLF leaders in Madras on 19th June 1990.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">Whenever state powers or agencies wanted to use 
      any militant group, they tried to use them not as political organisation 
      but as hit squads. Thus the Sri Lankan government which first used the 
      LTTE against these groups would like to reverse the roles, now that it is 
      at war with the LTTE. When the war broke, their first reaction was based 
      on their antagonism towards the LTTE. Again, people became very concerned 
      that these groups had almost nothing to say on the sufferings of Tamil civilians. 
      This state of affairs did not last long. Many of them indicated privately 
      that they were sensitive to civilian sentiments. A number of their MPs 
      did make private representations to the authorities. The first detailed 
      public statement was made in Parliament by an EPRLF member on 19th July. 
      These groups started meeting in Colombo with the aim of adopting a common 
      stand.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">These groups also faced an acute dilemma in asserting 
      their independence of the Sri Lankan state. India had finished with them. 
      If they went to the North-East, they would be at the mercy of the LTTE or 
      the Sri Lankan forces. It was difficult for them to stay in the South and 
      oppose the government. They were being given reminders that their help 
      in tracking down the Tigers would be welcome. The killing of 15 PLOTE members 
      in Kalmunai by `unidentified persons' appeared to carry a message. One 
      group sent 8 of its cadre to work with the Sri Lankan forces in Batticaloa. 
      Two of them who were brought back to Colombo on their own insistence said 
      that they could not stomach the terrible sight of Tamils being killed. 
      Another group reportedly sent 25 of its cadre to operate with the state 
      forces in Trincomalee, saying that their presence may help to soften the 
      treatment of Tamil civilians.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">The only creative way out for them is to put principles 
      first and come out with the whole truth publicly. Those who wish to lead 
      must first earn the peoples' trust. They have once mismanaged their relations 
      with the people. They can hardly afford to do it again.</font><b><font color="#990000"></font></b> 
    <p><b><font color="#990000">(v) The Salient Features of the Current War:</font></b><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">We mention these points about the war because they 
      are intimately concerned with prospects for human rights in this country. 
      A senior general in the Sri Lankan Army has stated that the aim of the Army 
      is to gain the upper hand before a political solution is talked about. 
      This means that until victory is in sight, it is the military aims that 
      will be talked about, while a silence is maintained on the political settlement. 
      For the Tamils the first causes resentment and the second suspicion. Thus 
      both these confer legitimacy to the notion that the government cannot be 
      trusted and must be confronted militarily. As the war becomes vicious 
      with heavy causalities among the forces and civilians, the inhibition against 
      killing Tamil civilians decreases sharply. In turn, this makes the state's 
      propaganda a patently one sided whitewashing affair. Tamil opinion is driven 
      to feel angry and cornered, irrespective of whether or not they approve 
      of the Tigers. With no newspapers and no communication with the outside, 
      except government radio broadcasts and the vague hopes created by broadcasts 
      from Tamil Nadu, people are fed on stories of atrocities by state forces 
      carried by refugees. In their own experience this is confirmed by shelling 
      and aerial attacks which appear purely vindictive. While generous dispatches 
      of food and medicine are announced in Colombo, hardly anything is seen to 
      arrive in the war zone. Patients have to be denied treatment for even routine 
      ailments like dog bite and tetanus. Without facilities for medical care, 
      needless amputations have to be performed on those with shell injuries caused 
      by the state. Children are amongst the worst sufferers. All this is seen 
      to be caused deliberately. The young begin to feel that once the state 
      forces come in, they will be killed. Even those with no love for the current 
      militant cause begin feel that they are left with no alternative.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">The militant force through years of experience is 
      geared to take full advantage of every weakness of the state, particularly 
      its unconcern for civilians. The state's often punitive reactions to its 
      killing of Sinhalese civilians strengthens its image as the defender of 
      the Tamil people.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">The government forces have paid in heavy causalities 
      to take control of heavily mined and fortified population centers. The 
      Tigers then retreated to jungle sanctuaries where they had built up facilities 
      during the last few months. The spate of disappearances in areas under 
      the control of the state forces, help the spread of fear among the young.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">Earlier government boasts about smashing the Tigers 
      and having a quick decision have given way to more sanguinary expectations 
      Casualty figures in 1 1/2 months have climbed to a figure comparable with 
      the 600-700 figure during the campaign of 1984-87. Air support is deemed 
      grossly inadequate to cover co-ordinate guerilla attacked in places far 
      apart. Many more naval craft are thought necessary to cover guerilla transportation 
      routes along the coast and across the Palk Straits. [See The Drive for 
      the North can be Costly' - Rohan Gunasekara, Sunday Island, 29th July]. 
      There are also moves to increase the current military strength of 50,000. 
      The financial and technological requirements of both sides are well beyond 
      the resources of this poor country. This means that the conflict has been 
      effectively internationalised. But the social cost must be paid for here.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">Given the Southern mental and political framework 
      from which this war is conducted, creeping disillusionment often leads to 
      an uncritical admiration of the dominant Tamil group, further legitimising 
      its role. It is deemed to speak for all Tamils. We saw this actually happening 
      in 1986-87 and in 1989. Even liberal sections in the South tended to become 
      impatient with any suggestion that human rights violations by this group 
      against civilians deserved serious concern. The tragedies faced by this 
      country during the last few years are the result of this lack of principle.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">Just as the government has to come to terms with 
      its limitations, the Tigers too have theirs. The Tamils are a small disillusioned 
      community, lacking the ability to provide man power for a prolonged conflict. 
      Their material capacity to assert independence is very limited. They must 
      depend on the state for food, medicines, electricity, banking salaries etc. 
      The prospects of social collapse and exhaustion are very real. The militants 
      seem to have banked on a couple of quick sensational victories, such as 
      the capture of Jaffna Fort and do not appear to be happy with the way things 
      went. As things progress with no end in sight, it is natural for ordinary 
      people to plead for a reprieve from endless suffering. This is often met 
      with coldness and anger.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">A qualitative change for the better can be brought 
      into this conflict only if the state spells out first a reasonable political 
      solution and goes on to give the Tamil people confidence that no harm will 
      come to them. Not only will the conduct of the forces have to change, but 
      tangible guarantees for the safety of the young must be given. Not to do 
      this will be to live through old tragedies once more.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><b><font color="#990000">(vi) The Victimisation of Non-Combatant Civilians</font></b><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">The prime example of this was the 1983 race-riots 
      against Tamils and the military campaign conducted by the state during the 
      succeeding years. A large number of Tamil civilians were also killed during 
      the IPKF campaigns lasting 2 years from October 1987.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">The first and most sensational killing of Sinhalese 
      civilians was the LTTE's Anuradhapura massacre in May 1985. This was regarded 
      a reprisal for the blasting of 70 Tamil civilians by the army in Valvettithurai 
      a few days earlier. Following the Anuradhapura massacre, the Sri Lankan 
      Navy killed passengers in the boat Kumudhini off Jaffna. In the latter 
      as in the Anuradhapura massacre, women and infants were among the victims. 
      According to militant sources, many of the participants in the Anuradhapura 
      massacre kept having nightmares and formed habits of addiction to forms 
      of stimuli. These set the pattern for future massacres. Apart from reprisals 
      being a motive for massacres, the state wanted to diminish Tamil claims 
      to territory in the Trincomalee and Vavuniya districts. Equally, Tamil 
      militants wanted to make Sinhalese settlements unconducive. Many Tamil 
      civilians were also killed by militant groups.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">The massacre of Sinhalese civilians in the East 
      on 5th October 1987, had the distinction that many of the victims were long 
      term Sinhalese residents having good relations with Tamils. It is reported 
      that the area leader in Batticaloa, who was a native of the place, was unhappy 
      with the instructions.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">When pro-Indian groups operated under the IPKF, 
      many of the civilian victims were unarmed supporters of the LTTE or citizens' 
      committee members close to the LTTE. During the same period [1988,89], 
      the LTTE's victims were often those having contact with the IPKF, civil 
      administrators and activists and politicians whom it regarded a political 
      threat. Up to the end of this time, family members of persons regarded 
      as enemies for some reason or the other were generally spared. A noticeable 
      qualitative change came with the IPKF withdrawal. Thousands of persons 
      related to members of pro-Indian groups wanted to flee the country. The 
      majority of these civilians were from areas outside Jaffna. The hunt for 
      them was helped by the Sri Lankan navy as they attempted to flee to India 
      in boats. Two boat loads of refugees were reportedly sunk by the Sri Lankan 
      navy off Mannar. A number of refugee families captured at sea were reportedly 
      killed on land, in places such as the cremation grounds at Vathiri. Even 
      loyal LTTE supporters expressed shock.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">In the course of the current war Sri Lankan forces 
      have killed a large number of non-combatant civilians. The motive behind 
      the disappearance of the Kalmunai citizens' committee leader appears to 
      be that of suppression of information on activities of the forces. Killings 
      of Muslim civilians have been reported in the press. A small minority of 
      the victims were Muslims associated with the LTTE. At this point it is 
      not possible to say what proportion of the Muslim victims were political 
      activists, ordinary civilians or relatives of Jihad members. The `Sun' 
      of 3rd August reported that the LTTE had killed the father and the son of 
      a Muslim homeguard in Majeedpur, Samanthurai. A number of Tamils have also 
      been reportedly abducted by Muslim homeguards.</font> <a href="#top">[Top]</a>
