    <p><br>
      <b><font color="#990000"><a href="/uthrj/Misalaneous/nssp">The NSSP </a>:</font></b><font color="#990000"> 
      What follows is a statement by Mr. Vasudeva Nanayakkara NSSP Politbureau 
      member and NP (Sunday Observer 1st July).</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">He described LTTE as a fascist force which would 
      brook no dissent. He further said, "They came to an understanding with 
      this reactionary government. They seem to fit into one another well. But 
      even they had to fall out. Both had the Israelis as their collaborators 
      and well wishers.... ." He blamed the government for arming the LTTE and 
      putting them in power. When the LTTE and the army tried to exercise dual 
      power in the East it had to end up in conflict. It further said, "Our 
      party feel that the LTTE must be defeated by all democratic forces which 
      strive for civilised existence in the North and east.... . We also want 
      the government to be defeated in the South. We make no preference for the 
      government as against the LTTE.... . There is a lot of fury being focussed 
      against the Tamil people by certain elements who are trying to whip up Sinhala 
      passions against the Tamils. It is the duty of the civilised citizens to 
      protect the Tamils at this juncture.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">The LTTE must come to an understanding with all Tamil 
      group and Tamil speaking Muslims which must be laid out as a pre-condition 
      for any kind of discussion for a ceasefire."</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">The NSSP continued to make representations both 
      in Parliament and privately about what was being done to the civilians in 
      the North-East.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><b><font color="#990000"><a href="/uthrj/Misalaneous/slfp">The SLFP</a>:</font></b><font color="#990000"> 
      The position of SLFP, the leading opposition party and alternative government, 
      has been ambiguous. It supported the government in its bid to crush the 
      LTTE. It voted for the supplementary defence estimate. It also sent a 
      representative on the delegation to explain the conduct of the war to SAARC 
      countries. But when it came to voting for the extension of emergency powers 
      on the 19th July the party abstained. The party has found itself divided, 
      while some members pointed out that having gone so far, to refuse the government 
      the emergency powers to conduct the war, was meaningless. Thus the alternative 
      government found itself without a policy. Other left sources said that 
      at least 40 MPs from the SLFP had expressed a willingness to oppose the 
      government's position.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">To trace the reasons for this confusion we go back 
      to a hard hitting speech made by Mrs. Sirima Bandaranaiake, the leader of 
      the opposition, in Parliament on 12th January, attacking the government's 
      human rights record. Mrs. Bandaranaiake is also challenging in court the 
      validity of the presidential elections. Extracts from the speech are quoted 
      from the Island of 13th January: " It is no secret that politically backed 
      para military hit squads continued to abduct and murder youth through the 
      length and breadth of our country. In the guise of combating subversion 
      thousands of SLFP members had been arrested, abducted or murdered by these 
      killer squads. Notwithstanding assurance by the government that these hit 
      squads would be brought to book, so far not a single person of these squads 
      had been brought to trial.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">We know for a fact that the majority of security 
      forces and police personnel have had nothing to do with these gruesome gruesome 
      acts. On the contrary they do view dastardly acts with horror, but are constrained 
      due to political patronage enjoyed by the hit squads."</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">"..... Prior to their deployment these killer groups 
      have been provided with false army identity cards. They are also instructed 
      to contact UNP provincial council members to obtain the names of opposition 
      polling agents and destroy them. Certain lists of persons to be killed 
      had been given to these killer squads. These squads have also been put 
      in contact with the co-ordinating officers of various districts. The co-ordinating 
      officers have been given special orders from a high ranking officer at army 
      headquarters to co-operate with these groups and ask no questions. This 
      is the information that I have received.... ."</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">This speech shows that the opposition felt very 
      much threatened by the government's actions. Mrs. Bandaranaike as a past 
      prime minister would have had good sources within the security forces who 
      were sympathetic to her. It would have served both Tamil and Sinhalese 
      interests to give the opposition a free hand in challenging the government's 
      record. When the Tigers and the government clashed in June, Mrs. Bandaranaike 
      found herself bowing to a strong sentiment amongst upper, middle and lower-middle 
      class Sinhalese, that the Tamils should be defeated militarily.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">`Sunday Times' of 22nd July reported what happened 
      at the meeting of the parliamentary group of the SLFP, to discuss voting 
      on the extension of the emergency on 19th July. Several influential MPs 
      including Nimal Siripala de Silva, Jayaraj Fernandopulle, Richard Pathirana, 
      Ananda Dassanayake, Lakshman Kiriella, S.B. Dissanayake and M.K.D.S. Gunawardena 
      were against the emergency.</font> <br>
      <font color="#990000"></font> <br>
      <font color="#990000">The Gampha district MP said the earlier slogan was 
      `kill Tamils' and today under the guise of `kill Tigers', Tamils are being 
      killed. He asked why the SLFP should involve itself in a government LTTE 
      fight?</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">Mr. Kiriella said that everyday 40 bodies were burning 
      on the road sides in Kandy and voting for the emergency would be condoning 
      these acts as well. He said that the party should not support the emergency 
      because of this.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">Mr. S.L. Gunasekara, who spoke in favour of the emergency 
      said the SLFP voted in favour of a massive supplementary estimate (US $125 
      million) for the defence ministry to buy arms and ammunition. He asked 
      how the party could now vote against giving the security forces, the power 
      to use these weapons. The party leader Mr. Bandaranaike final decided that 
      as there were two points of view on the emergency, the party would abstain.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">It is surprising that Mr.s Bandaranaike who well 
      understood the nature of the security forces decided to stand back and pretend 
      that a just and disciplined war was being conducted in the Tamil areas. 
      Having herself said that thousands of her supporters had been arrested, 
      abducted or murdered, she clearly had on her hands a human rights problem 
      affecting a very large section of her constituency. By legitimising the 
      actions of the armed forces in Tamil areas, the SLFP was not only letting 
      down this constituency, but was helping to whitewash one of the ugliest 
      periods of this country's history. By this stand of the SLFP, a large section 
      of the Sinhalese electorate that had been visited with terror, humiliation 
      and destitution was being left orphaned. What will we do when one day their 
      angry young men demand justice and accountability? Do we double the strength 
      of the security forces and increase defence expenditure to 40%? The</font> 
      <br>
      <font color="#990000">SLFP stands in danger of finishing up a vestigial 
      adjunct to the UNP.. The feelings of those who have lost near and dear ones 
      cannot be assuaged by killing Tamils.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">The only alternative open to the SLFP was to stand 
      firm on principle on the human rights issue and challenge the government's 
      moral authority and competence to assume responsibility for solving this 

      country's problems. As inexcusable as are the actions of the Tigers, anyone 
      who can accomplish some good must in the first place command moral authority 
      and goodwill.</font> <a href="#top">[Top]</a>
