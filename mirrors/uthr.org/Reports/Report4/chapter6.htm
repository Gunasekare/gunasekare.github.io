    <p><br>

      <font color="#990000"><font size=+2>I</font>t is generally agreed by observers 
      in the south that the support for the current war comes mainly from the 
      upper, middle and lower middle classes. Below, there is simmering resentment 
      against the state and the forces, for what they did to thousands of their 
      sons and daughters. The classes supportive of the war are basically those 
      who do not question the established order. During the state's campaign 
      of counter-terror against the JVP, this support for the state waned for 
      two reasons. Many had serious moral qualms against the campaign. The other 
      was the JVP's terror, then ubiquitous in Colombo itself. Even permanent 
      secretaries stayed at home when told to do so by the JAP. No one dared 
      to support the state publicly. The state and the forces complained of isolation. 
      The fight against a Tamil foe restored the armed forces to their legitimate 
      `Mahavamsa' role. This is based on a semi-mythical ancient battle between 
      the Tamil king Elara and his victorious rival Dutugemunu. Through school 
      history text books in particular, it has become a part of the living culture 
      of the South. It was natural that these classes should jump on the present 
      war as a festival of reconciliation with the state. The excess shown in 
      this rush to support the state can be seen as partly an apology for their 
      silence when the JVP was around. An opportunity for such gestures was provided 
      by the president's National Defence Fund, given much fanfare by film stars 
      and school children handing over their tills to the president on television.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">To our knowledge it was left to one left wing political 
      party, the NSSP and a small group of university dons in the south to give 
      the lead in combatting this trend of militarism, by separately launching 
      alternative funds for all victims of violence. Smaller groups within the 
      church followed a similar course independently of the leadership. Through 
      canvassing for these funds people came understand the real feelings of ordinary 
      people. Quite often factory workers and minor employees responded readily 
      to this alternative fund. Sometimes union leaders and party activists who 
      canvassed for the alternative fund were threatened by persons in uniform. 
      A number of persons in the lower categories expressed feelings of resentment 
      against state forces and said that they knew that what was being done to 
      the Tamils is not different from what was done to them.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">A feeling common to many Sinhalese and Tamils at 
      this time is that issue of freedom are real, but the use of violence counter-productive. 
      The legacy of the violence of the JVP and of the Tamil militant groups has 
      led to a state of exhaustion and collapse of freedom as well as social life 
      itself. The JVP's initial campaign in 1987 was aimed at hitting at persons 
      close to the state who were resented and hence had some popular support. 
      The use of violence often leads to a feeling of absolute power and this 
      violence of the JVP soon went out of control in gruesome killings of anyone 
      whose ideas were a threat to them - such as leading figures of the left. 
      When the JVP closed hospitals, killed several tens of van drivers to enforce 
      a transport stoppage and threatened and sometimes killed relatives of security 
      men, it, in the eyes many, legitimised the state's counter terror.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000"> Having grown accustomed to unrestrained killing, 
      the dangerous illusion of absolute power now rests with the state. When 
      the state becomes insensitive to the law and loses the capacity and will 
      to discipline its agents, it comes close to disintegration. This is the 
      greatest threat to the sovereignty of Sri Lanka. A very large share of 
      the blame for this process must be laid on the shoulders of ex-President 
      J.R. Jayawardene who established the tradition of casually tinkering with 
      laws to have his way. Once this process begins, foreign involvement is 
      only incidental and often fills a vacuum created by the state itself. Thus 
      Indian involvement was a symptom and not the problem. The illusion of absolute 
      power can also be seen at work in the tragic history of the Tamil militant 
      groups.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">In the south, more than 300 university students 
      are counted amongst the disappeared. The students community at large is 
      in a state of terrified apathy. In a number of cases, the university authorities 
      have not been able to persuade students to put them selves forward for elections 
      to student bodies. Where students have come forward, it is often because 
      there are staff members and unions whom they trust and are confident, will 
      fight for their rights. A comparable situation exists in the Tamil areas.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">At places of work, an under-paid employee who asks 
      for a wage rise can be branded a subversive and handed over to the police. 
      In the present state of lawlessness no one can guarantee the fate of such 
      a person, whether man or woman. Disappearances and burning bodies are an 
      established institution in national life.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">Many of the students who disappeared or were killed 
      by rival groups were, in terms of ability and commitment to justice, among 
      the finest of that generation. Those who judge persons by their associations 
      must keep in mind that, in a phase of our history characterised by a chronic 
      state of violence, any well meaning person who associates with a group or 
      person, whose affiliations he imperfectly understood, could become an unwitting 
      accomplice in even acts of murder. In the North, this happened to members 
      of citizens' committees, members of political parties and quite often to 
      members of militant groups. Many of those who were killed are ordinary, 
      decent, sensitive persons, whose offence was their effectiveness at promoting 
      ideas which posed a political threat. Many others today live in hiding, 
      fearing for their lives, and yet eager to understand and take stands on 
      issues of justice and on minority issues.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">As the conflict proceeds, its true nature is being 
      blacked out in the South. The army is paying a heavy price in casualties. 
      One surgeon in Trincomalee said that he alone had performed 50 foot amputations 
      in a month. The triumphalistic coverage fails to bring the cost home.To 
      those better off, casualities are just numbers. Only a handful of persons 
      is questioning the cause for which poor young men are being asked to pay 
      the price. It serves the state now to black out killings of Tamil civilians, 
      while publicising the equally dastardly and inexcusable killings of Sinhalese 
      ands Muslim civilians.</font> <br>
      <font color="#990000">Economic and Social problems have been swept under 
      the carpet. But the truth will seep in and a mood of disillusionment will 
      set in. the competence of statement, the intellectuals and the intelligentsia 
      will be questioned. Whether it will come with foreign intervention as in 
      1987 or in some other form, only time will tell.</font> <a href="#top">[Top]</a>
