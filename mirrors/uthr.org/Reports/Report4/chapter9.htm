    <p><font color="#990000"><font size=+2>W</font>e include here further reports 
      received after the earlier section was written and are intended to complement 
      earlier ones. Information from badly affected areas is still scarce.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000"><b>Kalmunai. About 20th June:</b> Kalmunai was 
      subject to aerial attacks from helicopters after the army made a `tactical' 
      withdrawal on 16th June. A number of persons were killed. When the army 
      re-entered Kalmunai a few days later, foreign journals quoting leading citizens 
      said that 150 Tamils were killed and burnt in Tamil shops. Mr. Kanapathipillai, 
      better known as Pandiyooran, who was head of the Kalmunai citizens' committee 
      and known for his outspokenness, was associated with these reports. He 
      was also outspoken in holding that boundary disputes resulting from encroachment 
      of Tamil lands by Muslims landlords must be resolved. He is said to have 
      had many enemies amongst the latter. Fearing for the safety of his sons,he 
      had sent his two sons to shelter with a muslim friend, shortly before the 
      government forces came in. The government forces, when they came in had 
      with them local members of the Jihad, who had fled to Colombo in 1988. 
      These persons were recognised in military uniform by a number of persons.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">Kanapathipillai's two sons fell into the hands of 
      government forces. They were seen being led around Kalmunai, with their 
      hands linked by wires driven through holes made in their palms. They were 
      asked to point out Tiger supporters and hiding places. Not having had much 
      success, one son was shot dead publicly. The other who was badly beaten 
      was taken to the fathers place which was ransacked. The father was taken 
      away and the father with the remaining son have not been seen again. The 
      previous day Kanapathipillai had telephoned a friend in Colombo with a desperate 
      appeal: "They are simply taking our boys and are knifing ahooting and burning 
      them. For God's sake do something!" With the disappearance of Pandiyooran 
      Kanapathipillai, citizens' committees in the area were terror struck. Information 
      virtually dried up.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">The government's use of the Jihad created widespread 
      anger against Muslims. Amongst the many Tamil youth assembled to be taken 
      away for questioning in buses were 26 girls. 3 girls were released after 
      some local Muslims protested to Jihad members standing there that the girls 
      were nurses and nothing else. The following weeks were to see LTTE reprisals 
      against Muslim targets.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">The government too appeared to have no hesitation 
      in fuelling communal hatred between Tamils and Muslims. The remarks by 
      the Minister of Defence concerning the killing of 15 PLOTE members has been 
      refereed to earlier. Here the minister had focussed attention away from 
      the actual indefensible act of knifing and burning the detainees, to Muslim 
      informants. In Kalmunai Tamil citizens eventually did contact an army official 
      about the killings, the disappearance of the citizens' committee chief and 
      burnings of premises, including a church building. The army official shifted 
      most of the blame onto Muslims.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000"><b>Trincomalee:</b> We are not certain of the 
      order of events, or how troubles broke out. It appears that the LTTE fired 
      at an army convoy that refused orders to stop on 13th June. The LTTE then 
      collected 10 policemen from Madaththady and 4 from Sirimapura and shot them. 
      People were then asked to flee and were told that they would be given protection 
      beyond the 3rd mile post. Many fled their homes towards Nilaweli. The 
      LTTE too had pulled out of Trincomalee by the following morning. When 
      the army came out of Fort Frederick, they killed and burnt a number of persons 
      in Anna Nagar, adjoining the Fort. With the army came a number of Sinhalese, 
      made refugees from 1987. With the coming of the IPKF Tamils took revenge 
      against Sinhalese settlers who had lorded or over with Sri Lankan army help 
      in earlier years, by burning Sinhalese premises. Now it was the turn of 
      the Sinhalese.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">In Trinco town itself there was not much killing. 
      But there was widespread burning and looting by the army and by Sinhalese 
      refugees.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">A number of patients from the Trincomalee hospital 
      adjoining Ann Nagar, were also pulled out and killed. Those killed were 
      mostly patients who had sustained injuries or those who had themselves admitted 
      out of fear.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">Thought information is scarce the following incidents 
      came to our notice. Mr. Subramaniam, a retired Colombo Municipal Council 
      employee was living in Trincomalee with his expectant daughter. His son-in-law 
      who was in Batticaloa and his daughter were pawn brokers. The daughter 
      wanted to rejoin her husband after the troubles broke out. Subramaniam 
      set out with her in the confidence that his age would guarantee immunity. 
      Soldiers who stopped them asked the pregnant lady to proceed and took away 
      the father. The father has since been missing.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">On withdrawing from Trincomalee on 13th June, the 
      LTTE quickly went to Nilaveli where a large number of refugees had gathered. 
      It then pulled out from Nilaveli in the face of the army advance from the 
      north and the south. Because the army advance was barely resisted, there 
      was little damage at Sambaltivu. About 20 civilians including a man in 
      his late 40's were taken away by the army from a refugee camp at Nilaveli. 
      The family of this man had made repeated inquiries and his release, though 
      promised, has not materialised. Nor was contact or verification permitted.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">In early July, the army advanced on Thambalakaman 
      which was under the control of the LTTE. Thinking that the advance would 
      be resisted, a number of civilians sheltered in bunkers during the exchange 
      of fire. Unknown to them the LTTE had made a sudden withdrawal and the 
      army was upon them. The soldiers threw grenades into bunkers as they advanced, 
      killing civilians. About 17 young civilian refugees were taken away from 
      Konesar temple and a nearby school and are believed to have been killed.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">An unspecified number of refugees, children amongst 
      them, were taken by the army from St.Anthony's church in Mutur and the worst 
      is believed concerning their fate. Some Muslims were reported killed subsequently 
      in an apparent reprisal attack.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">The Daily News of 16th June reported that 23 out 
      of the 60 policemen in Kinniya were lined up and shot.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">Siyambalanduwe, Moneragala District: Between 
      16th-20th June, 12 Tamils were burnt to death by thugs. One of them was 
      a Tamil doctor married to a Sinhalese who was stationed at the 17th mile 
      post. During the same period in Amparai, mobs killed 100 Tamil coolies 
      who laboured in fields. They have been persistent and helpless victims 
      of bouts of violence.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000"><b>Colombo:</b> Hundreds of Tamil boys were arrested 
      shortly after the outbreak of war. Two boys arrested at Wellawatte were 
      taken to Mahara prison, 6 miles north of Colombo and were left with Sinhalese 
      prisoners. Their bodies were later handed over to relatives. The present 
      practice appears to be that any Tamil person brought in on suspicion by 
      the police will be locked up with whoever else is there - drug addicts, 
      assorted maniacs etc. A typical example was that of a father and soon who 
      crossed the road after dinner to buy some Indian sweets. At the best they 
      would be released after someone identifies them, statements are recorded 
      and police records are checked. The minimum time is two days.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">In the case of the two boys killed, there was not 
      even an inquiry. There has been no public campaign in Colombo against such 
      blatant, but perhaps unintended, racism by the vast number of organisations 
      concerned in such matters.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000"><b>The East:</b> See report by James Pringle from 
      the Times of London in Appendix II.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000"><b>Miscellaneous:</b> About 20th June a van from 
      Trincomalee was stopped at Horawapotana and 12 Tamil passengers were taken 
      away by the army. A women passenger who screamed and refused to get out 
      escaped because one of the three foreigners in the van claimed to be her 
      husband. The following day 4 persons in Muslim attire travelling in a Lancer 
      were stopped and detained, apparently for looking too closely at burning 
      bodies nearby. The car and the van were subsequently seen for days at the 
      police station. This incident was related to a Left party official by local 
      villagers. The same official was told by a police sub-inspector in Anuradhapura 
      that two bodies found burning near the Anuradhapura bus stand were those 
      of Tamil boys found with cyanide capsules. In a number of instances rumours 
      identifying Sinhalese persons killed as being Tigers cauht locally, were 
      associated with the poliece.This happened in Kandy. In the Chilaw area, 
      six bodies burnt were claimed to be those of Tigers caught in the Local 
      Tamil village of Udappu. Two papers reported that six Tigers were killed 
      while crossing the Kelani river boardering colombo. When official sources 
      claimed that the dead were victims of a gang fight, the papers maintained 
      that they had published the police version.</font> <br>

    <p><font color="#990000">LATE REPORT: Massacre at Kattankudy, 3rd August 
      1990</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">The sunday Island of 5th August reported that 8.15 
      p.m., about 3o LTTE men arrived in Kattankudy in two wagons. They divided 
      into two groups and simultaneously attacked Meera Jumma and Hussainiya mosques, 
      firing automatics and throwing grenades. Over 120 Muslims, men and boys, 
      were killed. Over 75 others were seriously wounded. Many of the victims 
      were praying at the time of the incident. The attackers, some of whom were 
      attired in military fatigues are believed to have escaped by boat. Brigade 
      Commander (Batticaloa) A.N.U. Senviratne said that the army moved into 
      Kattankudy from Araipattai and Kallady camps within fifteen minutes of the 
      receipt of information. Responsibility for the massacre was denied by the 
      LTTE.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">We must admit shame that such crimes are a direct 
      consequence of the intolerance, arrogance and hate that have come to characterise 
      the dominant Tamil politics. To understand such phenomena, like the Anuradhapura 
      massacre, this too has a historical process behind it. This in on way exonerated 
      those responsible for killing.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">We have noted in this report that there was a great 
      deal of anger in the East against the government for its killing of several 
      hundreds of young Tamils. We also have many instances where senior government 
      functionaries have tried to deflect this anger onto Muslims. Official spokesmen 
      have been quoted a number of times to the effect that Muslim youth had come 
      forward to help government forces. [eg. Speech in Parliament by the Minister 
      of Defence, 7th August]. The Eastern Tamil would have read this as saying 
      that Muslims are aiding the killing of Tamil youth. The government could 
      not have been naive about this. The policy of dividing Tamils and Muslims 
      had been deliberately pursued since 1984. A senior Tamil government official 
      from Batticaloa, a lady, had said a few days before the incident: "There 
      is blatant discrimination here. Our young are being slaughtered. Nearly 
      all the relief supplies that are sent are channelled to Muslims and Sinhalese. 
      There is so much anger against Muslims that it is boiling over. An eruption 
      can hardly be controlled". It is not possible for local Muslim officials 
      by themselves to effect discrimination in the distribution of supplies, 
      without the connivance of Colombo. Many expected something to happen, but 
      the form it took, shocked them. The government's own intelligence could 
      hardly have failed to detect the tense mood. A Muslim public servant from 
      Kattankudy was very angry with the LTTE when he heard of the incident. 
      After pondering the context over the next few days, he said that he was 
      puzzled. He had heard from home that when the firing had started, Muslims 
      ran for help to the army camp on the border of Kattankudy and the Tamil 
      village of Araipattai 1 km away. The army said that the road would be mined 
      and had taken 20-25 mins to get there. Rightly or wrongly Muslim villagers 
      were left with the impression that the army had not acted as if they were 
      on the alert. This led to rumours amongst the Muslim community. The SLMC 
      leader Mr. Ashraff, said soon after the incident, "We are disappointed 
      and disillusioned at the indifference shown by the government regarding 
      the security of the Muslim community in the North-East province." He also 
      urged the Muslims to remain calm and not to be provoked into violence. 
      Ashraff had generally been sensitive to the sentiments of Tamils.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">There was the other puzzling feature that in other 
      areas under its control, the LTTE was actually releasing Muslim policemen 
      under its custody. This was admitted officially. The Sinhalese policemen 
      in its custody are not accounted for. The LTTE leadership was at some pains 
      to show that it was not anti-Muslim. An attack on Muslims of a `genocidal' 
      character would appear to be incongruous with this. Mr. Wijeratne, Minister 
      of Defence, quoting in parliament a confidential intelligence report, said 
      that the LTTE's Batticaloa leader Karuna had radioed the Jaffna High Command 
      mid-night, 4th August, that his boys had fired at Sri Lanka-army trained 
      Muslim youth at Kattankudy. He accused the LTTE top leadership of covering 
      up, rather of than having pre-knowledge of the incident. This reminds us 
      of the massacre of policemen who had surrendered in the East, about 11th 
      June. The LTTE spokesman in Jaffna after denying it had later said that 
      he could neither confirm nor deny it. The LTTE's top leadership could not 
      have been blind to the diplomatic consequences of such massacres.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">One must admit a strong possibility that the LTTE 
      in the East is responding some what to local feelings and fears, rather 
      than strictly to the aims of the leadership. One would have expected such 
      a leadership crisis in an organisation which has downgraded politics and 
      had treated dissent and opposition with ruthlessness.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">Following this massacre there were reports of over 
      40 Muslim peasants being killed further south over the next two days. The 
      reports added that a note tied to a corpse warned Muslims to vacate the 
      area. This was an area in which reports coming in suggest that an unspecified 
      number of Tamils had been abducted or killed. Together with the Kattankudy 
      massacre, these later reports received much media publicity. Like earlier 
      massacres of Tamils, a report by a TELO MP for the area that 40 Tamils had 
      been killed, found a place only on the BBC's Tamil Service on 7th August. 
      Such calculated partiality only serves to further alienate Tamil from the 
      state and drive them towards dependence on India.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">As one observer put it, the whole episode has a 
      murky character reminiscent of the PLOTE invasion of the Maldives in 1988. 
      One can be sure that the bizarre alliances of the Sri Lankan state has much 
      to do with it. Its adoption of the LTTE in April 1989; its glee over the 
      discomfiture of the SLMC when the LTTE attained control of the North-East; 
      its giving its erstwhile ally, Israel, the boot in April 1990; Its wooing 
      of the Muslims and the SLMC to crush the LTTE when relations with the latter 
      broke down; and finally going to Iraq and Libya, Israel's arch enemies, 
      for arms to fight the LTTE. The truth may be long coming, but it will surface. 
      While the Sri Lankan state is tied up in knots, the LTTE has to look to 
      the future with its own regrettable legacy. For the people of the East, 
      there are bleak times ahead.</font> <a href="#top">[Top]</a>
