    <p><br>
      <b><font color="#990000"></font></b> 
    <p><font color="#990000"><b>WAR AND THE CIVILIANS:</b> It must be borne 
      in mind that detailed information on civilian causalities during the course 
      of this war will not be known for several months. in view of gross public 
      misrenpresentations, particularly in the press, about the scale of civilian 
      suffering, we find it necessary to put down what has been said by reliable 
      witnesses and has been cross shacked throughout other sources. Our Sources 
      are almost all persons holding responsible positions in public life. A 
      failure to understand the immense tragedy of this conflict and the manner 
      in which divisions are being used for tactical military advantage, raising 

      old suspicions to vicious hatreds, will only deepen the moral drift and 
      uncertainty in this country.</font> <br>
      <font color="#990000"></font><b><font color="#990000"></font></b> 
    <p><font color="#990000"><b>EASTERN PROVINCE (SOUTHERN SECTOR):</b> Most 
      observers agree that the unjustifiable suffering inflicted by Sri Lankan 
      forces on civilians here, must also be seen in part was reprisals for the 
      killing by the LTTE of unarmed policeman who had surrendered. While the 
      decision to take on Sri Lankan forces in all sectors was almost certainly 
      taken by the LTTE at top level, the decision to kill the policemen may have 
      been taken by the local leadership. It may be noted that police personnel 
      who surrendered in Batticaloa were handed over to the air force. It is also 
      puzzling that a Tamil guerilla group should do something calculated to make 
      sworn enemies of Muslims and Sinhalese in an area where the Tamils were 
      weakest and vulnerable.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">It has been noted that the police personnel in the 
      area surrendered to the Tigers on 11th June. Policemen from the areas surrounding 
      Kalmunai were assembled at Vinayagapuram, south of Kalmunai. The Sinhalese 
      and Muslim policemen were herded into one lot and the Tamil policemen into 
      another. Both lots were assaulted by LTTE cadre. Boys as young as 12 are 
      said to have been used in this operation. Subsequently, the Sinhalese and 
      Muslim policemen were driven westward into the jungle in buses, in batches. 
      That many of them were massacred has been corroborated in several reports. 
      The first report came from a Sinhalese policemen who escaped with injuries 
      with the help of Tamil village women. Tamil police sources, now living 
      in fear, said that the operation went on over two days, and the number of 
      policemen killed is put at above 200. The Tamil policemen were released. 
      Six of the latter were said to have been killed, either by police colleagues 
      or by the army. According to local sources, there were among the victims 
      105 Muslim policemen from the nearby areas of Komary, Akkaraipattu and Attalachchenai. 
      A senior Sinhalese police official and his wife were kept by the Tigers 
      ia a house at Tambiluvil and were released later.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">When STF commandos subsequently advanced to Kalmunai, 
      a number of Tamils were killed on the first day. The killings continued 
      on subsequent days as young men were rounded up or detained. The post master 
      of Kalmunai, one of whose sons disappeared after being detained in Kandy 
      in 1986, lost two more of his sons during this period. It has been said 
      by many persons that anyone arrested, whether on information, suspicion 
      or on fancy, is in grave danger. A Muslim serviceman may have put it only 
      a little too strongly, when he told some civilians, "No one who goes into 
      the Karaitivu army camp as a detainee comes out alive." A unit of the Sinha 
      regiment had later replaced the STF. Nearly every Tamil shop in kalmunai 
      was burnt, quite often with mutilated Tamil corpses inside.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">Apart from the agony, there was among the people 
      a sense of outrage and disbelief. Several young boys had been picked up 
      and killed because they had been friendly with the Tigers. The owner of 
      a photographic Studio in Kalmunai had been killed, because Tigers had come 
      to him to be photographed and had paid good money. They asked, "Was not 
      President Premadasa himself happy to have his photograph taken with Tiger 
      leaders? Did not the government itself place a seal of approval on friendship 
      with Tigers? Why kill a man who made his living taking photographs? Why 
      kill young boys for whom it is natural to strike up conversations out of 
      curiosity, with those in uniform carrying arms?"</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">The following details were supplied by a senior 
      figure from the East in a national political party, a Muslim. He has himself 
      cautioned that the figures should be looked at less for accuracy than for 
      an impression about the scale of the problem. Those reports nearer his 
      home are more accurate.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">20.6: 40 arrested at Veeramunai and killed and burnt 
      inside two houses at Walathapiddy.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">26.6: (Press report - Virakesari) 29 bodies burnt 
      in Kalmunai and 20 at Karaitivu.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">27.6: (Press report - Virakesari) 400 youths were 
      arrested at Akkaraipathu and taken to Kalmunai.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">29.6: 82 persons were killed and burnt at Weddukkadu.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000"> 1.7: 45 persons, including 4 women were killed 
      and burnt at Weddukkadu.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000"> 5.7: 85 skulls were found opposite Wesley College, 
      at Kalmunai.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">5-7.7: About 100 persons were killed at Korakkovil.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000"> 7.7: A temple was burnt and about 45 persons were 
      killed and burnt at Ninthavur.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000"> 10.7: 15 persons were arrested by the army at Kalmunai 
      market, of whom 4 were stabbed to death.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">In the meantime many Tamil civilians had been killed 
      at Amparai as the result of mob violence in which policemen in and out of 
      uniform played a key role. One witness said that he had escaped by hiding 
      in the lavatory when policemen in uniform came looking for Tamils. Mr. 
      & Mrs. Sinnathamby who were senior members of the Methodist Church in Amparai, 
      took refuge in their church. On receiving advice that this church was unsafe, 
      they went to the Roman Catholic Church. A mob which broke in took people 
      away, including the Sinnathambys. The couple has since been missing. The 
      number killed at Amparai is placed at over a hundred.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">10th July was the 30th day following the abduction 
      and killing of policemen in the East. The day started quietly in Kalmunai. 
      A group of Soldiers was seen taking up positions at the Kalmunai Rest House 
      junction. Several passers by were detained, including Dr and Mrs. Shanmugam 
      who had come from Paddiruppu. Four of the detainees were stabbed to death 
      and their bodies were thrown behind two Muslim shops which were set on fire. 
      There were evidently no more Tamil shops to burn. It must be noted that 
      nearly all killings of civilians took place when there was no threat to 
      the lives of servicemen. That there were four mutilated corpses behind 
      the shops was established from Muslims who came to retrieve what could be 
      saved from the burning shops. But we have not been able to establish with 
      certainty whether Dr & Mrs Shanmugam were among them.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">The soldiers withdrew to the camp that morning itself 
      with some detainees. About mid-night the same day, a single burst of machine 
      gun fire was heard from the army camp. It was clearly not a confrontation. 
      A senior citizen reported several days later that 42 persons were killed 
      on that day. A Tamil MP who toured that area said that more than 160 persons 
      were killed in the Kalmunai-Karaitivu areas.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000"><b>TRINCOMALEE:</b> Trouble was rumoured on 13th 
      June. Residents cringed in fear during the night while the LTTE and the 
      army exchanged fire, with the LTTE shelling army positions. Civilians pleaded 
      with the LTTE to withdraw, and by morning the LTTE had withdrawn from Trincomalee 
      town. It was quite on the morning of the 14th and the civilians hoped for 
      the best. Across Cottiar Bay during the night, the LTTE had ambused a group 
      of l00 commandos who had been landed at Brown Rock Point, killing over 40 
      of them including Major Azad.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">When the army came out, there was no provocation 
      from the LTTE. An executive who lived near the Fort Frederick area said 
      that the army rounded up 38 young men from his neighbourhood and promptly 
      shot them. He had been in one of the two houses left out. He had personally 
      identified 60 dead persons. There were a number of cases of persons being 
      burnt with tyres, even while alive, and of patients being dragged out of 
      hospital and not heard of again. A young boy of about 15 was admitted to 
      hospital with leg burns after soldiers had tried to burn him alive with 
      a tire. He was under the care of the MSF (Medicines Sans Frontiers). Soldiers 
      who came into the hospital forcibly removed him and the he was not seen 
      again. Most patients admitted to hospitals had burn injuries.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">An elderly father going with his young son was seen 
      by the army. The son tried to run away in fear and was shot dead. As he 
      was burnt with tires, the father was ordered to lie by his side. Unable 
      to bear the pain and agony, the father asked a soldier to shoot him as well. 
      The soldier pushed him aside with his foot. The father was admitted to 
      hospital with burn injuries.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">There was also widespread burning of houses and 
      buildings. A lady pleaded with soldiers not to burn her house as her husband 
      paralysed from neck downwards was inside. She went away after soldiers 
      threatened her, thinking that her husband would be spared. She returned 

      to find her house burnt with no trace of her husband. The Assemblies of 
      God church where a Sri Lankan army brigadier was a regular worshipper had 
      also been burnt down.</font> <br>
      <font color="#990000"></font> <br>
      <font color="#990000">A number of refugees had gone North to Nilaveli, 
      in the hope of making it to safer places further North. From Nilaveli, 
      many walked along jungle tracks to Mullaitivu. Two professionals who came 
      back to Trincomalee to fetch their wives said that 4 boat loads of refugees 
      who had tried to make it from Nilaveli to Mullaitivu by sea had been sunk 
      by the Sri Lankan navy.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">Trincomalee folk who were in refugee camps were 
      urged by the authorities to return to their homes. But after such an experience 
      the people felt safer in numbers. The reason for this urging is said to 
      have been the smuggling in of foreign correspondents by the LTTE. However, 
      people began to leave after the army took over the protection of refugee 
      camps. The number of civilians killed in the Trincomalee district will 
      certainly run into several hundreds.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000"><b>BATTICALOA:</b> In comparison with Trincomalee, 
      the effect of the army's entry into Batticaloa town were not server. But 
      there had been causalities due to aerial strafing. Mr. N. Mahesan, Lecturer 
      in statistics at Batticaloa University, was amongst those killed, when a 
      passenger van was fired at from a helicopter. One reason given for the 
      lack of severity in Batticaloa is that the LTTE had handed over the policemen 
      who surrendered to the Sri Lankan air force. The initial entry of the army 
      into Kallaru is also said to have been relatively without incident.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">When the army encamped at Valaichchenai, Mr. Jegarajasingam, 
      a senior member of the citizen's committee and a member of the IVS (International 
      Volunteer Service) approached the army in the morning and was courteously 
      received. He told them that they would like to co-operate with the army 
      to look after the interests of the people. He was asked to return that 
      afternoon. Mr. Jegarajasingam returned to the army camp that afternoon 
      and was not seen alive again.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">As days wore on army round ups and picking up of 
      suspects commended, in Batticaloa town and in the surrounding suburbs. 
      Burnt dead bodies by the road side, reminiscent of the campaign in the South, 
      have since then become a regular feature. The rough rate is estimated at 
      about 5 a day, based on eye witness reports.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">At the time of writing, the army had vacated many 
      of its positions outside Batticaloa town. In Valaichchenai, a witness saw 
      Tigers standing with their guns `as if nothing had happened'.</font> <br>
      <font color="#990000">The villagers were terrified. Men, women, children, 
      infants in arms, with bags, on bicycle or on foot can be seen moving to 
      and for in a mood of uncertainty and fear. Many people trek miles to the 
      big Roman Catholic church at Thethathivu for the nights and return to their 
      homes by day.</font> <br>
      <font color="#990000"></font><b><font color="#990000"></font></b> 
    <p><font color="#990000"><b>HOW THIRUKKOVIL WAS SAVED:</b> During the third 
      week of June, the Tigers were in Thirukkovil, a town south of Kalmunai, 

      while the army was approaching it from the north and the STF from the south. 
      The people were in a state of great anxiety. The local citizens' committee 
      comprising the AGA, and two clergymen from the Methodist and Roman Catholic 
      church, took stock of the situation and went into action. They knew Mr. 
      Ratnayake, the STF chief commanding the advance from the south. He had 
      been posted in the East during 1987 and had earned an uncommon reputation 
      for being concerned about the civilian population under his charge.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">The citizens' committee members approached the LTTE 
      and persuaded them to leave Thirukkovil. They then went to Mr. Ratnayake 
      and told him the situation and requested him to occupy the town before the 
      army came in. This was done, and Thirukkovil remained largely trouble free. 
      It also become a place of refugee for people in neighbouring areas. Thirukkovil 
      was held up as one ray of hope in a picture of unrelieved gloom.</font>

      <font color="#990000"></font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000"><b>JAFFNA:</b> About mid July, the mood in Jaffna 
      was one of panic. There had been a good deal of aerial bombardment which 
      was mostly concentrated around Jaffna Fort, in the vicinity of the town, 
      where the government was a attempting to bring relief to its besieged troops. 
      Parts of town around hospital road and First Cross Street were badly damaged. 
      Bombs also fell in parts of the city far removed from the Fort. Helicopter 
      strafing was more indiscriminate. According to Roman Catholic church sources, 
      "It will not be an exaggeration to say that around 50 civilians were killed 
      due to aerial attacks around town." In a country where a life time's earnings 
      barely suffice to build a house, a person who loses his house is totally 
      destitute. For this reason many people in threatened areas, take a fatalistic 
      view and remain in their homes.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">Everyone who has been through such experiences knows 
      that the government's claim about attacking well identified targets is an 
      eye wash.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">We give below excerpts from a statement made by 
      a senior Roman Catholic clergyman from Jaffna: "Several of us came out 
      of the Bishop's House after a meeting on the 14th of July, when air craft 
      appeared and proceeded to bomb. Several bombs were dropped in places far 
      apart. A bomb apparently aimed at a house near the OLR church, once occupied 
      by the LTTE, flattened the Bible Center adjoining Main Street. A bomb aimed 
      at the Jaffna kachcheri, already vacated by the LTTE, fell near the Boy 
      Scouts' HQ. Six civilians were killed on that day. The single LTTE casualty 
      had nothing to do with the bombing. That was caused by the overturning 
      of an LTTE vehicle."</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">"The government's stated policy of hitting terrorists 
      from the air is like swatting mosquitoes with a hammer. Many of the aerial 
      attacks on civilians are not necessarily planned, but come from a casual 
      indifference to civilian life. For one thing, the LTTE is very mobile. 
      They fire at aircraft, from wherever they are sighted, at any time. No 
      harm comes to the aircraft. But the airman is angry, and gives a chase."</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">"About 10th July, a vehicle from which the LTTE 
      had fired at passing aircraft was chased. The vehicle was abandoned near 
      the Colombogam Seminary and the LTTE vanished. A missile aimed at the vehicle 
      hit the Old Peoples' Home. Fortunately there were no casualties from the 
      home. Some clergy at the seminary tuned into the FM band to listen into 
      the air-men's talk. They heard the command, `Mission aborted. Return to 
      base.' On the way back, the helicopter gunships emptied their ammunition 
      into the village of Ariyalai. I do not know how many, but I was told that 
      there were civilian casualties.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">"To get some idea of the accuracy of aerial attacks, 
      take the Jaffna Fort. It is a large target of about 1/4 square mile. When 
      the airforce tried to drop food parcels to the men besieged in the fort, 
      they felt all over the place. A food parcel even came crashing through the 
      roof of St. Peter's Church, 1/3 of a mile away. How can they bomb houses 
      and vehicles?"</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">"On another occasion, some young men were playing 
      volley ball near a church under construction. A helicopter pilot angered 
      by the sight directed a sortie. An old man who heard the air-men's talk 
      on his FM radio came running and asked the boys to take cover. The pilot 
      of the attack craft came in and reported that the could see no one playing. 
      The operation was called off."</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">People are afraid of travelling in vehicles. Patients 
      from the Jaffna General Hospital have been distributed over a wide area. 
      Doctors have to travel large distances on bicycles to care for the patients. 
      There are no medicines."</font> <br>
      <font color="#990000"></font><b><font color="#990000">What the young fear</font></b><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">The actions of the government are very much to blame 
      for creating a sense of helplessness and hysteria among young Tamils. The 
      tales of thousands of Trincomalee refugee who are trekking into Jaffna after 
      witnessing wanton killing by government forces, indiscriminate aerial attacks 
      etc. are persuading the young that the worst is in store for them. All 
      this is reported in the local press. Many refugee families from Trincomalee 
      are scattered, one member not knowing what happened to the rest. They insert 
      advertisements in the press informing others of their whereabouts. Young 
      boys and girls are actively encouraged to believe that they are going to 
      die, which they are told, they may as well do carrying weapons. Boys and 
      girls are ferried from tutoris and employed in digging bunkers and are brought 
      back at nightfall. In some places, youth have voluntarily set about building 
      air raid shelters. In case of a land attack such shelters could be a liability. 
      In 1987, troops went on the rampage upon seeing such shelters, saying that 
      people built these</font> <br>
      <font color="#990000">on LTTE orders. The atmosphere there is one that 
      promotes total civilian mobilisation, like in Cartage before its destruction 
      by the Romans. The people are in need of urgent reassurance by the Government, 
      rather than further abandonment.</font> <a href="#top">[Top]</a>
