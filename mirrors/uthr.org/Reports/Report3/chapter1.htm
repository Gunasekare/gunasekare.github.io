style='font-family:"Times New Roman";"MS Mincho"'></span></h3>
<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"MS Mincho"'>All-India Radio reported the incident 
  at Adampan as one where a large scale attack was mounted on the IPKF camp and 
  where in the course of fighting 35 LTTE members and a few Indian soldiers were 
  killed. The following account was compiled from local sources.</span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"MS Mincho"'>The IPKF camp in Adampan, near 
  Giant&#146;s tank, in the Mannar district is situated next to the government 
  hospital and is manned by the Madras Regiment. A sizeable group of the LTTE 
  came into that area during the night and fired mortar shells into the IPKF camp 
  from behind the hospital. According to some, a part of the attacking force had 
  entered the hospital premises.An IPKF officer immediately called upon the doctor 
  on duty at the hospital to have it vacated as they were going to retaliate. 
  This was done and the attackers also withdrew from the hospital area. The IPKF 
  suffered no casualties.</span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"MS Mincho"'>Subsequently, the jungle area behind 
  the hospital was subject to </span><span style='"MS Mincho"'>intense shelling 
  from the IPKF camp at Uyilankulam, 5 miles south on the </span><span style='"MS Mincho"'>Mannar 
  -Vavuniya road, causing the attackers to disperse. The following </span><span style='"MS Mincho"'>morning, 
  troops from the Adampan camp went out and in the process told the </span><span style='"MS Mincho"'>agricultural 
  colonies in the surrounding areas to vacate, as there may be </span><span style='"MS Mincho"'>shelling. 
  This resulted in a mass influx of refugees into town. They were </span><span style='"MS Mincho"'>fed 
  for two days by the GA&#146;s office and by NGO&#146;s. One elderly lady is 
  </span><span style='"MS Mincho"'>reported to have been killed during the shelling.<span class=msoIns><ins
cite="mailto:Unknown%20User" datetime="2001-05-30T10:22"></ins></span></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"MS Mincho"'>In a separate incident at Nedunkandal, 
  an IPKF patrol was attacked, resulting in the deaths of 4 soldiers. No reprisals 
  against civilians were reported. The commendable level of humanity and restraint 
  displayed by the IPKF during these incidents stand in stark contrast to its 
  performance inVadamaratchi during the same period.</span></p>
<h4><a name="_Toc515853103"></a><a name="_Toc515855149"><span style='"MS Mincho"'>Incident 
  at Mannar Hospital -9<sup>th</sup> August 1989</span></a><span
style='"MS Mincho"'></span></h4>
<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"MS Mincho"'>The Mannar hospital lies at the 
  T-junction, where the road to Talaimannar takes off from the Thalvupadu road. 
  The Talaimannar road runs briefly to the north past the hospital, which is to 
  the left, and then takes a bend and runs west past the Building Materials Corporation 
  (BMC), to the right of the road. The IPKF has a large camp at the BMC and a 
  small post in the corner of the hospital premises, at the T-junction referred 
  to. Going east from here along the Thalvapadu -Mannar road, there are camps 
  of the EPRLF and TELO.</span></p>
<p><span style='"MS Mincho"'>The small IPKF post in the corner of the hospital 
  premises is over-</span><span style='"MS Mincho";"Courier New"'>looked by the 
  OPD building. On the night of that day, the LTTE is believed </span><span style='"MS Mincho"'>to 
  have come to Mannar island by boat from Vankalai and had landed at </span><span style='"MS Mincho"'>Thalvupadu 
  and entered the hospital from the back. This was at about 8.30 </span><span style='"MS Mincho"'>p.m. 
  On entering the main building of the hospital, all employees and </span><span style='"MS Mincho"'>patients 
  were detained inside. They made their way through the hospital to </span><span style='"MS Mincho"'>the 
  OPD building and took up positions upstairs over-looking the IPKF camp </span><span style='"MS Mincho"'>below. 
  Except for those on sentry duty, the other soldiers came to the camp </span><span style='"MS Mincho"'>for 
  their night&#146;s sleep. When the LTTE opened fire from upstair windows, </span><span style='"MS Mincho"'>the 
  IPKF men hardly stood a chance. A few soldiers reportedly escaped by </span><span style='"MS Mincho"'>climbing 
  over the wall. The LTTE had ringed the area with sentries to make </span><span style='"MS Mincho"'>it 
  difficult for reinforcements to be rushed there. The surrounding IPKF </span><span style='"MS Mincho"'>camps 
  are said to have been uncertain as to what was going on for some </span><span style='"MS Mincho"'>time, 
  because the LTTE had been using Indian weapons, When soldiers from </span><span style='"MS Mincho"'>the 
  BMC camp arrived, the LTTE had left with the captured weapons, reportedly by 
  boat from Thalvupadu. Up to 40 soldiers may have been killed in the </span><span style='"MS Mincho"'>incident.</span></p>
<p><span style='"MS Mincho"'>The subsequent conduct of the IPKF is worthy of praise 
  and took the </span><span style='"MS Mincho"'>townsfolk by surprise, given the 
  general reputation of the IPKF. The troops </span><span style='"MS Mincho"'>that 
  came from the BMC camp that night assured the patients (more than </span><span style='"MS Mincho"'>eighty 
  in number) and the staff that no harm would befall them. The patients left on 
  their own in the morning. The Indian troops conducted themselves in a disciplined 
  manner and no townsfolk came to any harm.</span></p>
<p><span style='"MS Mincho"'>How was such an unthinkable attack made possible? 
  It may be pointed </span><span style='"MS Mincho"'>out here that the atmosphere 
  in Mannar town was fairly relaxed. The level </span><span style='"MS Mincho"'>of 
  fraternisation between Indian troops and local people was of a high </span><span style='"MS Mincho"'>level, 
  that would have shocked people in Vadamaratchi. EPRLF leadership in </span><span style='"MS Mincho"'>Mannar 
  town had succeeded in presenting a fairly acceptable image. One purpose of the 
  attack may have been to change the atmosphere, as had been 80 easily done in 
  Vadamaratchi with the killing of just two soldiers on lst June 1988. If that 
  was a purpose of the attack, it bore no immediate fruit.</span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"MS Mincho"'>After the dark winter of 1987, 
  when civilian institutions reasserted themselves, there had been a general demand 
  to the IPKF to keep out of public institutions -particularly educational institutions 
  and hospitals.Such demands had been won and had been grudgingly granted in instances 
  where the IPKF feared a genuine security threat. Sometimes the IPKF had sought 
  assurances from the institutions that the LTTE would not use them. Institutional 
  heads who were in no position to give such guarantees had to argue that prudence 
  demanded that such a risk had to be taken by a force wanting to restore democracy. 
  In some cases assurances were sought from the LTTE and were given, if only tactically.</span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>The sanctity of hospitals is guaranteed by international 
  covenants even during wartime and a hospital is a place from which the IPKF 
  would have least expected to be attacked. The IPKF had probably agreed not to 
  enter hospital buildings. For if regular inside checks were done, such an attack 
  would not have been possible. In conducting such an attack, the LTTE has not 
  just undermined its own credibility, but the credibility of the entire Tamil 
  civilian population engaged in .an uphill struggle to regain a measure of control 
  over their own institutions. That is precisely something that should have the 
  whole-hearted backing of a liberation group. Anyone who is using an adversary&#146;s 
  show of decency to attack him is bent on a destructive course.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"MS Mincho"'>Avarangal is situated. 8 miles

  at Yakkarai. On lOth May there was a troop changeover. The 4<sup>th</sup> Maha 
  moved out and the 2<sup>nd</sup> Rajasthan moved in.</span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"MS Mincho"'>On the 15<sup>th</sup> at 5.3Op.m 
  the LTTE fired at an IPKF patrol, killing Captian N.K.Singh and a trooper. There 
  were no reprisals that day. The 16<sup>th</sup> morning saw what appeared to 
  be a planned onslaught, aimed at driving terror into the civilian population. 
  Troops set out from the camp at Atchuveli beating whomsoever they found on the 
  road, moving towards Avarangal, encircling the area with the help of troops 
  from Puttur. The troops from Atchuveli subsequently apprehended Ponnar Kanthasamy 
  (19) and Sinnathamby Kanagalingam (22), both newly married labourers with infants&#148;, 
  and took them to a vineyard. The two were shot dead later. S. Ratna, (45) of 
  Puttur West had just reached home, when troops arrived and ordered him to open 
  the house for a search. The house being locked and the wife not at home, Ratnam 
  asked leave to find his wife and obtain the key. He was shot dead as he walked 
  away.</span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"MS Mincho"'>On finding out that they were in 
  the middle of a military operation, 6 young men, mostly labourers, parked their 
  bicycles and took refuge at the Mangauna Vairavar temple. They were detained 
  by troops arriving there and were badly beaten. Troops then took them to the 
  main road at Avarangal, stopped a Jaffna bound CTB bus and ordered the six to 
  board the bus. </span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"MS Mincho"'>A passenger in the bus. post master 
  at Chankanai protested strongly about the treatment meted out to the six detainees. 
  reminding the troops that they were part of a Peace Keeping Force. A soldier 
  opened fire. killing the Post Master and injuring a lady nearby. The others 
  in the bus were asked to report that the LTTE had fired at the bus. The Uthayan 
  newspaper reported that the post master was killed when a soldier&#146;s gun 
  went off accidentally. The bus was ordered to proceed and the six labourers 
  were off loaded at the Puttur IPKF camp, situated at the junction of the Chavakachcheri 
  Road.</span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"MS Mincho"'>Between 1.00 and 2.00 p.m, soldiers 
  from the Puttur IPKF camp assaulted several people in the area. Those assaulted 
  included 8 young women from a nearby factory and 5 pregnant women attending 
  a pre-natal clinic near the army camp, on the Chavakachcheri Road-. Subsequently, 
  a lorry from Avanrangal proceeding to Jaffna was stopped at the Puttur camp 
  and 3 young labourers who were to load the lorry before its journey to Colombo 
  were detained.</span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"MS Mincho"'>On the loth evening, Rathimohan, 
  one amongst the group of 6 detained earlier that day, was taken to the house 
  of Krishnarajah from whom he asked for a bag and a grenade allegedly given to 
  him earlier. According to local residents, Rathimohan had no militant connections 
  and had made a fake confession under torture. Krishnarajah&#146;s house was 
  later burnt by Indian troops.</span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"MS Mincho"'>Of the three young labourers, who 
  were detained at the IPKF, Puttur camp. the bodies of Ponnuthurai Vamadevan 
  (20) of Avarangal and Selliah Sivalingam (22) of Puttur West, were given to 
  relatives the following (17<sup>th</sup>) morning, with instructions to cremate 
  them within an hour. Those who saw the bodies which were twisted fractured and 
  punctured with bullet wounds said that they had seen nothing like that before.</span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"MS Mincho"'>Troops went to the house of Thillayarkanagu 
  on the 17<sup>th</sup> night and asked for his daughter Chandradevi (Latha)(17). 
  The girl not being at home the father was badly assaulted. Chandradevi was arrested 
  from a neighbouring house the following morning. Thillayarkanagu went to the 
  Puttur camp with some local citizens on the 18<sup>th</sup> evening to inquire 
  about the fate of his daughter. He collapsed and died a few yards away from 
  the camp. Chandradevi is now reported to be at the KKS detention centre.</span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>Two 0f the group of 6 detained on the i6th were taken by 
  troops to a banana plantation on the 18<sup>th</sup> morning where they had 
  apparently confessed to having hidden arms. They were badly beaten when these 
  arms were not forthcoming. According to locals. these six had no connections 
  with the LITE.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"MS Mincho"'>Indian troops surrounded Vakaraivattai 
  on the 22<sup>nd</sup> morning and took away Ihuraisingam Uthayakumar, who was

<p class=MsoListContinue><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman";"MS Mincho"'>A

<p class=MsoBodyText>The day was still to begin when men clad in army uniform 
  were stealthily surrounding the village of Kandikkadu near the Thakaram Pillayar 
  Kovil, somewhere between Puttur and Vaharawathai. The previous night information 
  that three LTTE cadres were passing the night in a hut belonging to a person 
  living next to the temple had reached the army (IPKF). The same day at about 
  5.30 a.m. five persons from Vaharawathai were coming towards Puttur to load 
  sand needed for construction into a lorry. They were all daily wage earners 
  with families to support and were each carrying a parcel consisting probably 
  of their tools and midday meal. On suspicion they were ordered to get down from 
  their bicycles and squat on the ground. A salesman working at the Atchuvelly 
  Multipurpose Co-operative society was also detained at that spot. A few minutes 
  later two men, their wives, sisters and children were beaten up by the army 
  who were searching their houses and were asked to sit alongside the others. 
  The women sat apart and were pleading with the army officers not to harm them.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"MS Mincho"'>The searching continued until an 
  army officer stooping at the doorway to enter a low roofed house was gunned 
  down by the inmates at that time. The shots rang out clearly reaching the wr,ole 
  village which was beseiged by terror. The inquiring look on the faces of the 
  army personnel turned to fury when they learnt that it was an officer (name 
  not known) who was killed. Instantly they turned their guns on the eight men 
  who were clueless as to the happenings of the day. Three thatch-roofed houses 
  were set ablaze and the women were beaten with guns and bat ton charged. A nineteen 
  year old boy Jeychanthiran whho was trying to flee to safety was asked to carry 
  the </span><span style='"MS Mincho"'>dead bodies&#148; of eight men and dump 
  them into the burning houses. After this</span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"MS Mincho"'>act he too was about and thrown

  later that 3 LTTE cadres. Esco ( who had apparently shot at the officer) Sivaneswaran 
  (alias Nehru) and Jeevakumar (Kutti) had run,through the back door towards the
