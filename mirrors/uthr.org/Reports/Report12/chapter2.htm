<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:
12.0pt;'><u1:p></u1:p> The Sri Lankan army's momentous set back at Pooneryn 
  on 11th November is likely to be analysed and commented upon for several weeks. 
  Early estimates of causalities placed the dead at about 400 on each side. A 
  revealing aspect of the incident will be largely glossed over. The Sunday Times 
  Defence Correspondent quoting `Senior officials' gave it passing mention in 
  his report of 14th November 1993:<b> &quot;Among those who were caught up in 
  the attack at Pooneryn were a large group of soldiers who were in training.</b> 
  <b>Instead of being sent to camps which were specifically designed for training 
  purposes, the new recruits had been sent to Pooneryn to prevent any possible 
  dissertations. Escape from there would have been only into enemy hands.&quot; 
  </b>Captain Priyal De Soysa, a survivor, told the `Island' (19th November) that 
  <b>most of those killed were new recruits</b>. They had arrived in Pooneryn 
  shortly before the eve of the attack.<u1:p></u1:p></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:
12.0pt;'><u1:p></u1:p> With desertion having become endemic, talk of such 
  extreme measures with new recruits had been in the grape vine for sometime. 
  We put them down to after-liquor droppings. Other suggestions were even wilder. 
  But now the incredible has taken place. Such cruel and irresponsible decisions, 
  which in a crisis would adversely affect experienced soldiers, are no doubt 

  being ultimately justified in the name of national sovereignty. In the name 
  of saving the Sinhalese nation, the weaker sections of Sinhalese society are 
  being ripped apart. [See <b>Special Report No.5 and 1.5 &amp; 3.3 of this report</b>]. 
  These inflictions on the Sinhalese themselves result from a refusal by the leadership 
  to face upto the pertinent questions concerning its responsibilities, particularly 
  to admit its errors and look carefully at the political options. On the one 
  hand are young men and women on both sides who are giving their lives willingly 
  and unwillingly for ill-defined causes. On the other is the rank opportunism 
  of leaders whose decisions on key issues are based on utterly contemptible considerations. 
  [See the `Counterpoint' of September 1993 on the Impeachment Crisis].<u1:p></u1:p></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:
12.0pt;'><u1:p></u1:p> Six months ago when two key political leaders<b> Lalith 
  Athulathmudali</b> and <b>President Premadasa</b> were assassinated, such was 
  the moral turpitude with which people credited their leaders that no possibility 
  was ruled out in after-dinner discussions. If the leaders said one thing, the 
  opposite was deemed more probable. In scouring the state media for information, 
  people were being trained in the application of logical negation. Upon the assassination 
  of <b>Lalith Athulathmudali</b>, so many questions about the conduct of the 
  police were raised that<b> President Premadasa</b> felt impelled to call in 
  Scotland Yard to restore a measure of calm. Following the murder of<b> President 
  Premadasa</b>, for which an <b>LTTE</b> bomber is suspected, the press which 
  once, if not lately, poured adulation upon him, became relatively unrestrained 
  about his misuse of power. There was the glimmer of a hint, that the so called 
  separatist and terrorist <b>LTTE</b> had helped to usher in some overdue reforms, 
  which both <b>President Premadasa's</b> party, the UNP, and the opposition had 
  been incapable of securing. That the abuses of the<b> Premadasa government</b> 
  were none other than a continuation of the pernicious legacy of his predecessor 
  <b>J.R.Jayawardene</b>,now widely acclaimed a statesman, was being too easily 
  forgotten.<u1:p></u1:p></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:
12.0pt;'><span></span>  <u1:p></u1:p><span> </span>Among the most graphic 
  parodies of sovereignty are the tens of thousands of houses of Tamils and Muslims 
  in the Trincomalee District wantonly destroyed with explosives or bull-dozed 
  by the Sri Lankan army, in support of a political ideology. Now foreign donors 
  are being asked to contribute towards rehabilitation of the victims and the 
  rebuilding of their houses. <b>A sovereign nation is like an adult. What does 
  one make of a person who burns his roof and sits in the rain asking his neighbours 
  to repair it?</b><u1:p></u1:p></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:
12.0pt;'><u1:p></u1:p> Neither the Commonwealth Commission of Inquiry into 
  <b>General Kobbekaduwa'</b>s death nor the New Scotland Yard Inquiry into <b>Lalith 
  Athulathmudali'</b>s death helped to deflect suspicions the people had about 
  the government. It was rather the inquirers who came in for suspicion. A group 
  of eminent lawyers in this country published an inquiry into the Scotland Yard 
  report questioning many of its presumptions about the local scene,selectivity 
  regarding available evidence and its forensic conclusions(<b>Sunday Island</b> 
  22nd Aug.1993).<u1:p></u1:p></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:
12.0pt;'><u1:p></u1:p> Nor were matters helped by the government's outrageous 
  action of buying, as it were, the silence of<b> Udugampola,</b> former DIG, 
  Police, who had previously made allegations about officially inspired killings.<u1:p></u1:p></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:
12.0pt;'><u1:p></u1:p> Against this background of the country being on the 
  threshold of disintegration some urgent statesmanship was called for. <b>President 
  Premadasa'</b>s successor chose instead to queer the pitch further with a declaration 
  that there was no ethnic problem, but only at terrorist problem. Sentiments 
  with a similar belligerent drift were echoed by<b> Mrs. Bandaranaike,</b> leader 
  of the opposition. To the minorities, no doubt, this would once more drive home 
  the message that the leaders of the Sinhalese polity, despite much that has 
  happened, have refused to grow up since the 50s. While the reality has changed, 
  these leaders thrive on the chauvinistic sentiment that emerged in the wake 
  of the Sinhala Only Act of 1956 and the UNP's infamous Kandy March to scuttle 

  the<b> Banda - Chelva Pact</b>. These leaders are not thinking of the effect 
  of such belligerence on war - weary Tamil youth, who already feel up against 
  a wall. Nor do they think how it would lend further legitimacy to a force, that 
  could give new meaning to helpless and marginalised Tamil youth, by motivating 
  them to turn themselves into human bombs, while fully exploiting the corruption 
  and incoherence within the Sinhalese polity. Nor are these leaders thinking 
  of the Sinhalese counterparts of these Tamil youth serving on the frontlines, 
  for whom life is bound to become increasingly frustrating and hazardous because 
  of their utterances. <u1:p><span lang=EN-GB style='letter-spacing:

<h3><a name="_Toc516068234"><span lang=EN-GB><u1:p></u1:p>2.2 Running with the 
  Hare and Hunting with the Hounds.<u1:p></u1:p></span></a></h3>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:
12.0pt;'><u1:p></u1:p> We are nevertheless assured by political analysts that 
  the government and the opposition are committed to a federal solution to the 
  ethnic crisis and may even be talking to the <b>LTTE</b>. The belligerence they 
  say is a cosmetic exercise, the sugar coating, as it were,on the pill to be 
  swallowed by the Sinhalese masses. This is believable. An insolvent government, 
  critically dependent on foreign donors cannot ward off repeated, well placed 
  international pressure calling for a federal solution, without some cosmetic 
  compliance. We have repeatedly held that such exercises in fooling the Sinhalese 
  people and the Tamil people at the same time have never worked from the 50s 
  and never will in the future. All the signs are that the Sinhalese people having 
  themselves experienced the tragic consequences of state ideology, are far more 
  mature and receptive than their intelligentsia. They also have a shrewd understanding 
  about the real position of this country.<u1:p></u1:p></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:
12.0pt;'><u1:p></u1:p> But even after all this tragedy when the government 
  and opposition refuse to take responsibility and confront the Sinhalese-supremacist 
  ideology that is at the root of the problem, but rather feed it, the mischief 
  continues. As long as the Sinhalese polity continues to be so destructively 
  predictable, the <b>LTTE</b> whether militarily beaten or not , will not be 
  the last word on minority insurrection.<u1:p></u1:p></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:
12.0pt;'><u1:p></u1:p> No less disturbing are groups like the Jathika Chintanaya 
  with a pan-Sinhalese appeal. These thrive on the destructive nationalism legitimised 
  by the government, while exploiting the necessarily widening gap between its 
  rhetoric and the prevailing reality. These groups with intellectual pretensions 
  identify the terror of the state only as relating to Sinhalese youth. When it 
  comes to helpless Tamil civilians confronted with the wrath of the same state, 
  they would wantonly turn a blind eye. Indeed, in relation to the Tamils they 
  willingly consume entire lies propagated by the same state they claim to be 
  at odds with. They even go further and often feel angry that the state is too

  sense of economic frustration and cultural dislocation experienced by the ordinary 
  Sinhalese masses. These come from the government's policies which have led 
  to Western dominance over the economy. Groups like Jathika Chintanaya therefore 
  accuse the government of being an agent of Western Imperialism- notwithstanding 
  the fact that the war which they advocate, and now costing in effect more than 
  25% of the budget, is the single largest factor shackling the country. While 
  accusing the British of having divided and ruled in pursuit of imperial aims, 
  their pedantry thrives on perpetuating the same divisions that shakle the country 
  to foreign interests. The anti - imperialist utterances of these Jathika Chintanaya 
  - type intellectuals, amount to therefore mere trivial rhetoric, and rhetoric 
  alone. <u1:p></u1:p></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:
12.0pt;'><u1:p></u1:p> The question is not whether our country has a terrorist 
  problem or an ethnic problem. The whole problem cannot be looked at in this 
  simplified manner. We, in our reports, have continually brought out the terrorist 
  nature of both the state and the <b>LTTE</b>. There is indeed a terrorist problem. 
  But it does not exist for its own sake. Unless we can dynamically grasp all 
  the aspects which lead to the present crisis and of the forces which are determining 
  the evolution of this crisis in a particular manner, we too will remain impotent. 
  We will continue to sacrifice the flower of our youth from both the Sinhalese 
  and Tamil communities for many more generations. We do not simplify the issue 
  and say that the <b>LTTE</b> is a mere outcome of state oppression alone and 
  if we remove the latter, it will go away. As the state has its own fully fledged 
  ideology and a history which it is unable to break with, the Tamil militant 
  struggle, although it emerges as a response to state oppression, has its own 
  ideology and history. <b>The evolution of the Tamil struggle in this particular 
  context had taken a direction in which terror become a major component of 
  its articulation.</b> The <b>LTTE</b> which now dominates the Tamil political 
  scene derives its legitimacy in part by exposing the bankruptcy of the Sri 
  Lankan state and its associated Southern polity. In the process of its evolution 
  it gained momentum by establishing its links with overt and covert international 
  agencies. Internally it has created an environment which enables it to keep 
  the people as hostages to its ideology and control. Not to understand this reality 
  and ignore the whole problem of the ordinary people and their fears is foolishness 
  in the extreme.<u1:p><span lang=EN-GB style='letter-spacing:

<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:

lang=EN-GB style='letter-spacing:-.15pt;'>We have drawn attention to the need 
  for convincing protective structures since the issue of <b>Report No. 4</b> 
  in August 1990. Although deaths are fewer now, the reality now as transpires 
  in this and the previous report, is that people have no appeal against actions 
  of the armed forces, the civil authorities and even against the well known routine 
  corruption the refugees have to bear with.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:
12.0pt;'><span> </span>The political implications of this state of affairs 
  are extremely grave. In village after village in the East we have talked to 
  literally hundreds of persons, most of them one time refugees. If there was 
  jungle close to their village, thither they fled as the Sri Lankan forces advanced,as 
  is still done in the Batticaloa District. There they remained for weeks and 
  months with wild beasts, snakes, illness and hunger as their companions. Looking 
  back over their experience they feel right to have done so. Not only did the 
  Sri Lankan forces kill upon entry, people were even taken from refugee camps, 
  many of whom then disappeared.<u1:p></u1:p></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:
12.0pt;'><u1:p></u1:p> This resulted from the government fraternising with 
  the <b>LTTE</b> and then being embroiled in a war where both sides had ensured 
  that there was no independent structure to look after the interests of the people. 
  Nor was the government seriously interested in one as many local citizens' groups 
  would testify. Where a structure was established through independent initiative, 
  such as the Eastern University refugee camp, people flocked to it. [<b>Chapter 
  4, <a href="..\Report7\Report7.htm">Report No 7</a></b>]. The <b>LTTE</b> lost 
  little time in expressing its displeasure. Between the Sri Lankan army and the 
  <b>LTTE</b>, they destroyed this promising structure. Life for it became impossible 
  after the detention by the army and disappearance of more than 150 refugees 
  in September 1990. Thousands of refugees, given no other choice by the <b>LTTE</b>, 
  fled the Eastern University into the jungles, where the forces bombed them but 
  could not touch them otherwise.<u1:p></u1:p></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:
12.0pt;'><u1:p></u1:p> Every time they fled into the jungle from the mid - 
  80s, one message stayed with them. That is, their lives were spared because 
  the armed militants prevented, or rather made it too costly, for the Sri Lankan 
  army to come into the jungles. Everything else the army did only strengthened 
  this impression. Any reader could work out the political consequences of this.<u1:p><span lang=EN-GB style='letter-spacing:

<h3><a name="_Toc516068236"><span lang=EN-GB><u1:p></u1:p>2.4 Some Issues of Press 
  Coverage</span></a></h3>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:
12.0pt;'><u1:p></u1:p> The mainline press must assume a significant share 
  of the responsibility for blocking a rational appraisal of the ethinic crisis 
  as well as for the State's military debacles. Having backed to the hilt<b> President 
  Wijetunge's</b> position that the war is about what is exclusively a terrorist 
  problem, the editorials of some of these papers have sounded a note of impatience 
  about the lack of military progress. The consequences of acts of terror by the 
  government are not even acknowledged. Some editorials, which list out only the 
  crimes of the other side in support of a mooted course of action, are as though 
  pulled out of the <b>LTTE</b> press with the villains and heroes transposed. 
  Such have compounded official bombast. <u1:p></u1:p></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:
12.0pt;'><u1:p></u1:p> Even conceptual problems intimately impinging on the 
  welfare of Sinhalese society are not addressed. By pushing the army towards 
  untenable goals, raw recruits have been sent to frontline positions. The press 
  and elite sentiment have thus conspired to send these youths from essentially 
  disillusioned sections of Sinhalese society into a death trap, without assuming 
  any responsibility on their part. <u1:p></u1:p></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:
12.0pt;'><u1:p></u1:p> During many army massacres of Tamils during the course 
  of the war, people were indiscriminately killed just because they were Tamils. 
  In village after village those killed included women and children, like what 
  the <b>LTTE</b> did in several Muslim and Sinhalese villages. An essential part 
  of combatting the <b>LTTE</b> is to counter the Tamil peoples'experience that 
  they were often targetted collectively as an ethnic group.To describe the task 
  purely as fighting terrorism is thus a dangerous misconception perpetuated by 
  the press.<u1:p></u1:p></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:
12.0pt;'><u1:p></u1:p> An attempt to deny the <b>LTTE</b> movement across 
  the Jaffna Lagoon through a policy of effectively shooting at civilian traffic, 
  was seen as conceptually flawed by concerned Southerners. [See the <b>Civil 
  Rights Movement's</b> statement on the subject]. But the press either actively 
  or by default supported the government's position which ultimately brought about 
  the Pooneryn disaster. Some lucid thinking on the subject came from former Air 
  Force chief, Air Vice Marshal <b>Harry Gunathileka</b> in an interview with 
  the <b>`Counterpoint'</b>(October 1993):<i> &quot;The<b> UNHCR</b> saw the claims 

  of the Tamil people as a legitimate claim to move up and down... I think that 
  this is wrong to prevent movement of civilian traffic, human bodies, from the 
  mainland to the Jaffna peninsula and vice versa. Of course you can have searches 
  and that kind of thing. But to totally stop it is wrong, that is why the battle 
  for Kilali...why the hell did you go on an operation to Kilali in the first 
  place if you can't hold it or if you are going to withdraw?&quot;</i> Such opinions 
  are usually to be found only in the alternative media.<u1:p></u1:p></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:
12.0pt;'><u1:p></u1:p> Correspondents who write on defence-related matters 
  often get into a relationship of mutal dependence with sections of the forces 
  that leak information to them. Maintaininng objectivity then becomes a difficult 
  task. When countervailing opinion is kept out as a matter of policy, it is very 
  easy for such correspondents to slip and become apologists for the methods of 
  a section of the state.<u1:p></u1:p></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:
12.0pt;'><u1:p></u1:p> Writing in the second part of a series on the <b>`Black 
  Tigers</b>' in the<b> `Sunday Island'</b> of 14th November 1993,<b> `Ravana'</b> 
  says: &quot;<i>Many weakly motivated <b>LTTE</b> cadre who had been dispatched 
  on suicide missions have been arrested and executed by law enforcement officers 
  even without the knowledge of their superiors. This has been to prevent those 
  arrested from being sent to an ordinary prison where a person can communicate 
  to others and also expect freedom either by escaping or through a loophole in 
  the law. This strategy has been adopted by young officers because the Sri Lankan 
  legal system is still archaic and does not support the type of war the State 
  is fighting. This is a serious matter for debate and study....&quot;</i><u1:p></u1:p></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:
12.0pt;'><span> </span>The writer makes his context clear later in the piece:<i> 
  &quot;The intelligence operative who was to be killed (by an apprehended Black 
  Tiger) had distinguished himself for training and leading small teams in the 
  East where the <b>LTTE</b> was strong. The success of this intelligence officer 
  operating under the name of Moonas in apprehending or killing several key <b>LTTE</b> 
  leaders with the support of <b>LTTE</b> deserters is what had hurt the <b>LTTE</b> 
  most.....&quot;.</i><u1:p></u1:p></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:
12.0pt;'><u1:p></u1:p> The claim that certain <b>LTTE</b> suspects are eliminated 
  because of the inadequacies of the law in supporting security needs is truly 
  astounding. Over the last 15 years a number of provisions have been introduced 
  under the PTA and ER to virtually legitimise murder. Is it the writer's complaint 
  that the laws allow for execution but not for indefnite detention? Even senior 
  public servants have been arbitrarily detained for 4 years and released, but 
  not under legal compulsion. Curiously,<b> Ravana</b> claims that the <b>LTTE</b> 
  dispatched an assasin to Colombo to eliminate <b>Munas</b> who is said to be 
  based in Jaffna and Batticaloa, and whose movements are naturally undisclosed.<u1:p></u1:p></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:
12.0pt;'><u1:p></u1:p> As for <b>Munas</b>, the <b>HRTF</b> report of 29th 
  September 1993 names 4 officers as being identified among those responsible 
  for the disappearance of 158 persons taken from the Eastern University refugee 
  camp on 5th September 1990.They are<b>: 1.Captain Kaluaratchi, Chenkalady Army 
  Camp, 2.Captain Mohamed Munas (Real name Dias Richard), NIB, Batticaloa, 3.Major 
  Majeed, CO, Vallaichenai AC, 4.Major Mohan Silva, Batticaloa.</b><u1:p></u1:p></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:
12.0pt;'><u1:p></u1:p> The <b>HRTF</b> report says in connection with the 
  Eastern University disappearances,<b> &quot;...Masquerading as Captain Munas 
  he was the bane and terror of the defenceless inhabitants of Batticaloa during 
  the period.</b>&quot; The report records a series of admissions and denials 
  of custody by state bodies. An SLBC broadcast on 7-9-1990 admitted the custody 
  of 148 persons. The report adds:<b> &quot;This incident is a dastardly crime 
  which cries aloud for a proper investigation.&quot; <u1:p></u1:p></b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:
12.0pt;'><u1:p></u1:p> During a presentation of the report to<b> President 
  Wijetunge</b> by Justice <b>JFA Soza</b>, the former congratulated the latter 
  on the work of the <b>HRTF</b>. Thereafter the government and the press have 
  been quick to forget the recommendations of the report.<u1:p></u1:p></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:
12.0pt;'><u1:p></u1:p> Could, as <b>Ravana</b> seems to suggest, the `execution' 
  of thousands of Tamils as `suspected Tigers' be simply trivialised in terms 
  of the `archaic' nature of the law? It is a vastly greater issue and demands 
  open discussion as a matter of public interest. Apart from being a moral issue, 
  it should also be a military concern. How else could one account for the massive 
  recruitment by the <b>LTTE</b> after June 1990 and the ensuing humiliation of 
  the Sri Lankan forces? The matter is too important to be left to the peculiar 
  expertise of defence analysts in the mainline press. <span lang=EN-GB style='letter-spacing:
