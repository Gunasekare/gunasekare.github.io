  ILLAM-TRINCOMALEE</span></h2>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:
12.0pt;'><span
lang=EN-GB style='letter-spacing:-.15pt;'><u1:p></u1:p>The story of <b>Anbu Illam</b> 
  (Dwelling Place of Love) is among the most remarkable tales of humanity amidst 
  the gloom of war. <b>Suntharalingam</b> was a middle - ranking official in Nilaveli 
  in 1985, by which time the tumult had resulted in much loss of life in the district. 
  It fell to him to determine the future disposition of 27 young orphans. After 
  being processed by the normal state machinery, he was asked to send them to 
  the Nuwara- Eliya Children's Farm. The village children feeling apprehensive 
  about leaving known people and known places asked if they could not stay thereabouts. 
  <b>Suntharalingam</b> who had hitherto treated the matter as one of his routine 
  duties was taken aback by what struck him as a slap on the face. He in his fifties 
  had been through much that was good and evil in this world and was approaching 
  old age - a time everyone hopes would be one of ease and reflection. He saw 
  the younger generation, coming into a more uncertain world, knocking on his 
  door and entreating him. There was little he could do for them and felt condemned 
  if he did not do what he could. He and his wife Rasalatchumi, a teacher (now 
  retired), took what may appear a rash decision. They decided to take them all 
  into their home to be raised with their own two sons. The number quickly increased 
  to 45. <b>Suntharalingam</b> said, &quot;<i>As a young man I had come from the 
  backwoods of Mutur with Rs 17/= in my pocket and had over the years acquired 
  rice fields and had done pretty well for myself. We had some means&quot;</i>. 
  To increase his income with a view to providing for the orphans, he spent rupees 
  four and a half lakhs and started 3 shops in Trincomalee.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><u1:p></u1:p> 

  When the <b>IPKF</b> came in 1987, Colonel Raman was at first well-disposed 
  to <b>Anbu Illam</b>. He sometimes came with provisions and <b>Suntharalingam</b> 
  used to tell him, &quot;<i>Give it to the children, and not to me&quot;</i>. 
  As the war between the <b>IPKF</b> and the <b>LTTE</b> wore on, the fact that 
  the <b>LTTE</b> had once been influential in Nilaveli made him an object of 
  suspicion. He was once detained, presumably at Colonel Raman's bidding, and 
  was tied naked for 7 days before being released on the intervention of friends. 
  <u1:p></u1:p></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:
12.0pt;'><b><span
lang=EN-GB style='letter-spacing:-.15pt;'><u1:p></u1:p>Suntharalingam</span></b><span
lang=EN-GB style='letter-spacing:-.15pt;'> was deeply upset by the killings of 
  Vijayanathan and later of <b>Gnanasekaran</b> in September 1989. <b>Suntharalingam</b> 
  composed a poem for <b>Gnanasekeran</b> and he and the children sang the poem 
  in front of every militant camp in Trincomalee. The poem described<b> Gnanasekeran's</b> 
  qualities, the void left by his loss and called upon Lord Konesar to tell them 
  why. <b>Suntharalingam</b> started getting threats from the killer unit known 
  as the 'Mandayan Group' widely associated with the <b>EPRLF</b>. One day, in 
  Nilaveli, he was warned by a mechanic that he was being followed. He loudly 
  said that he was going to Seven Star shop, proceeded as if to go there, and 
  escaped to Trincomalee.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:
12.0pt;'><u1:p></u1:p>He then decided to go to <b>Varatharajaperumal</b>, Chief 
  Minister, NEP, and have it out with him face to face. He explained his position 
  to <b>Varatharajaperumal</b> who listened patiently. The chief Minister impressed 
  him as a man of ability and understanding, not lacking in humanity, who was 
  moved by his story. He offered <b>Suntharalingam</b> rupees one and a half 
  lakhs towards his children. <b>Suntharalingam</b> thanked him for his kind thought 
  and replied, &quot;<i>In this transitory world where men wielding power come 
  and go, if I accept this money from you what would be my position when the dispensation 
  of power changes?&quot;</i> He then asked<b> Varatharajaperumal</b> a direct 
  question, &quot;<i>Why did your party kill Gnanasekeran?&quot;</i> Taken aback 
  <b>Varatharajaperumal</b> replied in embarrassment, &quot;<i>Why, he was one 
  of us&quot;</i>. This was the time the provincial government was dissolving 
  under the onslaught of the <b>LTTE</b> and the Sri Lankan forces, accompanied 
  by a sharp rise in revenge killing. <b>Varatharajaperumal</b> told him finally 
  with a note of concern, &quot;<i>This is a time when men are turning into beasts. 
  It is not good for you to be here. Get yourself to a safe place.&quot;</i><u1:p></u1:p></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:
12.0pt;'><u1:p></u1:p>It is also notable that during some of the last sessions 
  of the North-East Provincial Council about the end of 1989, one member Ratnam 
  had expressed concern about the spate of revenge killings. He said in effect, 
  &quot;<i>People like us come and go and everytime things are turned topsy-turvy. 
  But who is going to look after the ordinary people?&quot;</i>. He made a plea 
  to protect those in the community not directly associated with any side and 
  have a social concern, who alone can guide the people through the coming vicissitudes.<u1:p></u1:p></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:
12.0pt;'><span
lang=EN-GB style='letter-spacing:-.15pt;'><u1:p></u1:p>The <b>Suntharalingam</b>s 
  and the children then moved to Kattaiparichchan in the Mutur area, where his 
  friend Thangathurai, former MP, gave them 5 acres of land. As the war progressed 
  <b>Suntharalingam</b> lost most of his wealth, and the three shops had crashed.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:
12.0pt;'><span
lang=EN-GB style='letter-spacing:-.15pt;'><u1:p></u1:p>Shortly before the June 
  199O war, the <b>LTTE</b> set up a platform near his place and had a meeting 
  in the morning which was addressed by Mahattya, then Deputy Leader, <b>LTTE</b>. 
  Following the meeting Mahattya walked into <b>Anbu Illam</b> and made inquiries. 
  On learning their story he was visibly moved. He hugged some of the children 
  and asked to have breakfast with them - an event which was photographed.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:

12.0pt;'><span
lang=EN-GB style='letter-spacing:-.15pt;'><u1:p></u1:p>A tractor which had been 
  taken by another group fell into the hands of the <b>LTTE</b>. On discovering 
  that it belonged to Suntheralingam they offered to return it to him about 3 
  days before the war of June 199O. He reflected, &quot;<i>True, I was once a 
  wealthy man. But, by this time my desire for wealth had worn off. I lost several 
  lakhs when my house and vehicle in Mutur were destroyed. I felt somewhat deterred 
  from applying for compensation. I told the <b>LTTE</b> men, you keep it for 
  the time being, and return it to me at some convenient time. I think it was 
  God (Konesar) who guided me to take that position. If after the war had broken 
  out word had got around that I retrieved my tractor through the <b>LTTE</b>, 
  it would have meant a lot of trouble.&quot;</i><u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:
12.0pt;'><u1:p></u1:p>About July 199O as the Sri Lankan army moved into the Mutur 
  area, <b>Suntharalingam</b>s and the children betook themselves to the jungles 
  with the village folk. For 47 days they led a tenuous existence sleeping among 
  snakes and wild animals. In late August 199O one girl was bitten by a snake 
  and there was no way of reaching medical assistance. Suntheralingam took a gamble. 
  He went in the morning with all the children and surrendered themselves at the 
  Pachchanoor army camp. Confronted with the unusual event the sentries were hostile 
  and suspicious. When the officer in charge was called, following a few questions, 
  he grasped the reality of the situation. He promptly ordered hot tea and biscuits 
  for the children. Meanwhile, he contacted other camps, stopped the bus to Mutur, 
  and arranged for all to be sent to Trincomalee on the Mutur - Trinco ferry. 
  Suntharelingam said, &quot;<i>That officer was a good human being. But I forgot 
  to ask his name. All I know now is that he was in charge of the Pachchanoor 
  camp in August 199O&quot;</i>.<u1:p></u1:p></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:
12.0pt;'><span
lang=EN-GB style='letter-spacing:-.15pt;'><u1:p></u1:p>In Trincomalee the large 
  family moved into the house of the late Appathurai Chettiar at 167 Central Road, 
  which had upon his last will passed onto the Ramakrishna Mission. It had been 
  a grand house in its time about the turn of the century, with pillars of solid 
  Burma teak, which was now in some state of disrepair. An old slightly damaged 
  picture of the late Chettiar himself, sparely attired as an ascetic distancing 
  himself from ties of the flesh and mourning over the mortal remains of an elder 
  daughter, now hangs near the entrance. Suntharelingam rescued it from the rubbish 
  and had it framed as a mark of respect.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span
lang=EN-GB style='letter-spacing:-.15pt;'>But that was not the end of the troubles 
  of <b>Anbu Illam</b>. Through some quirk of fate, a photograph taken by the 
  <b>LTTE</b> in Kattaiparichchan during Mahattaya's visit to the Illam had fallen 
  into the hands of the Sri Lankan forces. The Illam was surrounded twice in 199O 
  and investigation units tried to take Suntharilingam for questioning. Both times 
  the forces were turned back through demonstrations of protest from the children. 
  The third time Suntheralingam decided to have it out direct. He talked to the 
  officer in charge, believed to hold the rank of a major. The officer said in 
  effect that <b>Suntharalingam</b> was breeding recruits for the Tigers. Suntaralingam 
  explained the alienation of the young and said with some indignation pointing 
  to the children, &quot;<i> On the contrary, these children have been given a 
  home with love and affection, taught the tenets of religion, and are steeped 
  in abiding human values. These hundred children have been saved from a life 
  of destruction and a life with the gun&quot;.</i> He was troubled no more.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:

  pointed to two 18 year old boys who were at his home, and said, &quot;<i> These 
  two boys came from Mutur for a technical college interview. They came with all 
  their documents including identification and interview letters. The army took 
  them and kept them for a week at Plantain Point during which time they were 
  beaten. What message is the government giving our young?&quot;</i><u1:p></u1:p></span></p>

  the war of June 199O, no one went to Koneswaram Temple at Fort Frederick to 
  worship. On the first day of the month of Thai (14th January 1991), the <b>Suntharalingam</b>s 
  and children went to the entrance of the fort and sang Thevarams (devotional 
  hymns). The sentries were stupefied. After some questions the officers were 
  informed. Colonel Saliya Kulatunge, Deputy Commandant, Trincomalee, came and 
  spoke to the them. He was so moved by their story that he could not suppress 
  his tears. Thereafter Koneswaram was open to worshippers.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:

lang=EN-GB style='letter-spacing:-.15pt;'><u1:p></u1:p>Several people in Trincomalee 
  ascribe to Suntheralingam an image tending towards sainthood in the eastern 
  sense. Talking to Suntheralingam , one gets the impression that he is a shrewd 
  man of the world. He learnt about good and evil not through meditation or books, 
  but from the rough and tumble of day to day living. Having been pretty successful, 
  when a crucial challenge was posed, he had responded with his heart. He was 
  sustained by his experience and knowledge of the affairs of men.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:
12.0pt;'><u1:p></u1:p>Although his particular situation obliged him to care for 
  Tamil children from the area who were victims of the war, his personal development 
  has made his humanity very broad and humbling to the listener.His sentiments 
  about the Sinhalese, which would surprise outsiders, are being increasingly 
  echoed by Trincomalee Tamils. Asked what he would regard as a solution to the 
  current crisis he said, <i>&quot; I have seen good and evil in all places, in 
  all peoples and in all forces, whether the <b>IPKF</b>, the Tamil groups or 
  the Sinhalese forces. Anyone with a gun has potential for evil. I would like 
  to see an end to guns.If we could all talk without guns we could do pretty 
  well. The ordinary Sinhalese are not aggressors. Both communities in town have 
  suffered in recent times. A few days ago i was in the market, a place of bitter 
  acrimony in the past. Some Sinhalese market vendors waved at me with a smile 
  and said, &quot; Now that the politicians and big mudalalis (traders) have gone, 
  we can live together as friends.&quot; You go up along the coast. At Kallara 
  you will find migrant Sinhalese fisherfolk. They are poor innocent people. The 
  mudalalis for whom they earn money do not sight the place. It is these innocent 
  people who get hurt in the war. <u1:p></u1:p></i></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:
12.0pt;'><i><u1:p></u1:p>&quot; We Tamils who have lost much should not blame 
  the Sinhalese for everything. It is often more true that we lost something rather 
  than the Sinhalese took. Did the Sinhalese take one inch of temple land by force 
  ? It is rather our lawyers who wrote away temple lands for the money. True, 
  the festive ground at Koneswaram was turned into a parade ground for the army. 
  But sometimes our people going there have behaved shamefully. If it is for their 
  palate, people would go into the market which was unsafe in previous times. 
  But if you ask them to come to Koneswaram they would say it is unsafe. Sometimes 
  the behaviour of our young folk in the precints of Koneswaram was such that 
  even the soldiers were embarrassed. On the other hand, soldiers are often very 
  respectful towards the temple and put much cash into the till. So are the Sinhalese 
  employees of Prima. If we want to use Theerthakari on a festive occasion, the 
  Sinhalese who have temporary huts there would dismantle everything and give 
  us the place spick and span.&quot;<u1:p></u1:p></i></p>

lang=EN-GB style='letter-spacing:-.15pt;'>As to how he manages he said, &quot;<i> 
  It costs Rs 2 25O/= a day to feed the children. This comes from the government 
  in the form of rations for refugees. Other expenses have been met on an ad hoc 
  basis by well wishers. Some of the older girls would be entering university. 
  For the one who will enter this year, money has been pledged by a well -wisher. 
  If I register this home as an orphanage, the government would give each child 
  Rs 15O/- a month. But there would also be interference. I am going on the basis 
  that these are my children in my home. I have so far not turned down any request 
  to bring up a child, where the child had lost both parents or where a similar 
  alternative was not feasible.&quot;</i><u1:p></u1:p></span></p>

  12O children at present. The last 7 taken were bereaved by the Mutur ferry boat 
  disaster of January this year. The majority of the children are girls. The eldest 
  Shanbakadevi (22) is about to start a degree course in comerce at the Eastern 
  University. The youngest is a boy, Dinesh(3), whose father was killed in 199O 
  and whose mother lives in Mulleriya. Suntheralingam's own two sons are completing 
  their school education. Four of the children are studying A Level Arts.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>

  said, &quot;<i> I could ask others to come and help. But too often people come 
  into such things to feather their own nests. I am training some of the older 
  girls to manage the administration and the finances. Hopefully they would take 
  over. But they would then take over a working institution without having gone 
  through the struggle of building it up, and so its character may change. I will 
  keep going in the present manner as long as it is possible&quot;</i>.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
