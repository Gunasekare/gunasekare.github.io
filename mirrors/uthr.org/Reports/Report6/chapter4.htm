<h3>&nbsp; </h3>
<h3><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;<a
name="_Toc515969971">4.1: OPERATION SANTA CLAUS,MANNAR - October 21-November 8th.</a></span></h3>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The onset of the season of give and take 
  appears to have induced the two sides to participate in a combined operation 
  in Mannar island. This was an operation conducted with shopping lists rather 
  than with&nbsp; hit lists. All shoppers were looking for electrical items, jewellery, 

  sarees, motor cycles and bicycles - the minimal necessities of life that have 
  become luxuries in this country. By common understanding, both sides used the 
  currency of the North-East - not Rupees, but Grabits.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;As the first part of the operation, the LTTE 
  looted the Muslims from 21st - 28th October [See Chapter 3]. the Tamils who 
  were heart broken at seeing what happened to the Muslims, soon turned their 
  thoughts to the other group of shoppers, whose arrival was now inevitable. The 
  coastal area was bombarded from air and sea in preparation for the landing, 
  on 1st November. One civilian was killed as the result of this. The LTTE which 
  was itself preparing to leave without waiting to welcome the new arrivals, advised 
  those in town to move towards Sunny Village. A group of civilians on the way 
  to Sunny Village met another group coming from Sunny Village who said that they 
  were coming because the army was going to land there. Both groups stood in confusion 
  in the soaking rain near the hospital, where they had met. Then others came 
  and warned them sternly not to loiter about as the army was coming, and to get 
  into churches and schools.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The army arrived and there were no further 
  civilian causalities. The refugees stayed in their camps for a week. When they 
  got home they found practically every house ransacked with valuable items removed. 
  Items removed included stationary, presumably to inform those at home about 
  the progress of the shopping. Ladies who had Kanchipuram sarees not fashionable 
  in the South, discovered to their happiness that they had a change of clothes. 
  Some were lucky enough to get back their bicycles and motor cycles. The rest 
  of the shopping was shipped to the South. In the end there was some season's 
  cheer all round. The Muslim and Tamil residents could say, &quot;We are thankful 
  that they spared our lives.&quot; The others had the goodies.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;By the end of November no food relief had 
  been brought into Mannar. Quite appropriately, the population had to ply their 
  tummies with drum-sticks (murungaikkai) - the only fruit or vegetable available 
  in Mannar, besides coconuts.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;As things quietened down, a young lady approached 
  a young army officer to obtain permission to travel to Colombo. The officer, 
  in a public relations mood, inquired after her well-being and asked if she was 
  pleased that the operation had been conducted without any loss of life,. The 
  young lady reminded him that the population were now paupers and refugees without 
  even a change of clothes. Feeling embarrassed the officer patiently explained: 
  &quot;You see, I am from a good family whose name is renowned in national sports. 
  Stealing is neither&nbsp; a part of my nature nor upbringing. The first group 
  of soldiers we send on an operation like this are thugs. We are mindful that 
  they may not come back. So we do not place too many restrictions on them. We 
  just tell them to avoid killing civilians. That is the best we could do. If 
  you have any problem, now, do tell us. We will take immediate action.&quot; 
  The officer also informed the lady that 60 swords were&nbsp; recovered from 
  the LTTE office and asked why a liberation group needed swords.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;One does feel sorry for the hopeless plight 
  of such officers. The bankruptcy of both parties is such that to fight this 
  war, each is using sections of its society that are cornered and have few options 
  in life. The LTTE is using children from among the Tamil poor, and the government 
  is using the poor state of the economy to get its recruits. But there is an 
  important difference. After decades of bungling and brutality, the government's 
  task is that much harder and requires character, patience and wisdom. The LTTE 
  is uncertain about its ends, but is very clear about its tactics. Against such 
  clarity attended by the expected success, if the government can only send in 
  this kind of an army, the future of those like the young officer is unenviable. 
  Judging by press reports, there are rumblings within the army.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Looting being an officially sanctioned pattern 
  of army activity is now clearly established. [See our earlier reports]. When 
  the question of compensation for civilian survivors comes up, where will the 
  money come from? From the national defence budget, from the President's National 
  Defence Fund, or will it be put before the Paris aid group meeting in October 
  1991?</span> <br>

  me? asks Ranjan</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>Plantation Industries Minister and State Minister 
  for Defence, Ranjan Wijeratne said yesterday that 'The Island' in its 'verbatim 
  report' of last&nbsp; week's Cabinet, news conference had given an accurate 
  version of what he told journalists in reply to a question why the security 
  forces did not take action to prevent the LTTE from holding a meeting at Valvettuturai. 
  &quot;I said that it could not be done because of the lack of initiative on 
  the part of the forces. The &quot;Daily News&quot; reported it as &quot;lack 
  of ammunition&quot;. &quot;The Island&quot; had it correctly. They give a verbatim 
  report. The &quot;Daily News&quot; put me in a mess. It let me down. &quot;The 
  Island&quot; report was accurate.... it gave it verbatim&quot;, the Minister 
  said.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>When Mr.Wijeratne was asked at yesterday's Cabinet 
  Press briefing about &quot;The Island&quot; report of 30 headless bodies being 

  in Akkaraipattu, the Minister replied, &quot;How is it that &quot;The Island&quot; 
  gets it before I do?&quot; He directed Defence Secretary, Gen. Cyril Ranatunge, 
  who was present at the conference, to make a note of that and submit a report.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp; Investigations conducted revealed that newspaper 
  reports which appeared on 1st Nov. 1990 to the effect that a number of headless 
  bodies of adult males were washed ashore in Akkaraipattu were found to be not, 
  only baseless, but also false and mischievous. The Asst.Govt. Agent of Thambiluvil 
  and Tirukkovil has denied the discovery of any bodies with or without heads. 
  He stated that the Grama Niladari for Vinayagapuram reported that there were 
  no such bodies as reported in the media. The&nbsp; citizens committee for Peace 
  and National harmony, Akkaraipattu South and Thambiluvil state that they were 
  not aware of any such incident. The President of the Federation of Akkaraipattu 
  Mosques found no truth in the allegation.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>The manner of the inquiry is a comment on the state 
  of law and of the judicial process in this country. What happened? As was to 
  be expected, a local security forces official approached leading local citizens 
  and demanded a statement of denial. According to our information, a letter was 
  given to the effect, saying truthfully, that the said number of headless bodies 
  did not appear on any one day. The official came back later saying that he was

<p><br>
  <span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;On 24th January 1991, the Colombo press broke 
  the news of 27 Sinhalese peasants massacred by the LTTE in Maha Oya. The contingent 
  of security forces and home guards guarding a village in the area had apparently 
  left when they were fired upon. The dead consisting 15 children, 7 woman and 
  five men, were buried in a single grave the following day.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;`The Island' said in an editorial comment: 
  &quot;The savage massacre of hapless civilians .... brings into question that 
  infamous organisation's claims to be fighting for rights or freedoms of any 
  kind ....these horrific killings in Maha Oya can only be interpreted as an attempt 
  to fan the flames of ethnic hostility to even fiercer temperatures....&quot;</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The Island and the Colombo press, not through 
  ignorance, missed out important elements in the tragedy. Both the government 
  and the LTTE have been involved in shows of strength through a series of massacres 
  of civilians. We follow from where we left off in earlier reports.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;During the second week of December 1990, 
  the LTTE ambushed an STF vehicle in Panama killing 7 STF men in the first incident 
  of that kind in the STF controlled area. The STF was then escorting Sinhalese 
  students for O.Level examinations.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;According to information&nbsp; made available 
  to us, about 54 Tamils over a wide area were killed by the STF in reprisals. 
  Victims were picked up from Periyanilawanai and Padiruppu. Those picked up at 
  Kallaru included 4 members of one family. Some of those picked up were students 
  going from Kurumanveli to Kalmunai for O.Level examinations. Among those picked 
  up were two teachers. One was from Thurainilawanai and another was Sritharan 
  from Kottaikallaru. Five women from the 37th colony at Palaiadivattai, 5 miles 
  from Vellaveli, were raped by Sinhalese home guards from the 32nd colony, during 
  this period.</span> </p>
<h4><a name="_Toc515969975"><span
style='color:#990000'>4.5 An experience in Eravur during and after the Massacre 
  - August-September 1990:</span></a></h4>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>the man concerned hails from Jaffna and was employed 
  in Eravur. In August the LTTE placed a land mine near his place of work. Fearing 
  normal army reaction, he, and several others with him, took refuge with Muslims. 
  Later the Muslims told them that it was not safe for them because of Muslim 
  home guards armed by the government. They then walked about half an hour and 
  took shelter with some Tamils. That same night (11th) two armed persons whom 

  everyone took to be LTTE cadre, came to that area and asked them to leave, saying 
  that they were going to attack Eravur. They then moved to Chenkaladi. the attack 
  which commenced at 10.30 or 11.00 p.m. went on till the following morning.</span> 

</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Asked why the army did not intervene, he 
  replied that they had been in Chenkaladi only two days and would not have known 
  the area to move out confidently. According to him, &quot;Ranjan Wijeratne came 
  the following day and armed more Muslims and went away. Over the next two days 
  the army went on a rampage at Chenkaladi. Since that time armed Muslims have 
  been killing Tamils who went back to look over their property&quot;.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>According to this man, the local opinion was that 
  the Tigers had conducted the massacre at Eravur, because they were desperate 
  and thought they could create friction between Sinhalese and Muslims. While 
  we do not know enough to comment on this, it is significant, that according 
  to a Muslim source in Eravur, the attackers had spoken&nbsp; Sinhalese!</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;This man and his party then moved into the 
  refugee camp at the Eastern University. Several of them worked with the Red 
  Cross. There were adequate provisions and electricity, and the refugees began 
  to feel comparatively relaxed. This angered the Tigers who came to the camp 
  and accused them of living comfortably while they suffered in the jungle, and 
  left after warning them that they were going to attack Muslims. Thus began the 
  panic stricken exodus from Vantharumoolai into snake infested jungles, starvation 
  and disease.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The man found his way back to Jaffna, where 
  the general belief was that the army had killed the Muslims. The man held his 
  tongue and his life.</span> </p>
<h4><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;<a
name="_Toc515969976">4.6 Recent Developments in the Batticaloa District:</a></span></h4>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;About 17th January, the army commenced an 
  operation in the Vakarai area. Two columns of troops moved into that area, one 
  from Polonnaruwa and one from Batticaloa. According to sources from the area, 
  over 100 civilians who had taken refuge in the jungles were killed during the 
  operation. Most of them were those who had been made to move out from the Eastern 
  University and other refugee camps by the LTTE, last September.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Militant groups operating with the Sri Lankan 
  army are now said to be moving&nbsp; freely around Batticaloa and the phenomenon 
  of revenge killings has again begun. About 5 persons with alleged LTTE connections 
  were killed recently. The severed head of a TELO man was placed before the house 
  of an alleged TELO&nbsp; supporter. A principal from Araipattai, Mr.Nallaratnam, 
  who was involved in peace efforts between the Tamils and Muslims was killed 
  2 months ago.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The lives and the well being of refugees 
  has become a lethal form of political football. Shortly before the September 
  exodus, 158 persons were taken away by the army from the Eastern University 
  refugee camp. The army later admitted having taken 144. It was claimed subsequently 
  that only 32 were taken and that they were all released. (See report by Rita 
  Sebastian, Sunday Times, 4.11.90). None of those said to have been released 
  reached their homes. The LTTE had visited refugee camps. Some have claimed that 
  the disappearances were the cause of the exodus. Other LTTE sources claimed 
  that it instigated the refugee exodus to save them from disappearing. But many 
  others routinely treated LTTE visits and army forays as part of the game they 
  had to survive and gave it&nbsp; little attention. Rather than in terms of cause 
  and effect, this can only be understood in terms of the callousness of the government 
  and the calculating destructiveness of the LTTE.</span> </p>

<h4><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;<a
name="_Toc515969978">4.7.1 Jaffna Report (December 1990):</a></span></h4>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The LTTE's mobilisation of the people, through 
  a mixture of persuasion and coercion, to observe national heroes week, brought 
  about the expected response from government forces, but on a scale lower than 
  expected. Decorations, pandls and public meetings marked the week, beginning 
  21st November. On 20th November Puttalai School, Pt.Pedro was bombed. There 
  were no casualties as it was outside school hours. During the same session, 
  the LTTE office in Pt.Pedro was bombed. The bombs missed the target and damaged 
  nearby houses. The LTTE moved house without difficulty. But neighbouring civilians 
  had to stay in their own houses warily awaiting the second attempt. In Vaddukoddai, 
  a bomb aimed at an LTTE target felled a palmyrah tree. As usual, for those near 
  LTTE establishments the choice was between leaving their houses and risk losing 
  them, and remain, risking the wrath of aerial marauders.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The LTTE overrunning the Mankulam camp resulted 
  in more punitive measures against civilians. Shells fired from land or sea towards 
  an LTTE training area at the end of November injured Mr.R.D.Mylvaganam of Navindil 
  and his servant girl. Mr.Mylvaganam, a retired land office was milking his cow 
  in the morning. Both were treated by the MSF. Another old lady living next to 
  an arms factory in Vadamaratchi was advised to move by relatives who made reference 
  to aerial bombing. The lady replied that she was hardly concerned about the 
  bombers, since the possibility of an accidental explosion next door weighed 
  heavily on her mind.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;On 6th December, a bomber circled Velayuthm 
  school, Pt.Pedro, where slogans marking national heroes week were painted prominently 
  on its wall. Puttalai school had been moved to this school following the former 
  being bombed. Mr.Arulpragasam, a senior teacher of the school and circuit steward 
  of the Methodist Church, who was doing some work inside, had gone out of the 
  school to do some shopping. He was killed, together with 5 others by the bomb(s) 
  which missed the school. Shells fired from Palaly base on the same day, killed 
  an elderly lady in Urumpirai.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The activities by the forces provided an 
  apt setting for the LTTE to campaign on the need to defend the land. Balasingam 
  speaking in Pt.Pedro explained the leader's absence by saying that inspite of 
  his advice to the contrary, the leader felt shy of meeting the people until 
  the goal of Tamil Eelam is realised. Yogi, speaking in Manipay gave his line 
  that there may come a time when all people would have to bear arms. This time 
  in a departure from its earlier stand, the EROS dead were included among the 
  martyrs. This issue had caused verbal friction in 1987.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The emotional climate resulting from these 
  festivities was used to draw in more children to bear arms. A typical event 
  was what took place at Sagara Vidyalayam, Varani in early December. The area 
  leader went to the school with some of his men and made a rousing speech about 
  everyone's obligation to defend the land. 12 children went with the Tigers. 
  When the parents went to the local camp, they were told that the children were 
  not there. It took them 3 days to trace where their children were being held. 
  On going there, 9 children ran into their parents' arms in tears. 3 remained 
  behind.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Visitors to Jaffna coming there after an 
  interval have described the human scene as depressing. Hungry looking people 
  moving from place to place with their meagre belongings, or going about with 
  gunny bags and chits of paper in the hope of obtaining relief.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Again as many sensitive observers have pointed 
  out, whatever the exciting distractions of military ups and downs, the people 
  have lost, perhaps irreversibly. An entire generation of young persons have 
  been variously affected. A large number of persons who were economically self-sufficient 
  and possessed qualities of hard work and honesty, have been driven to grinding 
  poverty. While the effects on the economy in the South are marginal, the effects 
  on the Jaffna farmer are catastrophic. Housewives in the South had to put up 
  with the minor inconvenience of items such as potatoes and onions, normally 
  exported from the North in large quantities, shoot up in price. Owing to a blight 
  in the South potatoes shot up from Rs.28/- to Rs.70/- per kilo. The Jaffna farmer 
  who is unable to export these together with other crops would in Amy cases sell 
  at a loss. Thus there is pressure on a large section of the population to turn 
  to racketeering of one kind or the other in order to survive.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Another irony of the struggle is that the 
  major source of cash inflow has become salaries paid by the adversary to government 
  servants. The economy has to adjust itself so that everyone gets a share. Many 
  in productive work have taken to some vocation that will give them a share of 
  this resource. A common occupation is to hawk goods in short supply at highly 
  inflated prices. Agents make money in charging heavy commissions from cashing 
  salary cheques. With transportation to Colombo disrupted, there are astronomical 
  profits to be made in transportation.&nbsp; On the way villagers and boatmen 
  extort money to help people cross flood waters or to carry the elderly. A large 
  part of the money again finds its way back to Colombo - a considerable part 
  of it into the hands of travel agents constantly getting Tamils across fool-proof 
  barriers in the West.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;There are features of the current war which 
  are common to all wars. Every war has produced its racketeers and arms manufacturers 
  who were amply rewarded for their patriotism. But through the tragedy there 
  also often developed new forms of social organisation, new ideals, a spirit 
  of reconciliation and new institutions to prevent war. In our case every development 
  is negative. The Tamil identity has been obliterated. People trust each other 
  less and love each other less. There is no concerted move to protect those most 
  adversely affected and build social solidarity. Leaders of communities or nations 
  fighting a war where there was a perception of a common cause have even co-opted 
  their political opponents to share in the responsibility of organising services&nbsp; 

  and the people. Instead, here, thousands who felt for the community have been 
  arrested and tortured as traitors. Because it suited their politics, the leaders 
  have actually presided over the community&nbsp; going to pieces and have even 
  played a leading role in the extortion and racketeering. Jaffna is unique in 
  having its law enforcing authority kidnapping people for ransom. In early December 
  a senior professional was kidnapped. The wife who approached the rulers was 
  asked to come back with a certain sum of money. A close relative who then went 
  to them was told, that if the matter dealt with his immediate family they would 
  entertain him. But that this did not concern him. People were being told again 
  and again that loving their neighbour was none of their business. Those who 
  did the contrary were terrorised instead of being rewarded.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;These developments combined with the stifling 
  of any independent thought or organisation has had a devastating effect on character. 
  Literally thousands complain about personal irritations such as the effect of 
  military distractions on their children's education and motorcycles commandeered 
  by the rulers and returned with the kick-start broken. But they do not wish 
  to see the overall tragedy. While describing the fate of other gun carrying 
  children as voluntary, they would bring their own child to Colombo complaining 
  of unhealthy impositions. They would also readily rationalise the fate of `traitors' 
  and Muslims.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;It is not difficult to imagine how these 
  persons would react when they become expatriates - the one safety valve allowed 
  and encouraged by the LTTE. They would look at the struggle sans the personal 
  irritations they had complained about bitterly at home. On the other hand the 
  slogans of the LTTE had been popularised long ago by the now traitorous TULF. 
  The Tamil community appears to be in for a long haul.</span> <br>

<p><br>
  <span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;About 11.00 a.m. on Sunday 20th January, notices 
  were air dropped in the Valvettithurai area asking people to evacuate within 
  48 hours. The bombing however commenced 4 1/2 hours later around 3.30 p.m.&nbsp; 
  4 bombers, 3 Avro transports and 2 helicopters took part in the operation. The 
  coastal area between Urikkadu and Nediakadu was subject to heavy bombing for 
  two hours. It was to be expected that many civilians would have been in Valvettithurai 
  under these conditions. According to reports 8 civilians were killed, and of 
  the 30 injured, 21 were admitted to Manthikai hospital.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;On the 21st VVT, Kokkuvil, Valikamam North, 
  Sirupiddy and Puttur were subject to bombing and heli-straffing. 4 bombers were 
  seen above Kokkuvil and 10 bombs were dropped, about 5.00 p.m. It is not known 
  whether the target was an LTTE camp or the kerosene queue that was on the road. 
  A retired principal, R.Mahadeva, was killed and 7 others injured.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;In the meantime the LTTE issued a notice, 
  addressing the people `who had co-operated with them fully and had inspired 
  them in the armed struggle'. The aerial attack by the Sri Lankan state, it said, 
  was to demoralise the people. The Sri Lankan state, it said, which could not 
  succeed in Mankulam or in the Fort cannot succeed in making any advance or establishing 
  a camp in VVT. It further said, &quot;The whole of North Tamil Eelam is under 
  aerial attack. It is therefore meaningless to seek safety by moving from Vadamaratchi 
  to Thenmaratch or vice versa. In order to defeat your enemy's intentions, please 
  dig bunkers and stay in your own homes.&quot;</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;On the 22nd, two bombs fell in front of Hindu 
  Ladies College, Manipay, one of which exploded. It was 12.30 p.m. when children 
  were in the school compound. It was the third day of bombing at VVT. 6 fire 
  bombs were dropped from a transport at 7.00 a.m. 15 more were dropped in the 
  afternoon. Several buildings were seen burning for hours.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The Eelanadu reported that 5,2000 families 
  from the affected area in Vadamaratchi had sought refuge in Thenmaratchi. The 
  bombing was said to be most intense around the former army camp at VVT. The 
  LTTE bunkers were hardly affected, and their Pasilan cannon were loaded in preparation 
  for an army advance. It appears that the army had delayed its plans.</span> 
  <br>
  &nbsp; </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;In VVT, about 5 schools (including Sithampara 
  and the Roman Catholic school), 4 temples and 500 homes were affected, according 
  to the `Eelanadu'. Among the temples bombed is the famous Athiady Vembadi Pillayar 
  Kovil.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;the situation with regard to essential commodities 
  is very bad in Jaffna. Over a matter of days, rice shot up to Rs.52/- per kilo, 
  and petrol, Rs.400 per bottle (1/6th of a gallon). The situation was becoming 
  so out of control that the Tigers who had previously organised or presided over 
  the black market suddenly imposed price controls. Goods promptly vanished from 
  the shelves. Subsequently the LTTE announced&nbsp; sporadically that it had 
  discovered hoarded goods, which it was to distribute. Crowds which queued for 
  kerosene at Rs.30/- a bottle, often received 1/4 bottle after a long wait. It 
  is expected that there will be severe shortages until the black market is restored 
  to make the smuggling of goods from the South worthwhile. Even then, the prices 
  will be far too high for most people.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;With regard to medicines, the government 
  hospitals, as of 24th January, had satisfactory stocks for the time being. But 
  nothing is available from the shops. At the rate at which people were getting 
  injured, the situation with medicines too may become critical.</span> <br>

<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;A sense of identity was forced on the Tamils 
  through the common experience of state oppression. At the same time there is 
  enormous potential for conflict within Tamil society itself. WE have pointed 
  out that the nature of the current politics, instead of defusing such potential 
  to strengthen the community in the face of state oppression, does the opposite. 

  The ability to recruit and brainwash children from all sections belies the fact 
  that there are deeply felt divisions hidden by the supervening threat of the 
  Sri Lankan army's projected arrival. Parallel trends are also in evidence in 
  the South.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;To understand the deeply felt suspicion with 
  which the LTTE moves in certain parts of Vadamaratchi, one needs to realise 
  that Vadamaratchi is a patchwork of diverse communities and political influences. 
  Karaveddy, covering a sizeable area, forms the agricultural core of Vadamaratchi. 
  Its inhabitants are hard working and are mostly farmers or farm labourers - 
  many of them from the depressed class. The traditional Left was strong in the 
  area and many of its people politically sophisticated. The LTTE did not command 
  a large following there until it wiped out the other groups militarily. To this 
  day, the LTTE is unduly sensitive to both ex-militants from other groups as 
  well as to hints of dissent, which a more mature force would have ignored.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;In May the LTTE looked for Sellathurai Atputhan 
  (20) of Karaveddy North. Being unable to find him, they took his father, mother 
  and wife as hostages.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Sebaratnam Kanthan (21), an EPRLF supporter 
  was arrested in April. He was being held at the LTTE'S detention centre at Karaveddy 
  VC with about 40 to 50 others.</span> </p>

<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Uthayakumar (23), a mill owner from Karaveddy 
  was detained by the LTTE during a night in mid-August. The charge against him 
  was that he had financially helped a friend in the Peravai, a defunct Left group 
  from that area. Uthayakumar is the second of two sons in a family having in 
  addition five daughters.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Kuhathasan (Kuhan) was picked up by the LTTE 
  at Athulamman Kovil, Karaveddy in mid-August. The temple has a well that provides 
  drinking water for the area. As a tradition, people were not meant to keep their 
  footwear on in the temple precincts. Female LTTE cadre used to come in a vehicle 
  to fetch water, and used to keep their boots on, disregarding the tradition. 
  One day the local people put a board requesting users to remove their footwear. 
  The female cadre who came disregard the sign. Some boys who were there drew 
  their attention to the sign. The female cadre ignored them and went away. 10 
  minutes later, LTTE boys arrived in another vehicle and detained 25 bystanders. 
  The parents complained to Selvam, an LTTE intelligence man from that area. 10 
  were released in early September. Up to the end of October, there had been no 
  information about the rest, including Kuhan. On 20th August, an LTTE camp at 
  Kachchi was bombed. The LTTE later claimed that 49 detainees were among those 
  killed. A person well known to an LTTE guard killed during that incident, was 
  asked about the detainees who were killed. He remained silent. After the others 
  in the company had dispersed, he took the inquirer to a side and told him, &quot;I 
  did not want to discuss the subject in front of the women&quot;. He added that 
  it was true that that 49 detainees were killed. But those who died in the bombing 
  were 3 detainees and 2 LTTE guards, he said.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>Thirukumaran (21), son of Rajaratnam and Chandralingam 
  (Chasi) (23), son of Ambalavanar were arrested by the LTTE at Vathiri on 26th 
  October. The arrest was at Irumpumathavady, Vathiri junction. They were charged 
  of talking about the LTTE at the junction. Chasi had been trained locally by 
  the LTTE before the IPKF arrived.</span> <br>

<h4><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;<a
name="_Toc515969981">4.7.4 Public executions and the killings of the detainees:</a></span></h4>
<p><br>
  <span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Vasantha Sulosana aged 39, mother of two children 
  from Navatkiri, Neerveli was executed publicly on the 15th of August by the 
  LTTE. The LTTE accused her of indulging in `financial fraud' using the name 
  of LTTE. This was the first public execution after the IPKF's withdrawal. During 
  the IPKF period, she rendered her help to the LTTE in a number of ways - especially 
  giving food parcels to their camps in her village. It is worth noting that during 
  this period people who used to give them food were subject to severe torture 
  and even death. If the IPKF or the groups in power at that time came to know 
  about this, by all means she would have become a martyr. Thus she had a strong 
  desire to help the LTTE, unmindful of the risk she took at that time. She came 
  from a `well to do' family from the village and she used to help people through 
  natural generosity. According to sources from her village, at times she ran 
  short of money. Then she used to sell her lands to settle the money. This attitude 
  of hers made people feel that she was a little irresponsible. The kith and kin 
  of the detainees who were detained for ransom by the LTTE used to go for her 
  help to mediate their release. While doing this she seems to have collected 
  nearly Rs.90,000/- from various people, without the LTTE's knowledge, and used 
  it for her own purposes. In the first week of July, the LTTE somehow came to 
  know about this and she was taken into custody. Hearing this her uncle sold 
  few of her lands and repaid one lakh to the LTTE. The lady was a heart patient 
  and during her detention she suffered from severe chest pain and was admitted 
  to hospital. But the LTTE did not release her even after that and whenever her 
  sister went to the camp, they promised that she would be released soon.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;On the ill-fated day&nbsp; - 15th August 
  she was brought to &quot;Muthiraisanthai&quot; in a van with a man by the name 
  of Shanmuganathan known as Guru master. According to the LTTE he also had indulged 
  in `financial fraud'. Both of them were blind folded. Around 4 o'clock in the 
  evening both were given the `lamp post punishment'. Vasantha Sulosana became 
  a hapless victim of a woman's gun. Incidentally her daughter's age attainment 
  ceremony was held on the day she was killed. Actually her sister visited her 
  camp on the previous day and requested them to release the mother to attend 
  her daughter's ceremony. The person who was in charge promised to release her 
  the next day. When they were anxiously waiting for her arrival, a van came to 
  her place driven by a woman and her daughter asked the woman who was in the 
  front seat, &quot;Where is my mother?&quot;. The woman in the uniform sarcastically 
  said, &quot;She is coming behind.&quot; The girl was under the impression that 
  their mother was coming by bus and she ran towards the bus stand which is a 
  few yards from their house. But her son who saw his mother's body through the 
  shutter screamed. Immediately the body was pushed out and the van sped away.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;This cruel murder brings out two things revealing 
  the true nature of the LTTE. A woman who took lot of risks and helped them in 

  a period of uncertainty has a strong character of her own. Of course, she has 
  used her contacts with the LTTE which was involved in abducting people and demanding 
  ransom, to gain certain benefits for herself. The LTTE could have disassociated 
  her from them, and could have warned her about her conduct. After she had returned 
  the whole amount of money, the way in which they have killed her shows their 
  brutal bankruptcy.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The people at Muthirai Santhai witnessing 
  the act were really appalled. But there are also people justifying the whole 
  thing. After this there were another 6 to 8 public executions in the Jaffna 
  peninsula alone. In the meantime from September 15 onwards up to 500 names were 
  given out as persons executed by the LTTE, by their Information Centre for&nbsp; 
  detainees. Because of the threat posed to families, it is difficult to get details 
  about the victims. The pattern of events regarding these incidents also brings 
  out certain sadistic features of the episode. The LTTE was keeping a large number 
  of people under detention and parents were never allowed to see them. There 
  are people aged around the 40's who have been taken in just because they had 
  contacts with the IPKF, immediately after the IPKF withdrawal. During IPKF's 
  presence, the people who were residing near the camps became very vulnerable 
  due to IPKF officers' visits to their houses. Those who were arrested allegedly 
  had cordial relationships with IPKF personnel. Nobody knows what type of threat 
  they can pose at this juncture to the LTTE!</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;During the early part of September some of 
  the kith and kin who were regular visitors to the information centre to find 
  out the fate of the beloved ones, were told to fill certain forms and were informed 
  by the people who were in charge that they will release their relatives on September 
  15. When parents, sisters and relatives visited the camps on the 15th, the LTTE 
  started to read out names and&nbsp; said that they had been executed. This went 
  on for a week and the list is said to have contained up to 500 names. Those 
  who went to see the loved ones were told in no uncertain terms that they had 
  been killed. Why did they allow the mothers and relatives to come with hope 
  and suddenly give the cruel news? The people who were there threw stones and 
  sand and cursed the LTTE for their evil deed. According to one eye witness, 
  some mothers vowed to give birth to a new generation of children to fight the 
  Tigers!</span> </p>
<h4><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;<a
name="_Toc515969982">4.7.5 The Army in Fetters:</a></span></h4>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;A senior LTTE figure speaking to a relative 
  of a detainee had said that they were holding 8,000 prisoners, including 2,000 
  women. Whatever the truth, other sources guess that 4,000 would be a minimum. 
  This reflects the spate of arrests during and around September. We have described 
  the conditions under which they were being kept in <a href="\uthrj\Reports\Report5\Report5.htm">Report 
  No.5</a>. All reports [See other reports in this section] suggest that the bulk 
  of the detainees are suspected of political connections, not even necessarily 
  opposed to the LTTE. Some were picked up in Vadamaratchi because they had received 
  leaflets by post from India from former associates of the Peravai. Apparently 
  they were kept under observation and their contacts were noted.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Torture of detainees has been routine. Many 
  had been forced to dig bunkers in dangerous places. A group of persons with 
  heads shaven and chained to each other, digging bunkers near the Kachcheri were 
  identified as EPRLF prisoners. According to the same LTTE spokesman, they do 
  not easily kill people now. But when released these persons cannot move out 
  of a specified area, must report daily to the LTTE and will have to perform 
  jobs assigned to them by the group - generally of a military nature.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;According to the last information we received, 
  the LTTE has routinely ignored ICRC inquiries about its detainees. If it does, 
  it would have to conform to international norms. Any talk about a cease-fire 
  and a democratic process would be meaningless unless this scandal is ended. 
  [It was reported in the Colombo press that the ICRC had visited about 40 policemen 
  held by the LTTE about 9th January 1991].</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;According to other sources, one of the constant 
  fears of a detainee is that if he succumbs to torture, he would be listed as 
  having been killed during aerial bombardment. On one occasion about September 
  a large number of parents of detainees were summoned to a camp in Jaffna. The 
  parents went in anticipation of their sons being released. Then over 100 names 
  were read out as having been killed during bombing. The total number which the 
  LTTE claims to have killed is said to be up to 500.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Parents of detainees usually fear reporting 
  the issue to anyone out of fear for the safety of their child. Those released 
  are enjoined under threat not to talk about their experience under detention. 
  The ICRC is technically meant to help relatives to draw up affidavits about 
  those detained. But fear of informants prevents them from going near the ICRC. 
  By contrast, in the South, reporting detentions to the ICRC has become accepted 
  as routine and useful at times. Thus the fate of the detainees is one where 
  little information is available and people dare not talk about individual cases.</span>

name="_Toc515969983">4.7.6 Injured Women and Children:</a></span></h4>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;A large number of girls and children were 
  recruited and were flung into battle in reckless fashion with little understanding 
  of the purpose and the lack of maturity to come to terms with blown limbs and 
  permanent physical disability. Once the original boyish sense of adventure and 
  evaporated with injury, children often bitterly cursed the movement and even 
  attempted suicide. Others talk about the experience in a dazed matter of fact 
  manner. The two attacks on the Fort and the attack on Mankulam resulted in a 
  large number of such casualties. The LTTE which had evidently not given serious 
  thought earlier to problems of injured women and child cadre, appears to have 
  come up against unforeseen difficulties.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The following were related by eye witnesses. 
  The scene was Manipay hospital just after the attack on Jaffna Fort on 5th August. 
  The ward was full of injured girls. A woman major in military uniform with her 
  hands on her hips walked from bed to bed, mechanically repeating the same thing: 
  &quot;Do not be sad. We will liberate our soil&quot;. Her disposition was totally 
  incongruous with the mood of the injured, writhing in pain. Some had even hesitantly 
  tried to commit suicide with cyanide capsules. One girl with a leg blown off 
  and a slit mouth nonchalantly related her experience: &quot;We surrounded the 
  Fort and announced that unless they surrendered, we would attack in 10 minutes. 
  The planes arrived and we were getting missiles from the air as well as from 
  the Fort. We ran. There was an explosion and I fell down. I tried to move my 
  leg to get up. But nothing happened. I then noticed that my trouser leg was 
  hanging, and my foot was somewhere behind. Then an `anna' (elder brother) carried 
  me. After he went a few paces, there was another explosion. The `anna' who carried 
  me collapsed dead. As I fell, I saw Mathangi. She too was dead. I lay on the 
  ground for 20 minutes while shells flew over me. One exploding shell spit my 
  mouth.....&quot;</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Another girl with a head injury was at Manthikal 
  hospital. The place reeked with blood. The tractor in which her party had been 
  travelling in Karaianagar had caught a shell when they tried to attack the naval 
  base. After being injured as girl held on to her gun as instructed until someone 
  collected it. Asked how she felt before the attack, she said that it was the 
  most exhilarating experience. They were simply thrilled as they had a cup of 
  tea before setting off. Then she became anxious. She asked the lady close by, 
  &quot;Akka (elder sister) will you stay with me tonight?&quot; Later in her 
  sleep she cried, &quot;Amma (mother), amma, come and stay close to me!&quot; 
  Then: &quot;Drive the tractor slowly, my head hurts.... I asked the akka to 
  stay with me, I don't know if she is here.....&quot;</span> </p>

<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Towards the end of the national heroes week 
  celebrations, the families of the martyrs were collected for a ceremony. There 
  was little choice. They were escorted by guards with guns and grenades and taken 
  in vans. They were addressed by the deputy leader Mahattaya renowned for honeyed 
  words: &quot;....It is a great privilege for me to meet you. You have made the 
  immense sacrifice of a member of your family to the cause of liberation. It 
  would have been my great pleasure to have come to you individually. But alas, 
  because of the exigencies of the situation, you had to come to me... We were 
  in a weak position after fighting the Indian army, having lost many of our cadre. 
  So we had to talk to President Premadasa to buy time and build up our strength. 
  Now we are in a strong position to attain our goal..... Only five percent of 
  the people really support us. Because we are now strong, many opportunists are 
  coming after us and are working for us.... You are the link between us and the 
  people. You must help us. You must identify those opportunists and traitors 
  and let us know. You must identify those persons who demean our struggle by 
  spreading lies. Tell us also of those who speak against us...&quot;</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The impression left after the meeting was 
  that rather than wanting to honour them&nbsp; or to assert confidence, it was 
  an admission of weakness and of gnawing inner despair. The exercise was about 
  recruiting informers.</span> <br>

name="_Toc515969985">4.7.8&nbsp; The Hungry Woman:</a></span></h4>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;She was a woman of about 50, A Trincomalee 
  refugee in the Jaffna district. Some younger members of her family were in the 
  LTTE. Her rations had been stopped. On 20th December, she went to the village 
  committee (Sitturavai) to lodge a complaint. Faced with a reluctance to reverse 
  the decision, she had criticised the LTTE. Persons came to her home that night, 
  and asked her to come the following day and that her rations would be issued. 
  When she went the following day, she was sent in turn to 3 LTTE camps and then 
  there was no trace of her. There was no prospect of pursuing the matter because 
  the LTTE said that she had not come, and the boy who had gone with her was refusing 
  to speak. Nothing more had turned up by new year. Such incidents illustrate 
  increasing sensitivity to any criticism, even when the cause was hunger rather 
  than political ideas.</span> <br>

<h4><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;<a
name="_Toc515969986">4.7.9&nbsp; Incident at Kayts:</a></span></h4>
<p><br>
  <span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Three people were killed in a mysterious way 
  in Kayts on the 16th of December 1990. Their bodies were found in a well, tied 
  together with a huge stone, 36 hours after the incident. They were identified 
  as Anthonipillai (75), his wife Theresamma (65) and his sister Elisammah (72). 
  Anthonipillai's boy is said to have been found without any wounds or scars. 
  Both of the women were squeezed to death.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>While the inhabitants of Kayts were fleeing from 
  their places in fear of the Lankan army's retaliation, these three remained 
  in their homes assuming that in any case they won't get harassed because of 
  their age. They seemed to have related this to some of their relatives that 
  the Sri Lankan army and the EPDP had come to their place twice in search of 
  the LTTE and no harm was done. The gruesome killing had brought panic to that 
  area. Why they were killed still remains unanswered. It is worth mentioning 
  here that the area in which the incident took place is about half a mile from 
  the Kayts civil hospital and the area has virtually come under the Sri Lankan 
  army's control after the recent operation against the LTTE. There is an LTTE 
  sentry post situated near the place of the incident.</span> </p>
<h4><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;<a
name="_Toc515969987">4.7.10 Dissent within the LTTE:</a></span></h4>
<p><br>
  <span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;It has been known that members of the LTTE 
  had all sworn an oath of absolute loyalty to the leader and the slightest sign 
  of dissent is ruthlessly rooted out. But members who wish to leave had been 
  allowed to leave provided&nbsp; they are perceived as posing no threat to the 
  organisation. A large number of those who remain, do so with a feeling of discomfort, 
  fearing the world outside as they fear the organisation.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Confessions made to an aunt by an LTTE area 
  leader killed by the IPKF in November 1987 are revealing. His brother who described 
  the deceased as a `lamb' before he joined the organisation, came to know of 
  these confessions later. This area leader was very loyal to the leadership and 
  never questioned their orders. These qualities were put to use. He was occasionally 
  given secret instructions to kill certain comrades in the organisation marked 
  by internal intelligence as having dangerous tendencies. The method often adopted 
  was to get into a conversation with the victim, take him out on a motor bike 
  ride, and do the deed in a lonely place. Having done this several times the 
  area leader felt deeply disturbed&nbsp; and poured out his mind to his aunt. 
  After about a year in the organisation, he developed some maniacal tendencies. 
  He said that when he faced someone he just felt like pulling out his pistol 
  and putting a bullet into the person's head, even into his father's head, just 
  to see how the victims suffered.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;He had also told his aunt that secret instructions 
  had at times been given to trusted individuals to surreptitiously finish off 
  a comrade on the battle field, so as to put the blame on the enemy. This had 
  long been suspected. So much so that whenever a prominent LTTE'er was declared 
  martyred on the battle field, seldom did persons close to the LTTE take it at 
  face value.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>When a close relative of the area leader, an expatriate 
  scientist and a functionary of the LTTE's ROOTE, was told of these confessions, 
  he put it aside as something regrettable. Members of the late area leader's 
  immediate family in London who do not know of these confessions, still faithfully 
  attend LTTE meetings.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;During national Heroes week in November, 
  a street was named after the late leader in his hometown, and the leader, and 
  presumably his victims, were commemorated as martyrs.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Following&nbsp; the IPKF offensive in 1987 
  when the LTTE was disorganised and civilians were hysterical, an order went 
  to area leaders from the top, to kill any civilian protesting against the laying 
  of land mines in his area. Except for Lollo and Mathi, all other leaders are 
  said to have ignored this instruction.&nbsp; Mathi and Lollo were killed about 
  a year later by the IPKF. Lollo's list of individual killings is said to have 
  numbered more than 60. Gamini, an area leader in Nelliady, was sent on punishment 
  transfer after internal intelligence reported him too soft on civilians.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The LTTE spent large resources observing 
  in Jaffna, National Heroes Week last November. This was regarded by the leadership 
  as a tactical necessity. But cadre from the Eastern province, who form the majority, 
  are said to have taken this badly in consideration of the misery in the East. 
  It has been suggested that the reference to the suffering of Tamils in the East 
  in the cease-fire&nbsp; declaration was in deference to this internal development.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Observers with contacts within the LTTE report 
  that a large number wish to leave the organisation, particularly in the 16 to 
  18 age group. One of those who left and went abroad recently was a notorious 
  area leader, mentioned in the landmine incident in UTHR(J) <a href="\uthrj\Reports\Report2\Report2.htm">Report 
  No.2</a>. In that incident he had threatened a man who discovered a landmine 
  next to his house and had consulted a neighbour. He was told that if he had 
  a problem he could quit his house, but it was criminal of him to tip off his 
  neighbours and spoil the planned attack.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;This leader has curious story behind him. 
  His parents were unpopular persons in the village who used to pass comments 
  at other people's children who had not joined the movement. When their own son 
  Ravi joined, they took it badly and went in search of him and pleaded with him, 
  but to no avail. When Ravi returned from training, his sight used to strike 
  terror into the villagers. `He is going to do something. Get ready to run',&nbsp; 
  was a frequent remark. His family was influentially placed in the local Sitturavai 
  (Village Committee). When he left, his parents accompanied him to Colombo to 
  make the travel arrangements.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Another leader who left and went abroad is 
  one who played a prominent role in the assassination attempt on the ENDLF leader 
  in 1987, which led to the death of 4 AOG churchmen.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Those who extol the sacrifice and courage 
  of ordinary LTTE persons, wilfully ignore their internal sufferings. Nor do 
  they acknowledge that they were allowed to real power to determine the movement's 
  direction. They were used. The only power they enjoyed was to kill ordinary 
  civilians and to bring misery to many homes.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;According to those who have been in touch 
  with a number of persons who want to leave, their fear and anxiety is to do 
  with their future. An immediate problem is that if they leave and some informer 
  points them out to incoming Sri Lankan troops, they would almost certainly have 
  a summary death. Supporters of the cause also have a duty towards those who 
  leave.</span> </p>

<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;In early September 1987, 4 AOG men, including 
  2 clergy and 2 lay persons, were shot dead at Uduvil junction at 10.00 p.m. 
  while travelling in a white van. The following day an LTTE loud speaker vehicle 
  went around Chunnakam accusing the traitor groups brought in by the IPKF of 
  killing even Christian clergy. The truth was widely sensed, but few dared to 
  talk about it. The following account was given by an ex-LTTE man who was privy 
  to the facts. &quot;The group led by Kutti Prabha was waiting at Uduvil junction 
  to ambush the ENDLF leader, Rajan, who was expected to come that way in a white 
  van. But unknown to the group, Rajan had already passed. When the van with the 
  clergy came, one of those in the ambush signalled the van to stop. The driver, 
  perhaps excited at seeing the gunman, swerved towards him. Immediately, the 
  order to fire was given. On realising the mistake, Kutti Prabha went to teh 
  top man himself. In anticipation of the IPKF, then in a peace keeping role, 
  coming to examine weapons, they were ordered to clean their weapons and deposit 
  them in different camps&quot;.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The truth usually comes out. But there remains 
  the problem of protecting unarmed individuals&nbsp; who practice freedom in 
  such a vicious atmosphere. The IPKF was negotiating power between armed parties 
  and lacked the sophistication, training or the motivation to protect or even 
  be sensitive to democratic activity at the level of the people. That was one 
  of the key reasons for its failure. Much more imaginative thinking will have 
  to be done to have a monitoring process whose first concern is the unarmed people.</span>

<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp; [From `The Virakesari&quot;, 30th December]</span> 
  <br>
  &nbsp; </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The aftermath of the operation on the Mankulam 
  army camp brought on untold sufferings to the people of Vavuniya and Mullaitivu.&nbsp; 
  In the months of (late) November and (early) December 18 civilians lost their 
  lives in different acts of atrocities including aerial bombing and army in discipline. 
  In the Nedunkerny Mathiamadu district 3 people who were taken away by the army 
  in early December are still reported missing. And, to date, not a single soul 
  knows what fate befell the seven lorry drivers who left for Jaffna from Colombo 
  on the 24th of November. That same day an unidentified armed gang broke into 
  a hamlet in the Vavuniya Thekkankadu district and hacked to death 8 persons 
  including women and children. Aerial bombing and the uncertainties of the time 
  have brought great damage to the economy of the area, notably to cultivation. 
  In the Thanaimurrippu, Kulakattu district the reservoir developed a leak from 
  damage caused to the bund of the dam. This poses a great threat to paddy cultivation. 
  There is much damage caused to building and property not excluding schools, 
  temples and other public institutions. In Mathiamadu, Paranthan and Sannasi 
  areas the homes of several inhabitants were looted prior to attack from the 
  air. The people rendered homeless continue to live with relatives and friends.</span>

name="_Toc515969991">4.9 Calling off the Ceasefire:</a></span></h4>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;In calling off the ceasefire the government 
  put forward the following demands to the LTTE [Daily News 12th January 1991]:</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp; Reiterating the government's commitment 
  to the search for a peaceful solution on the North-East question, the government 
  called upon the LTTE to demonstrate its concern for civilian hardships (resulting 
  from LTTE action) with the following steps:</span> </p>
<p><b><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;* Release all hostages and not take any 
  more of them;</span></b> </p>
<p><b><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;* Stop all torture and execution of all 
  captives and prisoners or</span></b> </p>
<p><b><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;* Stop using civilians in mine-clearing 
  operations;</span></b> </p>
<p><b><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;* Stop recruiting innocent children and 
  innocent citizens for combat;</span></b> </p>

<p><b><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;* Stop all reprisals on civilians;</span></b> 
</p>
<p><b><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;* Stop all acts of terrorisation of civilians 
  as a means of obtaining their support;&nbsp; and</span></b> </p>
<p><b><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;* Allow humanitarian access to all prisoners-of-war.</span></b> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>Coincidentally the demands in their wording and 
  order bore a close resemblance to demands put forward to both sides by the International 
  Alert on 4th January. The IA declaration was received by the government with 
  mixed feelings, particularly because of its reference to a federal solution. 
  It is good to know that the government is capable of learning from those frequently 
  maligned as `human rights do-gooders'. Hopefully, it may in time follow them.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>Significant omissions from the original IA declaration 
  were references to bombing and shelling and food blockades. Had the LTTE responded 
  positively it could have gained in political image. [See Appendix for the IA 
  declaration].</span> </p>
<p><b><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;4.10 The ICRC taken to task:</span></b> 
  <br>
  <span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The following report appeared in the Island 
  of 31 January:</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp; Vehicle with Red Cross markings fire's at 
  copter</span> <br>
  <span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;&nbsp; (By Norman Palihawadana and Shamindra 
  Ferdinando)</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;&nbsp; Air force helicopter on Tuesday morning 
  strafed a vehicle with Red Cross markings in the northern Jaffna peninsula after 
  a group of LTTE terrorists travelling in it allegedly fired at the helicopter 
  with light machine guns and other arms, the Army said yesterday.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;&nbsp; The helicopter was flying from the 
  strategic Palaly base towards Elephant Pass when it `located' a vehicle with 
  Red Cross markings about three miles east of Kodikamam. At that time the vehicle 
  was moving towards Iyakachchi, the Army said.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the vehicle had moved into a 
  coconut plantation and this `action' had prompted the pilot of the helicopter 
  to hover over the spot. Within minutes terrorists had jumped out of the vehicle 
  and allegedly opened fire at the helicopter.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;&nbsp; the helicopter too had retaliated 
  with machine gun fire. The Security Forces believe that at least a few terrorists 
  had been killed or injured in the `incident'. The Operational Headquarters of 
  the Defence Ministry was aware of the Kodikamam `incident' and the alleged use 
  of a vehicle with Red cross marking to transport terrorists. Army said yesterday.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Defence Ministry is expected to 
  raise the alleged use of a vehicle with the Red cross markings to carry terrorists 
  and ultimately fire at a Government helicopter with the ICRC.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the International Committee 
  for the Red Cross (ICRC) under Mr.Philip Comtesse moved to help the affected 
  people of the North-East war, some security forces officers have continuously 
  expressed the possibility of the ICRC assisting the LTTE terrorists.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;&nbsp; The ICRC upto now has failed to blame 
  the LTTE for any of the crimes committed in the past seven months, sources aid. 
  Since June last year nearly thousand Sinhalese and Muslims had been killed apart 
  from murdering hundreds of captured policemen.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;&nbsp; However despite the ICRCs willingness 
  to express continuous concern over security forces operations against the terrorists, 
  they had not blamed the terrorists for anything, security officers complained.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;The Island&quot; was unable 
  to reach any ICRC official by the time of going to press, yesterday afternoon.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>The Red Cross has long been a matter of controversy 
  in this dirty war. During the spring of 1987, a government helicopter bombed 
  an ambulance with red cross markings, taking injured persons from Pt.Pedro hospital 
  to Jaffna hospital, destroying the hospital ambulance, and killing the driver 
  and the patients. Later on, the IPKF accused the Sri Lanka Red Cross of transporting 
  arms for the LTTE. Whatever the truth of the incident reported, it is sheer 
  facetiousness to draw the ICRC into it, even a hint of malice.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The ICRC has been performing a yeoman task 
  under difficult conditions, coming under accusations from both sides. When the 
  LTTE and the Sri Lankan army were battling it out near the Fort in September, 
  shells fell on the Jaffna ICRC office, and not by accident. We know for certain 
  the ICRC's genuine concern for the welfare of civilians. There was very real 
  concern for prisoners, both in the South as well as for those held by the LTTE 
  in the North. There is no question of accusing the ICRC of dishonesty or hypocrisy.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The ICRC has operated according to rules 
  and has intervened in the press in accordance with these, during the war. The 
  first time in early September was to deny a government claim that the LTTE had 
  prevented it from transporting food for civilians in the North. The second time 
  was during the third week of October after the ICRC assumed control of Jaffna 
  hospital and an air force plane bombed within the area under ICRC control. The 
  Island should have known better how the ICRC operated, including its rules of 
  confidentiality.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>Criticism of the ICRC has to be made at a different 
  level, such as how relevant are its rules, how much it should bend them, and 
  whether it is realising its full potential or not. Such examination in a constructive 
  spirit would be useful and that is the prerogative of the press. When everything 
  looked absolutely dark in the South in 1989, the press too treated the coming 
  of the ICRC as a sign of hope. Why so much bile when the ICRC had also extended 
  its services to Tamils in distress?</span> <a href="#_Toc515969970">[Top]</a></p>
