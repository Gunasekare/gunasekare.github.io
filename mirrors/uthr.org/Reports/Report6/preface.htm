    <h2> <font color="#990000">PREFACE AND A GENERAL APPEAL</font></h2>
    <font color="#990000"><font size=+3>T</font>he crisis in Sri Lanka which 
    now faces the Tamils, and ultimately all the people of this country with an 
    uncertain future is one that appears to defy definition. The Tamils have largely 
    lost their spiritual and intellectual bearings and their physical existence 
    hangs in the balance. The manner in which the Muslims are being uprooted, 
    robbed and driven out en masse from the North, and the attitudes towards them 
    that are being promoted, puts the dominant Tamil ideology in very disreputable 
    company. In losing any sensitivity to what it means to be a minority, they 
    have forgotten their own history. The Muslims who were making steady gains 
    as a community have suffered setbacks as the result of the brutal intolerance 
    of the Tigers and the manoeuvrings of the government. They are now being inducted 
    into a culture of violence while sober and reflective Muslim voices are being 
    pushed aside. Apart from the Sinhalese peasants being killed in border areas, 
    the devastating potential for the Sinhalese contained in the general degeneration 
    of the political culture is seen in the continuing phenomenon of burning corpses 
    in the South.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">It is evident that those who wish for peace on this 
      island are at a loss to identify the problem, leave alone find a solution. 
      A recent press release by the Canadian Foreign Secretary Joe Clark illustrates 
      the point. In a `balanced' statement expressing concern over human rights 
      violations in this country, Mr.Clark called on both sides to go for negotiations 
      as the most appropriate means of resolving the dispute and ensuring the 
      safety of civilians in the North and East. Similar sentiments had been reflected 
      in a recent statement by the British Prime Minister and in a call made 
      by the Indian High Commissioner.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">On the other hand when speaking privately, there 
      is general agreement that everyone feels a sense of loss. Most people feel 
      instinctively that a negotiated settlement is a very remote prospect. Since 
      the outbreak of war, the natural, if unspoken, thrust of the government's 
      military and administrative machinery has been to speed up the obliteration 
      of historic Tamil associations and presence in the Eastern province. Its 
      callousness has brought death to over 6000 Tamil civilians - not in combat 
      but in massacres and bombings.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">The Tigers on the other hand, by their brutal massacres 
      of hundreds of policemen taken prisoner, and of 700 or so Muslim civilians 
      helped the process of dehumanisation by destroying the possibility of human 
      communication and understanding.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">Events over the last four months have left us with 
      two main obstacles to a negotiated settlement. One is the government's attempt 
      to deny Tamil claims in the East by bringing about a fait accompli through 
      decimation and displacement of the Tamil population. Although influential 
      sections of the government and the press have supported such moves, the 
      result will never be acceptable to Tamil opinion or help to build confidence 
      among them.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">The other is the character of the LTTE, the natural 
      articulation of which not just helped to precipitate the war, but calculatedly 
      left the Tamils at the mercy of enraged Sri Lankan forces whose nature was 
      well known, without the will or the capacity to protect them. More importantly 
      negotiations would mean talk of constitutional arrangements, elections, 
      settled conditions and some airing of dissenting opinion. Such would mean 
      questioning the legacy of the Tigers - a legacy marked by the tragic demise 
      of hundreds and thousands of young with a feeling and dedication towards 
      the well being of Tamils, TNA conscripts, ordinary civilians and intellectuals. 
      Any hint of openness would make the Tigers immediately nervous, and not 
      without reason. Between the months of January and June this year, there 
      was a precipitous decline in the purely emotional feeling that is called 
      support for the Tigers. Like in October 1987, this consideration must have 
      weighed heavily in the outbreak of hostilities. [See our<a href="/uthrj/Report/rReport4/Repor4.htm"> 
      </a><a href="../Report4/Report4.htm">reports 4</a><a href="/uthrj/Report/rReport4/Repor4.htm"> 
      </a>& <a href="/uthrj/Reports/rReport4/Repor5.htm">5 </a>and <a href="../../SpecialReports/spreport3.htm">special 
      report 3</a>].</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">We have to examine the peculiar phenomenon referred 

      to and how the government's attitudes have given it strength, durability 
      and according to LTTE sympathisers who leave the concerns of the people 
      out of their emotions, a necessity. It is important to understand this phenomenon 
      because in seeking a solution we have to go beyond feelings that seem very 
      reasonable at a subjective human level, beyond ethnic considerations and 
      see the process as a national malaise threatening all of us - not just in 
      this country, but the fall out from the success of this phenomenon will 
      influence movements in the Indian sub-continent as well.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">We spoke of feelings that appear reasonable at a 
      subjective human level, because in the present state of political culture, 
      many ordinary Sinhalese, soldiers and officers feel that the government 
      was very reasonable with the LTTE and that gestures of trust and restraint 
      were rudely and obscenely spurned. The government had provided the Tigers 
      during the 14 months of the LTTE-Premadasa honeymoon with military, material 
      and diplomatic help to replace the Indian army and its allies as the dominant 
      power in the North-East. The Sri Lankan army had also observed unaccustomed 
      restraint during several provocations by the Tigers in the months leading 
      up to June. The other side was not talked about. It is hard to maintain 
      that in helping the Tigers the government was helping the Tamils. During 
      the honeymoon the government had actually connived with the Tigers, directly 
      and indirectly, in the killing of hundreds of Tamils including TNA conscripts, 
      individuals and refugees with dissident associations. Further, the North-East 
      was brought under a regime with an apparatus of repression that was unprecedented. 
      Not knowing this side, but only the government's much publicised generosity 
      to the Tigers which it identified with the Tamils, anger against Tamils 
      came naturally with the massacre of policemen. To those who saw things this 
      way, the punishment of Tamils through bombing and atrocities seemed justified.</font> 
      <br>
      <font color="#990000"></font> <br>
      <font color="#990000"></font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">We spoke of this phenomenon as a common malaise 
      because of its self reinforcing character and its ability to look larger 

      than life in the general drift of subcontinental politics. Whether, it is 
      the grievances of the Tamils in Sri Lanka or of the Sikhs, Kahmiri's or 
      Assamese in India, governments have lacked the capacity to take a principled 
      and rational outlook, and instead tend to react with repression combined 
      with a lack of clarity. The ensuing process of alienation gives credibility 
      and strength to extremist violence and totalitarian forms of organisation.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">In Sri Lanka the results obtained by the LTTE and 
      JVP have convinced many people exasperated with the government, to believe 
      that only their methods work. Tamil leaders and parliamentarians had talked 
      about discrimination and federalism and had protested peacefully for decades 
      only to earn contempt, ridicule and organised violence. Peasant organisations 
      and trade unions in the South who protested against the impoverishment and 
      the decline in the quality of life resulting from economic policies of the 
      government, heavily linked to the dictates of Western capital and giving 
      multinationals direct control over large tracts of agricultural land, met 

      with the violence of goon squads and large scale dismissals. The government 
      appeared immovable. This was in 1980. Less than a decade later, the government 
      desperately invited the JVP for negotiations after it demonstrated its capacity 
      to kill, paralyse the nation and strike terror into the very corridors of 
      power. The LTTE after it responded to a similar invitation was feted in 
      the manner of visiting royalty, in sharp contrast to the abject fate meted 
      out by the government to its Sinhalese and Tamil detractors of a milder 
      sort. The government's capitulation to what it had earlier termed criminal 
      groups was even hailed as fine statesmanship by tired intellectuals, only 
      too ready to gloss over the lack of it in the past. The end result was to 
      pour scorn over the values of moderation, reason and decency, which were 
      now consigned to homilies over state television.</font> <br>
      <font color="#990000"></font><b><font color="#990000"></font></b> 
    <p><b><font color="#990000">The High Cost of Anarchy:</font></b><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">In habitually abandoning interests of the people 
      for transient tactical political advantage, a heavy price has been paid 
      in terms of the dignity of the nation and consequently of the people.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">The country is paying heavily for what lies behind 
      those sentiments coming with less subtlety from senior ministers and not 
      repudiated by the President or other cabinet colleagues. The Amnesty International 
      has been called a terrorist organisation and there is little sensitivity 
      to the process of the law which determines the character of the state.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">The Independent Surrender Commission was set up 
      by the President to facilitate the surrender of those having real or suspected 

      JVP links without the fear of meeting the scandalous fate of many other 
      youths. This worked well for a time and the commission's work was wound 
      up by the President in August. It has subsequently become well known that 
      a significant number of those who had surrendered had been killed after 
      they were released - something that may not have happened to them if the 
      commission had not existed at all. Answering questions in parliament, the 
      Minister of Defence has maintained that these persons were killed not by 
      the forces, but by villagers angry with the JVP.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">In early November `the Island' reported the appearance 
      of about 30 headless bodies in Thirukkovil and Akkaraipattu - a well known 
      fact in that locality. A Deefence Ministry statement published in the Sunday 
      Observer of 4th November described the claim as mischievous, following an 
      `inquiry'. Leading citizens of the area were quoted as having denied the 
      appearance of the bodies. The plight of these citizens who try to keep life 
      going in an isolated area full of refugees, in an atmosphere of terror, 
      is not hard to imagine.</font> <br>

    <p><font color="#990000">These are two among a host of instances showing 
      that the workings of civil society have ceased to exist in a large category 
      of instances. A generation is growing up without knowing that there used 
      to be such things such as post mortems, magistrate's inquiries and accountability 
      before the law.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">In this respect the government has utterly degraded 
      itself. As a liberation group the Tigers have not shown themselves in any 
      way superior to the government. The Tigers too have the last word by simply 
      denying everything. They deny the killings of Muslims and the regular disappearances 
      and ill-treatment of so called traitors that mark their rule. Humanity in 
      this country has been devalued and what increased the sense of loss is the 
      state's incapacity to assume a responsible role.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">But the state is itself a product as well as a promoter 
      of our value system, and all secular and religious institutions must share 
      the responsibility for this hopeless state of affairs. The parliamentary 
      opposition too shows no signs of trying to understand the seriousness of 
      the whole issue. The cause of human rights in this country has been made 
      weaker by the Opposition using it as a means to embarrass the government 
      rather than address the issue in depth. Even from some of the more intelligent 
      and articulate Opposition MP's, their contribution to the debate on the 
      Tamil crisis stops mainly at opposition the North-East merger. The main 
      issue of trying to restore a sense of confidence to the Tamil minority who 
      have suffered from years of state violence is hardly addressed. The government, 
      whatever its motives, can give legitimate reasons for seeking a solution 
      outside parliament, effectively devaluing the latter as the institution 
      presiding over the nation's destiny. It is high time that in the interests 
      of democracy the Opposition showed a greater sense of responsibility.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">The thinking of the Sinhalese intelligentsia as 
      reflected in the media has shown a general sense of complacency in the face 
      of a very dangerous situation facing the country. Many are advocating going 
      back to square one as if the Indian intervention did not happen. The growing 
      disenchantment in the South itself is lost sight of. Economic conditions 
      continue to worsen. It is a serious reflection on the state of the Sinhalese 
      people if thousands of youth join the army, not through patriotism but through 
      hopelessness and fatalism. What sort of a country is it where youth have 
      to think along the lines that it is better to join the army and be pensioned 
      off with loss of life or limb, than to be physically wholesome and unemployed?</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">What if after all this repression and frustration, 
      there is a mass swing of Tamil opinion towards a lobby calling for an annexation 
      of the North-East to the Indian federation? To be ignorant or complacent 
      of the many dangerous directions in which the situation could drift is a 
      mark of decadence.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">The destructive course of Tamil politics cannot 
      be defeated militarily. A change can come about only by creating space for 
      a new independent Tamil politics that has digested the lessons of the past, 
      to emerge. Though temporarily eclipsed in the North, pluralism in the South 
      is not entirely dead. The government may yet find it in its interests to 
      adopt tactically a radically new approach to the Tamil problem, because 
      of repeated tragedies as well as the sheer dictates of its survival, and 
      to sustain its present economic policies.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">This is best done not by discussing issues such 

      as Federalism and the North-East merger at the outset, but by taking responsibility 
      for restoring confidence amongst Tamils. This also means taking responsibility 
      for all the young Tamils, boys and girls, who are faced with a stark choice 
      between a well founded fear of the Sri Lankan army and the Tigers who will 
      use them as tools in their power game. An impartial inquiry into all civilian 
      deaths during this war, particularly into the role of the state forces, 

      is an absolutely necessary part of such confidence building. Without such, 
      accompanied by preventive measures, the dominant Tamil politics will reinforce 
      its claims, steadily destroying the community. The state will go on killing 
      with no tangible restraint, confused about its objectives and denying the 
      ugly things that everyone else knows about, until the nation itself drowns 
      in blood.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">Responsibility also means trying to understand why 
      the Tamils were alienated, why they were mortally afraid of state aided 
      Sinhalese colonisation and how the state machinery silently and decisively 
      worked to their detriment. It is no good dodging the issue by saying that 
      the law operates equally, when in fact the power to act and to deci</font></blockquote></blockquote><!-- #EndEditable --><!-- #EndTemplate -->
