<h3>&nbsp; </h3>
<p><br>
  <span style='font-size:24.0pt;color:#990000'>&nbsp;T</span><span
style='color:#990000'>he nature of the situation in the South flows from what 
  lies behind two contrasting sets of queues. One set, seen regularly in provincial 
  capitals, consists of long lines of young men applying to join the army. The 
  look on their faces has no hint of dare-devilry, patriotism or enthusiasm, but 
  is one of pure resignation. They are in their best dress, carrying files of 
  certificates and testimonials. Their bearing reflects too much awe and gravity 
  for a job that herds them together and drives them forward to kill and too often, 
  to have their limbs blown up.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The other set also consists mostly of young 
  men, not different in appearance from those in the first. But these are young 
  graduates in visa queues outside Western embassies. It is said that a very small 
  fraction of the 400 or so young graduates receiving highly prized engineering 
  degrees this year from our universities, can be absorbed into employment. But 
  emigration to Australia for instance, will follow almost for the asking.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;A research paper by public servants Kuhathasan 
  and Bedewela published in the Island (21st January) gives more frightening indications 
  of the plight of the youth. 36 percent of Sri Lankan women remain unmarried. 
  41% of the males and 35% of the females are unable to lead a family life due 
  to economic reasons. 22% of males and 14% of females do not have a house of 
  their own.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;It was against this backdrop that the government 
  was feeling nervous at the prospect of 200,000 Sri Lankans fleeing home from 
  Saudi Arabia once war in the Gulf appeared imminent. To appease relatives who 
  wanted them back even as paupers, a report in the Sunday Observer first gave 
  the impression that its embassy was contacting them and making arrangements 
  for their return. But advertisements for jobs in Saudi Arabia kept appearing, 
  apparently with government approval. It finally turned out (Daily News, 24th 
  January) that the government was doing little, if anything, to challenge the 
  Saudi position that in view of most services being declared essential, exit 
  visas are not being issued. At least in the case of those from the North-East, 
  the government could say that in consideration of their safety, they may be 
  better off in Saudi Arabia. Those in Jaffna are not protected by anti-missile 
  missiles.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;If Sri Lankans have become amongst the most 
  despised and devalued human beings, crises which have matured over decades cannot 
  be entirely blamed on the present government. But a government must be judged 
  by how much it cared for the people, how much it did to unite them and how creatively 
  it handled problems. It must be admitted that the current politics, both from 
  the government and the opposition, can only enhance cynicism and resignation.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>Human Rights: The government controlled `Daily 
  News' could often be clever and convincing in its editorials. Its issue of 18th 
  September 1990 addressed the question of burning bodies - an issue brought into 
  focus by the police confiscating from an MP at the airport, dossiers on missing 
  persons and photographs of burning bodies which were the property of the UN 
  Human Rights Commission.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;While being frank about the tragedy, it defended 
  the government, attacking `human rights do-gooders' and suggesting that the 
  subversive threat of the JVP, which did not play according to Queensberry rules, 
  could not have been handled by legal niceties. Its final paragraph said:</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;&quot;It is best that the unfortunate and 
  ugly chapter of this nation's recent past be closed. There is no need to stir 
  dustbins in an effort to gain political mileage. What is necessary today, is 
  to get rid of the causes that led to the subversive rebellion and ensure that 
  Sri Lanka will never again have to re-live the terror or resort to the counter 
  measures of those weeks and months now passed.&quot;</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;If that oft repeated sentiment is genuine, 
  there ought to have been an admission that a blunder was made and thousands 
  of innocents were killed because the JVP, and the LTTE subsequently, subjected 
  the forces to unaccustomed provocation. This should have been followed by some 
  concrete measures to restore human dignity and accountability before the law, 
  followed by steps at reconciliation. But what have we seen?</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Several persons in the South whose surrender 
  was overseen by the Independent Surrender Commission appointed by the president, 
  were killed following their release, after August. Replying to questions raised 

  in parliament, the defence minister suggested that these persons were criminals 
  killed by angry villagers.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;One political party, the NSSP, organised 
  the mothers of disappeared persons into `Mothers of the Disappeared'. A senior 
  government minister referred to this group as `mothers of criminals'!</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The same logic applies in dealing with the 
  Tamils. Despite repeated calls to forget the past and talk peace, there are 
  no steps being taken to give Tamils confidence or to check reprisals.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;In the meantime elite sections of society 
  go on as though the rest of the country did not exist. Roman Catholic bishops 
  and mahanayakes bless the president. The Minister for Defence will follow the 
  Anglican Bishop of Colombo as chief guest at the Thomian Fair `91 in February, 
  organised by his old school St.Thomas' College.&nbsp; He is sure to receive 
  a public commendation for the great job he is doing.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;In place of reconciliation, the country is 
  being alienated and subject to resentment at various levels. From which source 
  will spring the next bout of violence remains unpredictable. Something looking 
  harmless enough today may change its character in a crisis brought about by 
  politics of this kind. Many Kandyan Sinhalese for instance have observed that 
  hundreds of burning bodies appeared in the Central Province when a low-country 
  Sinhalese was DIG. It does not strike them so forcefully that the same thing 
  happened when this same officer was in the Southern Province. We do not have 
  a politics of reconciliation that would combat tribalism.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The government appears to be trapped into 
  a series of ill-fated decisions, without the character or the imagination to 
  end the cycle of brutality. Finally everything boils down to sensitivity regarding 
  human rights in its widest sense. We shall briefly examine how some key institutions 
  have responded to this politics in a manner that has made them part of the problem. 
  The role of the opposition has been examined elsewhere in this report.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>The Press: In a normally functioning civil society, 
  the press ought to play a creative role in checking degenerative tendencies, 
  presenting facts, clarifying issues and raising questions. The direction here 
  is determined by the fact that journalists who want more openness and fairness 
  find themselves constrained by terror. The mainline press, instead of giving 
  confidence to the oppressed and encouraging rationality, has only increased 
  alienation. Its pro-armed forces stance and selective reporting have further 
  alienated Tamils and large sections of the Sinhalese, and is by no means even 
  helpful to the armed forces. The Island on 1st November 1991, gave on its front 
  page a small report on 30 headless bodies in Thirukkovil, in the East. The reaction 
  from the Defence Ministry two days later was so harsh and intimidating that 
  this was never attempted again. What has been reported in the press is a series 
  of massacres of Sinhalese and Muslims by the LTTE. There was little hint of 
  the thousands of Tamils killed - including the recent killing of 54 Tamils by 
  the STF in the Amparai District in reprisal for 7 STF men killed. With reporting 
  of this kind, large numbers of Sinhalese who have experienced the forces at 
  first hand, remain skeptical of what they are told. For Tamils, such reporting 
  combined with the general chauvinistic undertone, reinforces the view - the 
  Sinhalese cannot be trusted.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;If the press was to be part of a rational 
  political process, it would, apart from trying to understand the ethnic problem 
  and checking unlawful behaviour by the state, have tried to probe the nature 
  of the LTTE, the internal drama within where human beings are moulded, the nature 
  of its international support and its arms procurements. This is how a democratic 
  society would handle the problem. The armed forces are then held in check while 
  being sensitive to the human reality.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;We have very little of that kind of press 
  . What appears about the LTTE is mostly unprofitable gossip taken out of context. 
  We read about Balasingam's missing dog four months late, jibes about Baby Brigades, 
  gold sovereigns and speculations about Prabakaran's health. Taken out of its 
  tragic human context, when Baby Brigades also deliver bloody noses, it becomes 
  all the more mystifying and demoralising. Indifference and lack of information, 
  and brutality coupled with mystification, are two sides of the same coin. Thus 
  to the defence ministry, the theft of 30 torch batteries became worthy of citation 
  as a ceasefire violation, while the army complains that during the LTTE-Premadasa 
  honeymoon, containers for the LTTE had slipped in through the port of Colombo.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Inspite of the army being lionised in the 
  press and the jingoistic coverage given to its activities, how really helpful 
  has the press been even to the army? The current Mossad Commission inquiry is 
  revealing.&nbsp; When so many things are wanting, it is probably not fair to 
  judge officers by whether they knew the difference between a circuit diagram 
  for a radar system and that of a vacuum cleaner allegedly displayed by Elta 
  Electoranics of Israel. But the officers who went there were no fools. They 
  discovered that Israel sold them three Dvora naval craft with defective generators, 
  and tried to sell others with engines tampered to run above design speed, to 
  meet tender specifications. It was plain that Israelis were hardly friends. 
  Almost certainly, who was making money would have been the subject of much talk 
  in officers' mess'. Why did the press hold up Israel as a friend? Was it in 
  the interests of the army to keep all this in the dark?</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;If the Israelis brought in by the Americans 
  were so deceitful and the LTTE's arms supplies such a well kept secret, it was 
  clear that the government's reputation was such that Sri Lanka had next to no 
  real friends. Why did the press not question this state of affairs?&nbsp; After 
  all, the people of this country, including the army, were paying the price! 
  The bogeyman picked by the press - the so called expatriate Tamil lobby - has 
  now been shown to be in reality a cardboard Tarzan.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Take the manner in which the IPKF was sent 
  out of this country. The army had grave reservations about it. But the press 
  joined in the euphoria over the IPKF's departure. Even recently, the Island 
  (2nd January) has, with qualifications, commended it as a positive achievement 
  of Premadasa. We do not question the desirability of the IPKF's going. But its 
  presence was precipitated by historical developments concerning the Tamils. 
  There was no surgical option. No questions were raised about what alternative 
  security was being given to the Tamils. The whole question was viewed chauvinistically. 
  The LTTE-Premadasa talks were mainly about subcontracting to an armed group, 
  the right to do as it pleased with the Tamils. As early as January 1988, a Tamil 
  editor had his press blown up for saying that, to ditch the Accord and talk 
  to the government was to ride a clay horse. To the forces, it meant stepping 
  into a quagmire.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;When the press publishes something strong, 
  it is seldom to do with healthy democratic reasons. It usually meant that there 
  was a powerful lobby that was unhappy. During September, the Sunday Island published 
  an article by a former diplomat, strongly protesting the moves to associate 
  the name and the cause of the Buddha with those responsible for murder and inhumanity.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;One columnist in the Island has obviously 
  been inspired by the army to give vent to their grievances and signal its unhappiness 
  with the recent cease-fire. It came out with many things either viewed with 
  approval at that time or passed over in silence. It recalled the government's 
  inaction over the killing by the LTTE of Tamil MP's and the help given to the 
  LTTE to decimate rival groups and capture arms.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;It recounted: &quot;Helicopters were given 
  to top terrorist leaders... sophisticated communication equipment and other 
  items including machine pistols were imported via an unsuspecting Sri Lankan 
  defence official. All packages to the Colombo based terrorists were sent through 
  this official, informed sources say.... Terrorists were allowed to import containers 
  full of supplies. All these containers were cleared with full speed.... Ruling 
  party leaders continuously backed this bunch of criminals and the opposition 
  failed to do much.... Hundreds of soldiers and well experienced officers had 
  been killed in action. All these were the result of the government allowing 
  Prabhakaran and..... to gain supremacy in the North East, concerned people say...&quot; 
  (Sunday Island 6th January 1991).</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;There is little doubt that information such 
  as what comes out during the Mossad Commission inquiry which commenced sittings 
  in Colombo during January, will only hurt once powerful persons who&nbsp; had 
  fallen from grace.&nbsp; The commission is inquiring into allegations made by 
  Ostrovsky in his `By way of deception', pertaining to Sri Lanka. It was also 
  reported that two stars of Jayewardene's cabinet were quizzed by the CID after 
  Premadasa became President. The press will not ask what Premadasa was doing 
  all those years as Jayewardene's second? There will hardly be commissions to 
  investigate the disenfranchisement of Mrs.Bandaranaike, the Welikade massacre, 
  and the banning of Left parties as the alleged organisers of the July 1983 violence.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;For a government that proliferates commissions 
  and task forces, there is remarkable resistance to appoint a commission to inquire 
  into the inquiry concerning the killing of journalist Richard de Zoysa. The 
  demand comes from the international community and the opposition. There is thus 
  a natural inhibition on the part of journalists about probing too far. Even 
  probing into the LTTE's current strength may not leave the government looking 
  too good.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The press could be entertaining. But it has 
  hardly been anyone's friend, or of much help to the nation.</span> </p>
<h4><a name="_Toc515970126"><span
style='color:#990000'>The Universities:</span></a></h4>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The University of Peradeniya, when it was 
  the University of Ceylon, was an outstanding university in Asia.&nbsp; For a 
  university where lively political debate continued into the 70's, now political 
  discussion is taboo. The events of the 80's, the racial violence, the civil 
  war and then the JVP's terror and the government's counter terror, have completely 
  changed the character of the universities. Students at Peradeniya have been 
  warned by the authorities not to come crying to them if they get into trouble 
  with the security forces. Most students who were forcibly kept away from their 
  studies by the JVP, do not mind this. Like their counter-parts in Jaffna, they 
  are totally disillusioned with the politics they have seen and share the same 
  aim - to quickly get their certificate and get out of this country. Their experience 
  which led to such cynicism, has also removed the need to think about the future 
  of this country and how they are going to live in it. They care as little for 
  their fellow students as they do for the armed forces. If a fellow student or 
  staff member disappears, a widespread comment would be that he asked for it.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;In an atmosphere where students are discouraged 
  from thinking about political issues connected with justice and their collective 
  well being, the students who come into prominence are those prone to hooliganism. 
  The ideal Vice Chancellor in such situations is not one inspired by great ideas, 
  but one who will play the Brigadier. The Faculty of Engineering which once produced 
  Vickramabahu Karunaratne, Lionel Bopage and Viswanandadevan is today a very 
  different place.</span> <br>
  <span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;</span> <br>
  <span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The staff too are painfully discovering that 
  political issues are things that they cannot isolate themselves from. For instance, 
  many of the staff in Engineering, Medicine and the Sciences are those who have 
  striven to maintain standards over years of contracting resources and staff, 
  resisting the temptation to emigrate. But the economic and political milieu 
  is one where students come out indifferent towards the country, its people, 
  and looking towards Australia and Canada. The staff in turn have to wonder what 
  they are about in terms of results achieved.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;One legacy of the 80's is that right wing 
  values - order, discipline toughness -are held in widespread admiration. When 
  it is said, `only this government can run this country', what they mean is that 
  this country has no future and only repression could keep discontent at bay, 
  until at least they are safely out of it.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The universities, which are integral to the 
  current politics, are thus of little use in terms of giving direction to the 
  nation. When it comes to solving the nations problems, the end result of state 
  repression is that rather than obtain help, the government has in the universities, 
  something nearing a white elephant.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;As is usual in cases of repression, people 
  feel powerless and their world is greatly narrowed down to their personal concerns. 
  They tend to jealously guard personal privileges, whether deserved or undeserved. 
  Take the performance of the universities during the current war. Only the Open 
  University Teachers' Association condemned the bombing of civilians in the North 
  in addition to the acts of LTTE, and called for the government to bring the 
  Tamils into a political process by clearly stating the terms of a solution. 
  Attempts by the OUTA to get the Federation of University Teachers Association 
  (FUTA) to move in the matter were of little avail.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;There was then the matter of hundreds of 
  students from the University of Jaffna wanting transfers to universities in 
  the South. Their reasons were varied. Some had faced intimidation and feared 
  returning to Jaffna. Some just could not operate as self respecting persons 
  under the LTTE regime. Some could not face the physical insecurity created by 
  the government's campaign. Others felt a mixture of these causes or felt that 
  the University of Jaffna was going to be in a state of crisis for a long time, 
  and that they would be better off with a degree from the South.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;There was firstly the question of space and 
  facilities. But it was a matter requiring a principled response from Students' 

  and Teachers' Associations in the South. Medical students from Jaffna who talked 
  to Southern colleagues and directly or indirectly with staff, found the response 
  almost wholly negative. These responses were largely based on gut personal feelings, 
  such as a desire to restrict competition or the possibility of losing British 
  Medical Council recognition, which Jaffna lacked. Comments were reportedly made 
  by staff such as, `We lost two years. Now it is their turn', or `Sinhalese students 
  cannot study in Jaffna and we cannot even tour Jaffna. Why should we have them 
  here'.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;While such feelings may be justified on a 
  personal level, how do they help the country and how politically prudent are 
  actions based on such feelings? It is a matter of regret to many in Jaffna that 
  the university's base has been narrowed down by the exclusion of Sinhalese and 
  more recently of Muslims. The tide cannot be turned overnight, but it is left 
  to those concerned persons to promote non-sectarian and universal values through 
  their actions. The southern universities lost an opportunity to lift the stigma 
  that descended on them in July 1983. Some of these students will return to Jaffna 
  with the feeling that one cannot blame the LTTE too much.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;By contrast, sensing an opportunity to score 
  a tactical victory to discredit the ideology of Eelam, even a UNP cabinet was 
  able to rise above gut communal feelings, and issue a directive to find places 
  in the South for students from the University of Jaffna wanting transfers. (Nevertheless 
  it was doing much else to give credence to that ideology). The universities 
  were largely insensitive, even to the point of being blind to national self 
  interest.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;While doing little that is laudable in the 
  current context, one can be sure that when everything is over, many dead and 

  governments changed, there will be from scholarly circles in the universities 
  and other well funded institutes, objective and very readable treatises on what 
  is past and buried.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>The Armed Forces:&nbsp; Over the last year, a number 
  of items have surfaced in the press to suggest strongly that there was much 
  discontent among the forces, particularly with the role into which the government 
  (and the opposition by default) was thrusting them. They have made their feelings 
  felt through the press and chiefly through Mrs.Bandaranaike, the leader of the 
  opposition.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;In January 1990, Mrs.Bandaranaike made a 
  statement on the floor of the House UTHR(J), <a href="\uthrj\Reports\Report4\Report4.htm">Report 
  No.4</a>], alleging that army officers were being ordered to get mixed up in 
  political killings, particularly by co-operating with vigilante units. She was 
  careful to add that only a small minority was associated in this and referred 
  to a particular officer in the Army HQ.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;There are strong indications that some officers 
  had approached foreign embassies for help in leaving the country, because they 
  disliked their orders. Following the Richard de Zoysa killing, the press reflected 
  puzzlement and dismay among certain quarters of the security establishment. 
  Some of them had even thought of de Zoysa as their man.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Going by traditions built up since the early 
  80's, it would appear that the average officer is not very sensitive about killing 
  civilians. But many are by indications sensitive about hit lists - particularly 
  when there is the class factor.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The political opportunism which pushed them 
  unprepared into the current war, made the forces both angry and irrational, 
  further strengthening and legitimising the LTTE. The president's boast about 
  doing to the LTTE what was done to the JVP, with its macabre connotations, and 
  the defence minister's rash promise to wrap things up in two weeks, both came 
  crashing down.&nbsp; The army found itself feeling weak and demoralised. From 
  the beginning of the war complaints have surfaced that the army suffered by 
  being deprived of air support because politicians were then using helicopters 
  for other purposes. One such complaint attributed to the former national security 
  minister in an interview, was later denied by him, and there was speculation 
  about his political future under this government. The latest was made in parliament 
  by Mrs.Bandaranaike, soon after the Mankulam debacle in late November 1990. 
  That was the time President Premadasa was visiting Jaffna. A complaint also 
  surfaced in the Sunday Times just after Mankulam that wounded army personnel 
  had suffered because of inadequate surgical facilities. Government doctors were 
  enjoined to volunteer.&nbsp; All these charges were strenuously denied. The 
  minister for defence angrily suggested in parliament that army personnel with 
  SLFP affiliations were circulating such falsehoods.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;It also surfaced in the press in early December 
  that a handful of senior army officers had revealed their intentions of leaving 
  the army, some at least to emigrate. These departing officers are often from 
  model UNP families. There is little doubt that the army senses that, obligatory 
  praise apart, hardly anyone loves them - in the South as much as in the North. 
  Even the government, it would appear, is not serious about them. They are not 
  sensitive about those whom they kill, but they keenly feel that they are being 
  made to carry the can for the failures of national politics.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;It is in the current context of political 
  ineptitude and demoralisation in battle, that plans have been announced to double 
  the size of the army to about 100,000. As we pointed out earlier, the army recruits 
  as much as the LTTE recruits are victims of the system who are moved mainly 
  by circumstances. For persons who have spent 20 years in the army to rise to 
  the rank of colonel, to resign,&nbsp; go abroad and live as nondescript persons 
  in the West, can come mainly from disillusionment. The country itself is largely 
  cynical. School leavers among the elite are hardly likely to look upon army 
  careers in the earlier manner.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Expanding the army under these conditions 
  would bring about serious problems of its own. A healthy non-elitist conception 
  of the army could be achieved under a different kind of politics. But here we 
  are trying to induct into the army disillusioned, deprived youth in an elite 
  dominated society with its value system in an acute state of crisis and confusion. 
  For young army officers who think of themselves as basically decent, it becomes 
  painful to face the fact that they are in an outfit where looting is virtually 
  regularised. Amidst political indecision, such an army is being pitched against 
  an enemy that is clear about its politics and plays its cards carefully. The 
  prospects for the army are not bright.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Expansion is also bound to heighten the tension 
  between&nbsp; professional and non-professional types - a distinction probably 
  blurred in practice. An extreme example of the latter is a police officer, who 
  in 1971 was reportedly deemed disturbed, and instructions were given to keep 
  him away from firearms. He showed his potential in a political service he rendered 
  in 1982 which found disfavour in a court of law. Thereafter his career zoomed, 
  reaching heights of notoriety during the anti-JVP campaign.&nbsp; The Richard 
  de Zoysa affair brought other names into public view. While such persons find 
  favour under the present political dispensation, many of their colleagues would 
  feel uncomfortable.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>General: What we have here is a dominant ideology 
  with its world view that has not been challenged. A politics based on it is 
  getting the country into deeper crises, with its misery, alienation and division. 
  Under this dispensation institutions including those of a liberal origin, function 
  in such a way as to reinforce the crisis. The hold of this ideology is seen 
  in that, with so much at stake (lives and the future of the nation), while hedging 
  for so long on putting forward the basis for a solution, the president has to 
  publicly seek the advice of the chief Buddhist clergy - the Mahanayakes. The 
  army which is a victim of the whole process is still groping. Even with increased 
  numbers it does not hope for victory. It only hopes to get the edge over the 
  Tigers in terms of brute force so as to pursue that old will-o-the wisp. That 
  is to negotiate from a position of strength with those with the guns, over the 
  dead bodies of thousands of ordinary people.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;All this is being done with no idea of the 
  consequences, as if India is far away, there are not 200,000 Tamil refugees 
  in India, that Tamil Nadu politics is not closely linked to Tamil politics here 
  and that the IPKF was only a bad dream. Suppose the LTTE is militarily smothered, 
  what if Tamil sentiment turns to India to intervene at any cost?</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Again the government though beleaguered from 
  so many quarters appears strong and stable, because the opposition has no cogent 
  ideas and the government is seen as the ablest practitioner to meet the demands 
  and contingencies of current politics. Only this government it appears can bridge 
  the gap between high sentiments and low deeds. Only it can hammer the Tamils 
  today and embrace the Tigers tomorrow. The tragedy is that these are seen as 
  necessities by influential sections.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Unless a new basis is found for Sri Lankan 
  politics and the opposition sees its way to articulating human rights with greater 
  consistency than for mere effect, we are in for greater tragedies. It is notable 
  that the opposition while campaigning over human rights violations in the South, 
  has come up with no ideas about the Tamil problem, except to continue the military 
  thrust. Too many opposition speeches suggest that care should be exercised in 
  the North, not because there are human beings there, but so as not to give India 
  an excuse to intervene. This gives substance to angry allegations by the government, 
  implying that when they feel threatened, the opposition would opt for repression, 
  however crude.</span><a href="#_Toc515970125"> [Top]</a></p>
