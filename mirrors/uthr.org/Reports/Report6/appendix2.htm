      <h2> <font color="#990000"><a name="a"></a>APPENDIX 2</font></h2>
    </center>
    <h2> <font color="#990000">The War in the North-East</font></h2>
    <p><br>
      <font color="#990000"><font size=+3>T</font>he war which is going on in 
      the North and the East has left a large number of people amid death and 
      destruction. People do not feel that the government is treating them as 
      their citizens. The bitterness against the Sri Lankan army and fear is still 
      lingering on. The happenings in the Eastern Province and other areas rightly 
      or wrongly reinforced their view that the Sinhala army and political establishment 
      is bent on destroying the Community. On the other hand they detest LTTE's 
      destructive politics and feel angry about everything happening around them. 
      If the government and the politicians in the South do not understand the 
      complexity of the problem and the trauma faced by the Tamil and the Muslim 
      people in the North and the East, then they will do more damage to national 
      unity of this Country than anybody else!</font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">The people are cynical about the guarantees on the 
      part of the government in solving the crisis in a proper and human way. 
      Instead of openly and clearly putting forward a concrete frame work in which 
      the government seeks to find a solution to the ethnic problem and to canvass 
      the opinion among the Sinhala masses and other political parties for consensus, 
      it is dragging on with vague promises. After all these tragedies have not 
      taken place for the very first time. These have happened in this country; 
      it was are not going to have a leadership which has the courage and the 
      wisdom to put forward an acceptable solution to the ethnic problem based 
      on regional autonomy or Federal set-up (which are the standard frameworks 
      in which the ethnic problems are being managed in most of the countries), 
      then the future of our country seems to be very bleak indeed. On the other 
      hand the way in which the government responds to the demands of every quarter 
      seems to imply that only the might of the gun is being respected by them!!</font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">The responses meted out to the democratic forces 
      led to despair and frustration of the Youth and lead to a form of destructive 
      politics which resulted in meaningless destruction in our land. Therefore 
      after seeing and meeting the people of Jaffna, I wish to put forward the 
      following requests to show sensitiveness to the people's need there and 
      to make them feel that they are a part of our Nation. The following measures 
      have to be taken immediately to save the situation from ruin and to avoid 
      large scale death and destruction at least, at this last moment.</font> 
    <p><font color="#990000"><b>(1)</b> It is fact that the people there do not 
      have confidence in the government; and they are also against the destructive 
      politics of the LTTE group. They feel that they are between the Devil and 
      the deep sea. Large number of youths are cynical about the whole thing but 
      they are powerless and fearful that if the army comes then their lives will 
      not be spared. At present people cannot move out of Jaffna that easily. 
      More than that, large scale effort is taken by the LTTE to force directly 
      or indirectly all the people mainly the youths to get involved in some activities 
      in the hope the army treat them as LTTE. Under these circumstances youths 
      do not have any option but to join them with the feeling that we fight and 
      die instead of drying in vain. Therefore unless the government and the armed 
      forces understand this and take measures to give confidence to those youths, 
      that there are alternatives for them, they will force a large number of 
      people into the destructive political path. For this, mere assurances are 
      not enough o convince the youths. We need concrete proposals to deal with 
      this situation. If the government announces that certain organisations such 
      as churches, temples, etc., as well as ICRC and some international Organisations 
      to oversee the process of arrest, it will give them some confidence. They 
      can be asked to gather in Refugee camps supervised by the ICRC (and other 
      NGO's help can also be obtained in this regard). And the army when they 
      want to arrest, they should be registered with the ICRC to make sure no 
      ill-treatment is meted out to them in army's custody. In this way the people 
      will have confidence that their lives will be saved. People are also sacred 
      to go to Refugee Camps as they also fear that the LTTE might provoke the 
      army. Therefore it is essential that these camps should have some international 
      representation. It is unreasonable and unworkable to transfer the whole 
      Jaffna population to Vavuniya. The destruction of properties seems to be 
      a pattern as far as the Sri Lankan army is concerned. Its going to alienate 
      the people more and more and the bitterness will last long.</font> 
    <p><font color="#990000"><b>(2) </b>The minors who are carrying arms are 
      also in fear of their life. It is necessary for a responsible government 
      to handle this situation with care. All of them should be given amnesty 
      and allowed to go back to schools.</font> 
    <p><font color="#990000"><b>(3) </b>There are incidents where the army have 
      killed those youths who are desperate and are trying to flee the country 
      with their families. Apart from few incidents the captured persons are being 
      badly treated. Those who are fleeing from Jaffna to India at this moment 
      are invariably cynical about LTTE politics. If the army would not understand 
      them and if they treat them like this, naturally they are bound to feel 
      sympathetic to Tigers' cause.</font> 
    <p><font color="#990000"><b>(4) </b>The State patronage given to the Sinhala 
      colonisation is well-known. The heavy destruction in villages around Trincomalee 
      has created fear amongst the Tamils that the earlier programme of colonisation 
      is going to continue. It is to be noted that it is a sad fact that certain 
      national papers argue this course of action to counter the LTTE's action 
      against Sinhala civilians : which shows how ignorant and irresponsible they 
      are. It is this approach that inherently breeds destructive politics. If 
      the State uses its power to demonstrate its ability to create insecurity 
      to the minority and by which they can subjugate them, then they are sowing 
      seeds for future destruction. Therefore its time for the government to assure 
      the Tamil people that they will not continue with this type of politics. 
      It is also morally wrong for the government to colonise a large number of 
      poor people in these area's for their short-sighted politics.</font> 
    <p><font color="#990000">Hope that the government will fulfil the above demands 
      to win the people's confidence and provide a concrete solution to this ethnic 
      issue. The two major communities are speaking two different languages and 
      majority in both communities also practices two different religions. This 
      shows the nature and the depth of the problem! Therefore it should be taken 
      very seriously and the solution be found to enhance national unity on the 
      basis of the multi-ethnic, multi-cultural, multi-religious nature of our 
      society for a lasting peace!! Hope we have learnt our lessons from our short-sighted 
      politics which ruined the whole nation!!! <b>(These are some reflections 
      made after I have seen, heard and touched Jaffna and its people. My visit 
      to Jaffna was from the 17th September, 1990).</b></font> <br>

    <p><b><font color="#990000">NOTE</font></b> 
    <p><font color="#990000">In this report we have brought out certain features 
      of the present political phenomenon in the North and East to raise awareness 
      of the situation. We cannot effectively tackle the human rights issues in 
      isolation unless we understand the political environment in which the violations 
      are taking place. How the media is being manipulated, emotions have been 
      raised, surveillance is being carried out, dissent has been suppressed are 
      matters of concern for anyone who cares about the fate of people. The reality 
      in which character degeneration is so widespread and terror has crept into 
      the minds of people make any semblance of normality very deceptive. The 
      legitimate fear and the insecure feelings of the Tamil community against 
      the Sri Lankan state is being harnessed to the full by the LTTE to legitimise 
      their hold on the people. In a sense the destructive politics is being institutionalised 
      to such an extent that no Tamil political groups are in a position to represent 
      the interests of the people. Unless this politics is replaced, talking about 
      human rights violations is a meaningless exercise. We hope that our reports 
      will play a role in that direction</font> <a href="#a">[Top]</a>
