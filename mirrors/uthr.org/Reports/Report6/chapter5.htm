<h4><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;<a
name="_Toc515970058">5.1 November 1989 - November 1990:</a></span></h4>
<p><span style='font-size:24.0pt;
color:#990000'>&nbsp;F</span><span style='color:#990000'>or the two years which 
  ended in November 1989, the university had attempted, and to a remarkable extent 
  succeeded, in confronting the activities of the IPKF and the LTTE which were 
  directed against the people - particularly their human rights violations. While 
  the IPKF regarded the university with a mixture of anger and respect, the LTTE 
  as an alleged liberation group, had little excuse to confront the university 
  openly. Nevertheless it watched the university closely, dropping hints of its 
  resentment. The university continued to stand up for the rights of the students, 
  even&nbsp; those with LTTE sympathies. Soon after the IPKF announced its cease-fire 
  in preparation for withdrawal on 20th September 1989, Dr.Rajani Thiranagama, 
  a prominent human rights activist in the university, was assassinated, signalling 
  by this act of terror, a new and menacing challenge to the university.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;It was partly with a view to meeting this 
  challenge that the university organised a peace march on 21st November 1989 
  focussing on the plight of the young who were being forced or cajoled into arms 
  by the two opposing sides. The LTTE which denied killing Dr.Thiranagama, sent 
  some armed men to the university who inspected the slogans to be carried on 
  the march and demanded that the march should call for a withdrawal of the IPKF. 
  This was rejected by the students as being against the spirit of the march as 
  well as a meaningless provocation. The pressure continued until the eve of the 
  march. Thanks in part to the presence of international delegates, the students 
  won the round and the march went ahead as planned. The student leaders had good 
  reason to fear the worst. In July, the previous year, Vimalaeswaran, a student 
  leader who had once challenged the LTTE over the disappearance of a student 
  in 1986, was murdered by the LTTE [<a
href="\uthrj\Reports\Report1\Report1.htm">UTHR (J) Report No.1]</a>.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;In December 1989, Anton Winsles, a provenly 
  conscientious student leader, was elected president of the university students' 
  union (USU). Winsles, as a one time LTTE helper, had close contacts in the LTTE, 
  but was uncompromisingly independent. The next crisis came as the IPKF withdrew 
  and the LTTE demanded that the student union vacate the room assigned to it, 
  which before October 1987 was used by the Maru Malarchikalagam (MMK) - a defunct 
  cultural organisation captured by the LTTE about 1986. When the students resisted, 
  the LTTE importuned a senior don, and even dropped hints that a death sentence 
  which was once passed on him had been held in abeyance.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The MMK became defunct following the IPKF 
  offensive of 1987. Finding LTTE literature in its room, the IPKF had proceeded 
  to ransack the university administration and the arts faculty offices, thinking 
  that the university was an LTTE complex. Instead of facing the question of whether 
  as a liberation group it had then used the university responsibly, the LTTE 
  accused the university of having destroyed the MMK. It is essential to note 
  that during the IPKF operation, the LTTE used university buildings to fire at 
  the IPKF and left&nbsp; before the IPKF reached the premises. The IPKF's retaliation 
  damaged the buildings, and roofs were virtually non existent in certain buildings. 
  It was the rainy season and almost all the university documents were wet and 
  they would have become unusable. But because of the staff's initiative, university 
  people were able to enter the university and safeguard the valuables including 
  the documents of the MMK! The university could have summoned a meeting of the 
  Co-ordinating Committee of Staff, Students and Employees (CC) to issue a statement 
  refuting this allegation. The CC was an institution formed in early 1989 along 

  with the mood of democratisation, and was very successful until the time of 
  the peace march. It had increasingly come under attack from senior persons who 
  felt that their power without accountability was being challenged. The Vice 
  Chancellor was under strong pressure to dissolve the CC. The LTTE's allegation, 
  made with an intimidatory thrust, went unchallenged. Once more, as during the 
  fast of 1986, the burden of carrying&nbsp; the autonomy of the university fell 
  on the student leadership.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Following the outbreak of war in June 1990, 
  the student leaders followed an old tradition in collecting materials for the 
  refugees pouring into Mullaitivu. The LTTE maintained that relief could be distributed 
  only in its name. Although the students had to consent to the LTTE, which now 
  monopolised fuel, transporting these materials, they annoyed the LTTE by distributing 
  them without naming any authority. About this time the LTTE issued a call for 
  the NGOs to support the struggle for Tamil self-determination led by the LTTE. 
  The USU issued a balanced statement in English critical of both sides and sent 
  it to the press. Following this, some persons from the LTTE's ROOTE, confronted 
  the students who had drafted the resolution. A doctored version of the resolution 
  was published in the press.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The ROOTE approached the USU and wanted it 
  to pass&nbsp; a resolution accusing the government of Sri Lanka of genocide, 
  calling upon the struggle led by the LTTE to be recognised internationally, 
  and for all people to unite behind the LTTE and join the struggle. A hint was 
  dropped that if the motion was not passed, the USU would be dissolved. By now 
  many members of the student executive had fled as refugees either to India or 
  to Colombo. It fell to Winsles to put this resolution to a general meeting. 
  At the vote, the motion was defeated 145 to 115. The LTTE wanted it put to the 
  vote a second time, and it was again defeated. Two days later Winsles was approached 
  by the LTTE and was forced to issue the statement required by the LTTE. Having 
  signed the statement, Winsles and his colleagues resigned from the USU.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;It may be wondered what inspired the student 
  body to defy the LTTE during these developments.&nbsp; One must&nbsp; keep in 
  mind the opposing aims of the two sides. The LTTE had for years displayed persistent 
  anger against the university, accusing it of not having helped them in any way. 
  It scorned the university, and a key leader of the LTTE, obsessed with the university, 
  is quoted as having said, &quot;If the Sri Lankan airforce bombs the university, 
  we would join them&quot;. The LTTE pursued a course of trying to forcibly identify 
  the university with it. Equally, the students in particular, feared that if 
  the army broke through into Jaffna, it would kill them. The LTTE on the other 
  hand would, by past performance, like to see some students and staff killed 
  for propaganda and mobilisation. In this acute dilemma, facing in particular 
  the students, the authorities remained silent.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The LTTE was very angry with the student 
  leaders and a high level of surveillance was kept up. In a meeting with the 
  authorities Winsles told a small audience why they could not function under 
  conditions created by the LTTE. This was repeated verbatim by a key LTTE leader. 
  Winsles and other student leaders were repeatedly asked to come for military 
  training. In having to flee Jaffna, Winsles and some of his colleagues joined 
  a long line of well-motivated predecessors, who saw the unmasked face of a tendency, 
  so appalling now as it was once attractive.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;There was a feeling in the university of 
  uncertainty and dissolution. The students received little guidance when the 
  LTTE launched its long matured propaganda campaign, suggesting that everyone 
  should join its fight, and that education beyond standard 8 was superfluous. 
  The students began drifting away to their homes, to Colombo and to search for 
  their families in the devastated East, after receiving strong hints, certainly 
  not contradicted by the authorities, that the university will not be allowed 
  to function for perhaps two years.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The staff and members of the administration 
  were strongly canvassed to make token gestures towards the war effort. Some 
  obliged for a variety of reasons, and were rewarded with favours, such as accessibility 
  and immunity for their sons from restrictions placed on others. With the USU 
  obliterated, the students came under the domination of the MMK which exerted 
  itself as a parallel or even superior administration. Most prominent in the 
  university was a student, who during the IPKF presence, had been charged with 
  an examination offence. The charges had been dropped without calling the invigiators 
  for an inquiry. Later he began appearing at the university in uniform in an 
  official vehicle, when all others were cycle-bound-from the Vice-Chancellor 
  downwards.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;In September, a human rights activist on 
  the staff had to go into hiding when LTTE squads went searching for him.</span> 
</p>
<h4><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;<a
name="_Toc515970059">5.2 November 1990 - An exercise in Autonomy:</a></span></h4>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The LTTE for a variety of reasons found itself 
  compelled to reverse its strictures on education. With the traditional obsession 
  with educational qualifications in Jaffna and with pressure on the young to 
  take to arms, the exodus from Jaffna reached serious levels. The pass system 
  brought in by the LTTE and the enforced rigours of travel, did little to stem 
  the exodus, though it made people delay plans, made them cough up gold sovereigns 
  and made them more anxious. Further, all this combined to give expatriate Tamil 
  opinion a jolt.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Suddenly the silent educational authorities 
  went into action as though it had become everyone's patriotic duty to restart 
  educational institutions. Staff and students who had gone out of Jaffna because 
  of the war situation were summoned back to Jaffna.</span> </p>

<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;If the LTTE was going to allow the university 
  to function, there was, as just after the IPKF operation, a strong case to reopen 
  the university if it could function as a self respecting institution, safeguarding 
  the interests of the students and the community. The students resident in Jaffna 
  were largely for reopening for three reasons. Being occupied would make it easier 
  for them to resist being importuned for military service. There was an instinctive 
  feeling that they would be safer if the university was functioning, whenever 
  the Sri Lankan army came in. Thirdly, they were so disillusioned that they wanted 
  to quickly finish their studies and go abroad.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Before reopening, the authorities had to 
  face some important questions. They had to face the fact that Muslim staff and 
  students were physically prevented from being in Jaffna. A number of staff and 
  students had left Jaffna because they could not function democratically or because 
  they felt physically threatened by the LTTE. There were many who felt that the 
  security situation was inimical to their presence. There was no let up in the 
  bombing and shelling. A Sri Lankan military thrust appeared more imminent now 
  than it had been earlier, when the university was closed all but in name. In 
  reopening the university a clear statement of objectives and principles was 
  needed. Students were being recalled from far away places in the East, where 
  they had gone to join their traumatised families. No protest came from any quarters 
  of the university against the treatment meted out to the Muslims and their fellow 
  Muslims students. When few students from the Eastern province who were in Jaffna 
  requested the university authorities to consider the plight of the other students 
  from the Eastern province, senior officials and students from Jaffna had paid 
  no attention to such pleas. The university had an obligation to give confidence 
  to both these students and their families that it was taking steps concerning 
  the students' security. It could have demanded from the LTTE that it should 
  not do harm to students or staff. That the university being essential to the 
  future of the Tamils, it should refrain from maintaining an armed presence in 
  a given neighbourhood of the institution. Parallel to this it could have demanded 
  from the government that no military operations should be conducted in this 
  area. Such steps would have created a sense of solidarity and would have upheld 
  the dignity and autonomy of the institution. These ideas too were not new, in 
  view of previous dealings with the IPKF.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Again responsibility demanded that there 
  being no normal situation,&nbsp; normal rules should not be applied. There was 
  no question of forcing staff and students to report. A clear statement of objectives 
  would have served as grounds for appeal, for everyone to co-operate in keeping 
  the University open. This was what was done in the climate that prevailed in 
  November 1987.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Nothing of this kind is known to have been 
  done in the current situation. There was a deafening silence on the obligations 
  of the institution towards its members. Instead the carrot and stick was used 
  in a humiliating manner. A letter was reportedly handed over to the University 
  Grants Commission asking for the staff not to be paid in Colombo. Pressure was 
  also applied on the UGC not to entertain students requesting transfers to other 
  universities.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The UGC was left with the thorny problem 
  which an autonomous institution should have handled. What was to be done with 
  the staff and students who had legitimate reasons not to go to Jaffna? There 
  was also genuine concern in the UGC for the safety of the officials of the University 
  of Jaffna. If they were acting under duress, a wrong move on the part of the 
  UGC, it was felt, would place them in jeopardy. There was also a reluctance 
  to interfere in the normal prerogatives of the university and be accused of 
  conspiring to run down an institution of the Tamils. The UGC, long regarded 
  as the interfering arm of the Sri Lankan state, appeared more concerned for 
  the autonomy of the University of Jaffna than the university itself.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Once the university reopened there were few 
  illusions about who was in charge. Staff members going to their designated lecture 
  room sometimes found that the room had been commandeered. There were regular 
  meetings with compulsory attendance where those like Yogi poured out their muddles. 
  Communalists in the South would have drawn comfort from Yogi's reasons for acting 
  against Muslims.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The climax of November was the observance 
  of National Heroes Week in the university. Senior university persons spoke to 
  the effect that not only should they commemorate the martyrs, but that one day 
  they should all become martyrs. In the minds of the speakers it may have been 
  a harmless piece of gimmickry dictated by fear -just as they knew that arming 
  children was totally wrong, but pretended that in view of the exigencies of 
  the `last battle', the issue did not exist. The impact of such rhetoric on students 
  and their parents need not be elaborated on. Having come to the university expecting 
  protection, they were being called to be martyrs to a cause they generally dreaded. 
  The LTTE itself uses such speakers for propaganda value, but would never take 
  them seriously. One speaker who said that they must all work 48 hours a day 
  for the cause had already&nbsp;&nbsp; sent his son to Colombo. Another had already 
  sent his wife and children to Britain and hoped to follow them, when the army 
  moved in. One don even suggested to the students to remove Sri Lanka in the 
  address they put in their dissertations and asked them to put just University 
  of Jaffna, Jaffna. On the other hand, he confided to one of his colleagues, 
  &quot;If the army moves in, we will all become born again Sri Lankans.&quot; 
  For the intellectuals it is a clever somersault. But for the young boys and 
  girls who are giving their lives for a cause legitimised by this intellectual 
  set, it is a tragedy.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Another university official speaking to students 
  seeking transfers in Colombo, assured them that there was no problem and that 
  everything was normal in Jaffna - something the Sri Lanka government would have 
  been happy to have him tell foreign journalists, who have been maligning the 
  government over its military policy.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;One senior academic and administrator who 
  had kept an independent mind, found himself occasionally provoked into subtle 
  dissent. The LTTE wanted a high powered group of intellectuals to advise them 
  on how to revive the economy. This academic told them, &quot;There are a very 
  large number of people and farmers thrown out of work between Jaffna and Palaly. 
  They are the persons you must ask. We are hardly qualified to advise you&quot;.</span>
