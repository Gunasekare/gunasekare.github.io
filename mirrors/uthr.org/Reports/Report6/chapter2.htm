<h3>&nbsp; </h3>
<h4><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;<a
name="_Toc515969803">2.1 Liberation or Degradation? - The People's Experience:</a></span></h4>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Immediately prior to the June war, the Liberation 
  Tigers massacred hundreds of surrendered Muslim and Sinhalese policemen in the 
  Eastern Province and called upon people to join hands with them in the final 
  battle. In Kalmunai on 11th June, they killed 10 Sri Lankan soldiers who had 
  come to buy provisions and desecrated their bodies. Following this display of 
  manly courage, after about 4 days, the Tigers made a precipitate withdrawal. 
  Often, the Tigers in their motorised transport hooked it ahead of frightened 
  people they had pledged to protect, who had to follow on foot.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Then came the &quot;brave&quot; soldiers 

  of Sri Lanka, sending thousands of unarmed Tamils to an involuntary nirvana, 
  displaying an astounding inventiveness when it came to inflicting pain. The 
  anger of the Muslims, following the murder of over a hundred Muslim policemen 
  from the East, was directed into the orgy of barbarity. The Tigers in turn resorted 
  to collective reprisals against Muslims to shore up their credibility amongst 
  &quot;Tamils&quot;, which was now close to non-existent. It was collective reprisals 
  by the Sri Lankan state against Tamils in 1983, that had given the Tamil militant 
  struggle its initial legitimacy.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;About 12th July, a convoy of Muslims travelling 
  in vehicles between Kalmunai and Kattankudy was stopped by the Tigers. According 
  to Muslim and Tamil sources, several of the Muslims went on their knees and 
  pleaded. Over a hundred were taken prisoner and a few bodies were dumped at 
  Kurukkalmadam - a village reportedly not supportive of the Tigers. This was 
  followed by the massacres of Muslims at Kattnakudy and Eravur on 3rd and 12th 
  August respectively.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Between the government and the Tigers, the 
  destructive anti-people politics of the East was brought to new tragic heights. 
  The people, the Muslims and Tamils, had nothing to thank either side for. Being 
  burdened with so much sorrow and being unable to plan for and contemplate those 
  things that are a source of ordinary human happiness, the people were now being 
  driven to take vicarious satisfaction in the infliction of pain on brother and 
  neighbour, now artificially classified as an enemy. Not having anything to show 
  for their politics except shattered lives and destruction, crusading against 
  Muslims became the mainstay of the Tigers. In early October, a leading Tiger 
  personality&nbsp; visited Vakarai to sound out local feelings. Many took fright 
  thinking that there were going to be renewed attacks against Muslims in the 
  East - although the capacity of the Tigers in that area had been weakened. What 
  eventually did happen by the end of October was the expropriation and expulsion 
  of Muslims from the North. While many Tamils were puzzled and often angry, the 
  shameful act received a measure of approval in the East. Many were also disturbed 
  by parallels in Tamil history - such as the government taking it out on Tamils 
  in Colombo and elsewhere for the killing of 13 soldiers in Jaffna. The treatment 
  of Muslims in the North was strangely reminiscent of the anti-Jewish pogroms 
  of the Tsars and other bankrupt European rulers down to Hitler.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;On the morning of 16th June, Justice Minister 
  A.C.S.Hameed was flying into Jaffna, for what he yet faintly hoped would be 
  the placing of the formal seal on a cease-fire agreed during the previous day's 
  talks. At 6.30 a.m. the Tigers for some unspecified reason had fired at the 
  Jaffna Fort. The Jaffna hospital which had gone through several bad experiences 
  because of firing from the Fort since 1986 was left in a state of uncertainty. 
  On 19th June the Tigers removed all their cadre from the hospital saying that 
  another lot of injured was being brought in. At 12.30 a.m. on the 20th, there 
  was another round of firing at the Fort. The patients and the hospital staff 
  fled without further prompting. Later in the morning the hospital authorities 
  decided to close the hospital. On the 21st, the LTTE's propaganda chief Yogi, 
  pulled up the puzzled doctors for closing the hospital.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Then commenced the aerial bombing by the 
  Sri Lankan forces, much of which had no military purpose. Officially the bombing 
  was described as a precise operation directed at identified and verified targets. 
  A general described it as something undertaken at great risk in populated areas. 
  In practice any small arms fire from below, any gathering of youth or movement 
  of vehicles of the type used by the LTTE, became legitimate provocations for 
  bombing. What was near these targets, hospitals, dwellings of civilians, or 
  refugee camps did not matter. Privately, several officials held that as long 
  as civilians harboured the LTTE, they ought to take the punishment. The manner 
  in which the game developed, both sides wanted civilians killed. One because 
  of callous anger and the other found use for civilians mainly as propaganda 
  material in the form of corpses. (See our earlier reports).</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;As the liberators shifted camps by taking 
  over civilian houses, one area after the other became a target. They fired at 
  passing aircraft from the ground, from vehicles, from near refugee camps and 
  once from the proximity of the ICRC building in Temple Road, Jaffna.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;With having to fight a war on the cheap with 
  budgetary restrictions, the precision achieved in certain kinds of bombing was 
  of the order of that obtaining with huge catapults throwing molten metal onto 
  the enemy, in use during the epic battle between Dutugemunu and Elara of the 
  2nd century B.C. Indeed there was much improvisation from the tactics of that 
  period. Barrels of human excreta were air-dropped on Jaffna. The required precision 
  was amply served by Chinese built Y12 transporters. The old petrol filled barrel 
  bombs with rubber casing were replaced by new varieties. When the military called 
  for a ban on urea based fertiliser being sent to the North-East alleging that 
  the LTTE was using it to manufacture explosives, there was an element of set 
  a thief to catch a thief. Some varieties of barrel bomb dropped from Y12's were 
  using urea and salt. Jaffna farmers and housewives are now in search of unexploded 
  barrel bombs.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Civilians from smashed houses sometimes spoke 
  admiringly of Y12 bomber pilots. After a good deal of trial and error, they 
  even managed some bulls eyes. In conformity with IMF restrictions more Y12's 
  are reportedly in the pipeline.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Both sides had long ceased to battle for 
  the hearts and minds of the people. It was rather over their lives. During the 
  battle for the islands in late August, the government announced (an aerially 
  imposed) curfew, and helicopters hovered menacingly to shoot at anything that 
  moved. On the same morning the LTTE announced over the loudspeaker at Muthiraisanthi 
  that travel passes would be issued on that day. Passes to get away from the 
  two forces became such&nbsp; coveted possessions, that hundreds were bound to 
  queue up, parting with two sovereigns and ignoring the risks.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;There was seldom any seriousness about defending 
  the people. The object seemed rather to endanger them. After the army had landed 
  in Kayts, the LTTE either denied that the army had landed or assured the people 
  that the army would be resisted and&nbsp; prevented from moving in. Many who 
  tried to get away to the safety of the mainland were stopped from going. Some 
  of these persons were later killed by the army. One of them was shot at a church 
  in front of his young child. The scenario was consistent with what had happened 
  in the East. The pass system together with extortionate transport charges to 
  leave Jaffna fitted into the same pattern.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;It was a strange sort of struggle in many 
  ways. The liberators started the war, but the onus for the welfare of the people 
  was being placed on the government. When the liberators could not provide food, 
  electricity and medicine, the government was accused of depriving the people. 
  People sought safety in the enemy territory of Colombo, at least as much because 
  of needless suffering imposed on them by the local regime as by the aerial bombing. 
  Having destroyed all independent organisations, the LTTE showed few signs of 
  taking responsibility for the welfare of the people. Staving refugees were pouring 
  into Jaffna. Many of them readily parted with their remaining capital in the 
  form of jewellery, literally for a meal. A lady was offered a pair of gold bangles 
  for Rs.150/-. She declined because she thought it robbery to accept. Then came 
  the offer, &quot;If the price is high, take them for Rs.50/-!&quot; Some student 
  leaders who tried to work independently with the refugees left Jaffna in frustration 
  and fear after being sternly told that they could only work through big brother. 
  What was being encouraged in the name of liberation was individual greed, selfishness, 
  lying and opportunism. The unwritten philosophy that had grown with this politics 
  was that maximum social frustration brought maximum recruitment motivated by 
  a suicidal will to destroy. A liberation which gives meaning to their life in 
  death only!</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The army withdrew after briefly occupying 
  Paranthan in July, during which they had levelled the shops surrounding the 
  market square for their protection. Then the LTTE came and destroyed government 
  buildings including the bank, new post office, MPCS and the water tank, burning 
  valuable files and documents belonging to the people. The apparent excuse was 
  that the army should not be left with buildings to occupy. Equipment at the 
  Paranthan Chemical Corporation providing employment to large numbers was also 
  destroyed. In the meantime Jaffna papers reported that many houses in villages 
  neighbouring Paranthan had been looted by the army. But according to local people, 
  the army had hardly been to those villages and that the looting had been done 
  by someone else while the people had been away during the operation. In one 
  village, Kumarpuram, all houses had been broken into, except that of a leading 
  LTTE supporter. The villagers asked him, &quot;It was the army who did it, didn't 
  they?&quot;. After the initial shock, the supporter asked threateningly, &quot;Are 
  you serious or are you being sarcastic?&quot;.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Sometimes there appeared to be a measure 
  of co-ordination. In Mannar during late October, the LTTE looted the Muslims 
  and expelled them. Immediately afterwards, the army moved in and looted the 
  Tamils. It was all done peacefully with no fighting. So proverbial had become 
  the army's reputation, that some LTTE persons on gold collection campaigns have 
  asked, &quot;Why do you want to keep your gold? If you don't give it to us, 
  the Sri Lankan soldiers will take it from you when they come!&quot;</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Looking at the whole struggle, one does not 
  see any aim or strategy except destruction. People in different localities are 
  handled tactically by appealing to dormant rivalries and animosities. Now in 
  mid-November, the LTTE is moving in high profile in Jaffna as though it is in 
  full control, calling upon people to join in patriotic acts of flag flying and 
  making provocative preparations to celebrate National Heroes week at the Jaffna 
  Fort which was vacated by the army. This is being done not in the wake of victory 
  but when the enemy is literally at the gates following a recent advance in Valikamam 
  from the base at Palaly.&nbsp; Many observers know that for some time defences 
  had been prepared along the approaches to Thenmaratchi, in preparation for a 
  withdrawal from Valikamam. People in Thenmaratchi have heard it from local LTTE 
  leaders that the people of Jaffna are to be taught a deserved lesson.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;If the government had mature statesmanship, 
  its aim should have been to clearly demonstrate to the Tamil people that it 
  cared for them. But it has instead competed with the LTTE to demonstrate contempt 
  and callousness. Food for starving civilians has been withheld causing tremendous 
  suffering to the sick and those injured by the government's bombs. The LTTE 
  has understandably not faced any deprivation. It has only put the civilian population 
  at the mercy of racketeers and certainly more dependent elsewhere. The government 
  did not stop its harassment here. When people sent food packages to relatives 
  in Jaffna through a church organisation, these were subject to systematic pilfering, 
  including the removal of anything&nbsp; of speculative military value, such 
  as candles and matches. All essential medicines carried for the sick and the 
  ailing were robbed by troops at Vavuniya. Even bottles of Sanatogen were robbed 
  as if the government had intelligence of tottering Tigers past their three score 
  years and ten. By this policy the government lost an important political battle.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Thus were both sides locked in a war against 
  unarmed people, using young men and women forced by one or more of fear, hatred, 
  penury and hopelessness to become `heroes'. It is evident that hatred and contempt 
  for the people was shared by both sides. On the part of the Tamil militants, 
  whose unspecified cause is still being associated with liberation, how does 
  one explain these feelings of animosity towards their own flesh and blood?</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;One aspect of the matter which was brought 
  to the surface during the LTTE-Premadasa honeymoon still remains valid. When 
  the leaders are pushed by considerations of survival, they are quite capable 
  of becoming natural allies. It is yet possible that both sides will come to 
  a tactical agreement. The leaders of the state will have panegyrics written 
  to their unequalled statesmanship. The Tigers will as before show two faces. 
  One in Colombo and another in Jaffna. One set of interviews for the English 
  press and one for the Tamil. Liberal sentiments in English and threats against 
  traitors in Tamil. Having called upon hundreds of young men to commit suicide 
  for Eelam, they may once more argue that a transitional tactical understanding 
  is necessary. All this is again possible given the nature of the forces and 
  their intrinsic weakness. It will once more be argued that the Tamils got something 
  because the Tigers fought.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;There is surely one thing that both sides 
  would want to forget and even suppress - the sacred memory of the dead. Both 
  would want to avoid accountability on this matter. This would be a matter of 
  common concern pushing them to embrace each other. Both sides have behaved as 
  though individual lives can be snuffed out at any gunman's whim. The causes 
  and callousness are too ugly to be disinterred. Until we are accountable to 
  the dead any attempt at peace will be tenuous.</span> <br>

<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp; &quot;That which hath been is now; and that 
  which is to be hath already been&quot;.&nbsp; - Ecclesiastes.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The Leader gave a series of press interviews 
  about the beginning of the second quarter of this year, largely, though not 
  completely, putting an end to speculation about his continued existence. Answering 
  a question on how the consequences weighed in his declaration of war against 
  India in October 1987, he replied that he was not thinking about the consequences. 
  But, he said, he was thinking about whether to fight a war against India or 
  not. This reply was applauded by many members of the Jaffna intelligentsia as 
  one that was both clever and fitting. One detractor observed: &quot;You go to 
  the Jaffna bazaar on any day, and you will see riff raff elements transporting 
  heavy sacks on their backs between lorries and shops. At the close of the day, 
  they go with their earnings to a tavern, get drunk and often get into violent 
  quarrels. Before a fight, they do not think of the consequences, how it will 
  affect their families, whether they will starve or whether they will be thrown 
  onto the streets. No, they only ask whether to fight or not to fight. In a healthy 
  society, we will call such lumpen conduct irresponsible and will look for means 
  of providing these persons with a more edifying vision about their life. When 
  we have a leader who acts and talks in this vein, and is applauded by those 
  who ought to know better, we are left with something frightening that is within 
  us&quot;.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;How did an &quot;educated&quot; society come 
  to acquiesce in a leadership that left the people so degraded before the eyes 
  of the world? A part of the answer lies in the acceptance by a large section 
  of the middle class of the utopian ideals of Tamil chauvinism that over-rode 
  basic human considerations. Any objective evaluation of what the LTTE had been 
  doing over the past decade and more, should have left no illusion about what 
  to expect. This is particularly evident in the field of individual killings. 
  These went on despite the fact that there was no organised opposition to the 
  LTTE after 1987. The fact that the LTTE could find no other ways to deal with 
  dissent, symbolises its intrinsic weakness and paranoia.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The manner in which targets were chosen is 
  significant. Sunderam (killed 1982) and Mano Master (killed 1984) were persons 
  who had matured through the militant struggle, and had they lived there would 
  have been a qualitatively different kind of leadership, less authoritarian and 
  more accountable to the people. Sunderam was a member of the PLOTE. Mano Master 
  at the time of his murder had returned to his native place of Pt.Pedro after 
  differences with the leadership of the TELO, to which he had belonged. Though 
  the other groups were strong then, the LTTE timed its killing when an opportunity 
  presented itself, where Mano Master was a lone individual without institutional 
  backing. The LTTE systematically, with patience, looked for opportunities and 
  killed persons who were strong and able enough to give the Tamil struggle a 
  new and healthy direction.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Its fear of ideas combined with individual 
  ability remained strong even after it brutally asserted itself as the leading 
  group in 1986. It killed members of the old Left such as Vijayanathan and Annamalai. 
  It waited two years to kill the student leader Vimalaswaran after terror had 
  largely reduced the students to apathy. Former dissidents and ex-militants were 
  hounded out, detained and tortured, when all they wanted was to be left alone 
  to live quiet lives. hundreds of those taken in are not accounted for. What 
  the LTTE actually achieved was to kill courage, character, ideas and originality&nbsp; 
  among Tamils. The community was forced into a milieu bereft of any fresh air 
  and cut off from any invigorating contact with the outside world.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;This is reflected in the drastic change that 
  has taken place in the world of art and literature. 1985, though a period of 
  anarchy in comparison with the past, was a time of intense intellectual activity. 
  Many militant groups were around and many issues were being raised and discussed 
  by young people. There was a variety of literary output. Translations of articles 
  in English were cyclostyled and sold for small sums of money. Leaflets and booklets 
  of poems were in abundance. There were also drama groups providing a variety. 
  All this ceased following the LTTE's decimation of the TELO in mid-1986.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;By contrast, in present day Jaffna there 
  is nothing. Whether intellectuals, dramatists or religious dignitaries, the 
  only ones allowed to operate are those who will deliver to order. At all levels 
  of civil life, the soul is fled. The final assault on the university is described 
  in a separate chapter. If one compares the situation in the South, where things 
  are as it is pretty bad, the seriousness of the self inflicted blow that the 
  Tamils have received becomes evident. In the South there is still a variety 
  in journals and of literary output. There are a number of political groups taking 
  a critical line against Sinhalese chauvinism and are raising human rights issues 
  in the North as well as the South. Plays are being produced, occasionally banned,&nbsp; 
  then to reappear. There are drama groups from rural areas producing anti-war 
  dramas, questioning the class based exploitation inherent in sending young men 
  into the battle field. Education in the South is in a far better state than 
  that in the North-East. Much of the disadvantages resulting to the Tamils in 
  education are self-inflicted. Our management of this resource has not been of 
  a quality such as to clearly expose how it has suffered from discriminatory 
  and military actions of the government.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;While there was and always is discrimination, 
  the curtailment and destruction in recent times of the existing infrastructure 
  that makes for civilised life - such as in education, transport, health and 
  communications - has a good measure of what was part of the politics. Again 
  the politics of the LTTE, whenever there was the prospect of something that 
  would challenge its solitary claim for power, irrespective of the promise it 
  held out for the Tamils as a whole, was to precipitate a crisis. This happened 
  during the killings of dissidents and Sinhalese civilians in September/October 
  1987 and in the killings that led to the current war. It then relied on terror 
  against Tamils and the oppressiveness of the enemy to offer itself as the only 
  medicine. The direction has been to frustrate ordinary human aspirations of 
  the Tamils, deprive them of any alternative, pushing many to opt for the destructive. 
  Sinhalese culture, which many Tamils fervently believed to be a barbaric one 
  is today in a much more promising position than Tamil culture. An Indian journalist 
  G.Ramesh (Lanka Guardian 15th November) has pointed out that Tamils in general 
  have not posed the shocking question - whether the Tamil language will be alive 
  in 100 years time! That would be an ironical postscript in view of the original 
  aims of the struggle.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;It is against this backdrop that the LTTE 
  leadership fears individuals raising questions and has an abnormal fear of those 
  who have belonged to political groups. In this whole context many dissenters 
  have claimed that the LTTE&nbsp; has right along paid far greater attention 
  and has shown a qualitatively superior ability in stamping out Tamil dissent 
  than in combating the enemy against which they are claiming to fight. Whether 
  liberation can come as a byproduct is not a subtle question.</span> <br>
  &nbsp; </p>
<h4><a name="_Toc515969805"><span
style='color:#990000'>2.3 In Defence of What?</span></a></h4>
<p><br>
  <span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The LTTE was an organisation which, particularly 
  in the early 80's, had recruited many persons of ability, humanity and intelligence, 
  like the other groups. Such persons started having doubts, particularly after 
  the crackdown on the TELO, and quietly started leaving the organisation. This 
  phenomenon reached crisis proportions particularly in the months following the 
  IPKF offensive. So desperate had become the situation that according to dissident 
  sources, an order went out to area leaders to shoot civilians arguing against 
  or resisting the laying of landmines in their neighbourhood. It is said that 
  only two leaders, Lollo and Mathi, both now dead, could command the callousness 
  to carry it out.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;At this point, a conscious decision was taken 
  to expedite and encourage the mass recruitment of the very young, down to about 
  the age of ten. Instead of exposing this tragic bankruptcy with greater statesmanship 
  and concern, the IPKF actually legitimised and encouraged this process by sponsoring 
  its own conscript army - the TNA. the misbehaviour of other groups also played 
  into the hands of the LTTE. The LTTE had discovered in children its ideal recruits 
  - very brainwashable, totally irresponsible where the public is concerned, and 
  given the lack of an alternative once inside, very loyal if their creature comforts 
  are catered for. This shift was reflected in propaganda against education by 
  LTTE spokesmen. Changes in the pattern of warfare have also paralleled this 
  history. During the IPKF presence following the October 1987 offensive, the 
  main thrust of the LTTE was to frustrate the IPKF&nbsp; as well as to frustrate 
  the emergence of any civilian effort independent of the LTTE. Except&nbsp; in 
  Mannar, there was hardly a successful LTTE attack even against an IPKF sentry 
  point. The success in Mannar was achieved by actually firing at sleeping soldiers 
  from inside the hospital building, calculatedly putting the lives of 89 patients 
  at risk. The LTTE proved that the easiest way to fight an army which was callous 
  about civilian lives, and itself look powerful in the process, was to fight 
  them with total disregard for&nbsp; civilians. The massacre by the IPKF of 53 
  civilians in Valvettithurai on 2nd August 1989, which cost the IPKF dearly in 
  political terms, followed the LTTE breaking a truce and killing about six soldiers 
  on patrol. During this period, the number of Indian soldiers killed by the LTTE 
  is comparable with the number of unarmed civilians it assassinated. The latter 
  were often done by young boys wielding pistols.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;But the myth concerning the superior fighting 
  qualities of the LTTE was decisively broken. With the help of the Sri Lankan 
  army, the LTTE's first attempt to dislodge the PLOTE&nbsp; from the Wanni during 
  mid-1989 was a costly failure. The second attempt in January 1990, as costly 
  as it was, succeeded only because the LTTE was able to launch repeated attacks 
  with fresh supplies of manpower flown in by the Sri Lankan Air Force.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The developing trend became clear with the 
  outbreak of the June war with the Sri Lankan forces. The experienced hard-core 
  who were in short supply would be used mainly to defend places of high military 
  or prestige value. The rest, including children, would be used mainly to harass, 
  frustrate and to go to the frontline. Civilians were to be endangered for propaganda 

  value rather than protected. This is clear from the sketch in 2.1. The young 
  and inexperienced were also frequently used as expendable military material. 
  The copious use of suicide squads, being so unique in the modern world, was 
  often publicised as a mark of high dedication and courage rather than as a tragic 
  misuse of the brainwashed young. There was also a general poverty of military 
  imagination in terms of defining objectives and using manpower and lives effectively. 
  Lives were often expended in purely romantic ventures which were&nbsp; then 
  given a religious significance.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;During the first attack on the Fort in June, 
  young boys who were sent to scale the walls of the Fort died attempting the 
  ridiculous. During the second attempt in August, the scheme of action where 
  a crane was to lift the attackers into the Fort was so clumsy, that the crane 
  tilted on uneven ground and 40 of the attackers were mown down in the open. 
  During the army action in Kayts and Mandaitivu in August, the army was hardly 
  resisted, though the people were prevented from fleeing to the mainland for 
  safety. Left in total confusion, over 100 civilians were killed by the army 
  which suffered no loss. 49 Eastern province LTTE cadre sent there with no knowledge 
  of the terrain, committed suicide without seeing action.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;While the Tigers were trying to explain away 
  these drawbacks which had become part of a pattern, a parallel drama was being 
  enacted with unerring efficiency by the special surveillance unit of the Tigers, 
  answerable directly to the leader. Mails were tapped, people and their contacts 
  were watched. Ex members of a defunct militant group in Karaveddy, who had even 
  contemplated working with the Tigers after the Indian offensive, were picked 
  up in early September and were tortured. Imagined signs of dissident activity, 
  even Bible studies, were looked into. Considerable talent and resources in the 
  form of mature cadre were channelled into this activity - so much so that persons 
  who had narrow escapes discovered that they had been trailed by parallel units 
  which failed to exchange information. Even when the enemy was at the gates, 
  they were taking no chances with their own people. It is clear that defending 
  the people was not among the priorities of the group. Nor was fighting the enemy 
  among them. They knew they could get power by frustrating any thing by anyone 
  else.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;In eliminating other movements, the Tigers 
  also did away with the obligation to defend civilians. Every forum in which 
  civilian concerns could be raised was also suppressed. When several groups operated 
  before mid-1986, competition between them ensured that all tried to show a concern 
  for civilians. The concept of bunkers and air-raid shelters was introduced and 
  popularised by the PLOTE. It built one in front of Jaffna hospital with an alarm 
  system to warn civilians to take cover when the Sri Lankan army started shelling 
  from the Fort. This was widely admired.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Apart from other regular instances of deliberately 
  endangering civilians, we take current patterns of deliberate institutionalised 
  harassment of civilians. Following the July 1983 violence, many people flocked 
  to Jaffna determined to make it a permanent home. But today people want to flee 
  Jaffna on an unprecedented scale, signifying the alienation they feel towards 
  the struggle.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The LTTE has responded by instituting a pass 
  system with draconian conditions. In 1985 people gave gold voluntarily towards 
  the militant cause. Why does gold have to be forced out of people through terror 
  now? A family wanting to go to Colombo has to hand in the house keys. A family 
  leaving for India has to hand over the title deeds as well as belongings such 
  as bicycles. Extortionate transport charges were levied and safety and comfort 
  in travel were deliberately jeopardised. The army was prepared to allow the 
  use of the main road between Vavuniya and Elephant Pass. This was stopped by 
  firing at the first few lorries to take the main road.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;There was a massive exodus from Jaffna when 
  the pass system was lifted for two days on 6th and 7th October. Those fleeing 
  were abused through a loudspeaker at Mirusuvil, as cowards and traitors. It 
  is ironical that those going from Jaffna to Colombo are called traitors, while 
  they lucky ones able to make it from Colombo to Geneva, London or Toronto became 
  patriots. They are actively canvassed to make life miserable for their fellows 
  at home. If the same logic applied to those leaving Jaffna&nbsp; is strictly 
  applied to the expatriates supporting the LTTE, the results would be far from 
  flattering. In so many ways enormous pressure is being applied on people not 
  to leave Jaffna - to what purpose? The whole concept of National Heroes week 
  observed from 21st - 28th November is an instance of the indignity with which 
  those in Jaffna&nbsp; are rewarded. The whole notion was ironical.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;In the middle of a war of liberation, it 
  is natural for liberation fighters to appeal to the people not to forget the 
  sacrifice of the dead through leaflets and such like. Any elaborate commemoration 
  is put off until victory. But here enormous resources have been spent at a time 
  of hardship, and people have been forced to decorate and put up shrines while 
  in a state of vulnerability and the enemy virtually at the gates. As predicted, 
  the government which had learnt nothing over the years, fired from the air wherever 
  signs of enforced festivity were visible.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;On the final day, the LTTE ordered that all 
  teachers and students, with women in red and yellow and men in white, should 
  present themselves at school at mid-day. Students were asked to monitor the 
  teachers presence during the Heroe's Week&nbsp; celebrations. This piece of 

  harassment&nbsp; had no value whatsoever, not even in terms of publicity. It 
  was meant simply to give the population the message, &quot;We order as we please, 
  and you obey.&quot; A similar event took place during the first quarter of 1990. 
  People were forced to decorate and observe for a month, the second death anniversary 
  of Annai Poopathy of the Batticaloa mothers' front, who fasted to death. The 
  order went out that coconut shoots in the pandals should be replaced with fresh 
  ones every 3 days. At Tharmapuram, near Kilinochchi, the people failed to do 
  this when their coconut trees failed to yield fresh shoots. A punishment was 
  enforced in the form of a hartal.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Such deliberate callousness is motivated 
  by the aim of rendering the people docile, by removing any sense of self respect 
  and frustrating every normal human longing. By thus debasing humanity, a small 
  community can pack enormous destructive energy that can frustrate powerful armies. 
  But this society cannot do anything edifying for its own self. In the process 
  of multiplying misery for itself as well as for others, it will commit suicide. 
  It is like nuclear fission. In the process of releasing enormous destructive 
  energy, the mass - the people - is destroyed!</span> </p>

name="_Toc515969806">2.4 The Fate of Truth in an Orwellian World:</a></span></h4>
<p><br>
  <span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp; One redeeming feature of the Sinhalese South 
  is that despite the barbarity of burning bodies, the truth is hard to suppress. 
  Still there is a variety of reading matter in circulation. Some diversity of 
  opinion reaches the printed word. Questions are being raised and there is a 
  healthy scepticism about the political leadership. Attempts to strengthen state&nbsp; 
  patronage over religion and use it to cloak infamy can still elicit sharp rejoinders 
  (Sunday Island, September) Pluralism still shows a capacity survive, although 
  authoritarianism and terror bring about from the people the responses of cynicism 
  and indifference, weakening the society and state as a whole.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Between the North and the South truth becomes 
  a casualty in two different ways. In the South the credibility of the state 
  is so low that people have a tendency to disbelieve what the government says. 
  Among ordinary people in the South, there is still confusion about who massacred 
  the Muslims in the East and who drove the Muslims out of Mannar. In this situation 
  the plight&nbsp; of civilians in Jaffna is not difficult to imagine. On the 
  one hand there are the broadcasts by the state which simply turn them off. There 
  is no printed material coming from outside and no foreign news. There are only 
  three Tamil newspapers printed locally, all directly or indirectly controlled 
  by the Tigers. One of them, the Eelanathan, is the Tigers' official journal. 
  Such is the high point of the struggle for freedom.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Yet a discerning reader could learn the truth 
  from these more eloquently from these than from anywhere else. The massacre 
  of Muslims by the Tigers was being denied angrily and strenuously by Tamil orgnisations&nbsp; 
  abroad. According to Tamil ideology the Muslims were part of the Tamil nation 
  and hence any killing of Muslims must be a serious affair. The killing of Tamil 
  civilians by aerial bombing in Jaffna and the massacres of Tamils in the East 
  were events that were regularly receiving front headline coverage. It was only 
  natural that `Uthayan' should have given the massacre of over 100 Muslims in 
  the East on 3rd August, front headline coverage. The other two journals which 
  are closer to the Tigers presented this incident as a small item. It was later 
  learnt that the Uthayan was pulled up for his concern for the Tamil nation.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;While the massacre of Muslims by the Tigers 
  was being denied, the Eelanathan was publishing articles of such kind as would 
  incite a reader to feel that physical harm done to Muslims could not be very 
  wrong. In a closed intellectual world where people were forced to breathe the 
  same poison they excreted, there was for the first time,&nbsp; growing talk 
  that the Muslims were separate from the Tamils - something that Muslims had 
  being saying all this time and people would not listen to. The path was being 
  paved for the draconian expulsion of Muslims.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;During the battle when Sri Lankan troops 
  crossed from Mandaitivu (Leyden Island) and entered Jaffna Fort, a fighter plane 
  flew seawards over the Fort and disappeared from sight. The Tigers did not know 
  that it had plunged into the lagoon. The news was first given out over the Sri 
  Lankan radio. the local Tiger news bulletins promptly claimed that they had 

  shot down a fighter. The Tiger office in London then made a claim that they 
  had shot down a fighter with a SAM 7 missile. The official version in Jaffna 
  was changed accordingly.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>The `Eelanatham' gave Jaffna readers translations 
  of excerpts from Ostrovsky's book on the Mossad, `By Way of Deception'. It gave 
  the portion where a Mossad agent speaking in front of Sri Lankan military officials 
  in Hebrew referred to them as monkeys hardly off the trees, who needed to be 
  given a banana and sent off. He had then shown them slides of the inside of 
  a vacuum cleaner, saying that it represented an up to date sophisticated radar 
  system. The paper failed to mention references to Mossad training given to the 
  Tigers, and that as far as the Mossad was concerned, Tamils too were included 
  in the monkeys just off the trees, all deserving of as much attention as their 
  money warranted.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;This silence is also revealing. For many 
  years the Tigers have tried to present themselves as a liberation movement seeking 
  contacts with such, the world over. Their propaganda has been laced with references 
  to the Sandanistas, the Palestinian struggle, the ANC and so on. Moreover, their 
  enemies and victims have been accused of being agents of the CIA and&nbsp; Mossad. 
  This is the level at which the public is being informed.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Thus Tamils are forced to live in an atmosphere 
  where there is no variety of opinion. No self examination. And crucial questions 
  about their future are not raised. The atmosphere is demeaning of humanity and 
  destructive of intelligence. Instead, people live on gossip and pointless speculation 
  that substitute for factual reporting. Lawyers' courtroom tricks are used to 
  disown Tamil responsibility by leading persons. Ingenious rationalisations are 
  found for incidents such as the Kattankudy massacre - &quot;Those who went to 
  the Mosque as late as 8.30 p.m. could not have gone there to pray. They must 
  have been plotting something.&quot; Or that &quot;Muslims are leaving Jaffna 
  because the government is paying them to do so&quot;. These are elements of 
  a Tamil disease that has reached new proportions. This is the kind of atmosphere 
  in which the Tigers' politics of collective suicide can thrive.</span> <br>
  &nbsp; </p>
<h4><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;<a
name="_Toc515969807">2.5 Role of the Tamil Intelligentsia:</a></span></h4>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;During the abortive peace earlier this year, 
  many members of the Tamil intelligentsia living in the West and in Colombo flocked 
  to conferences organised by the ROOTE (Research Organisation of Tamil Eelam) 
  in London and Jaffna. ROOTE is an LTTE organisation which sought to co-opt this 
  intelligentsia in its attempts at development. The meeting in London was opened 
  by Kittu lighting the traditional lamp - a man who claimed to have killed dozens 
  of civilians during his stint as Jaffna leader, and whose gruesome massacre 
  of TELO members remains a public scandal. These meetings came at a time of euphoria 
  when it appeared on the surface that the Tigers would deliver the goods. Several 
  of those attending these seminars were leading authorities in their scientific 
  fields.&nbsp; They were also products of Jaffna's liberal English public school 
  educational system, which reached its peak of success in the 50's and 60's.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Those who commented on attending&nbsp; these 
  said basically the same thing in a self-righteous dismissive manner: &quot;We 
  are not interested in politics. we only want to contribute our share towards 
  the development of our land.&quot; Strictly speaking this is not true. Quite 
  often when military successes by the Tigers or the killing of a large number 
  of sri Lankan soldiers or Sinhalese appealed to their chauvinistic vanity or 
  played to their hatreds, they readily applauded it. They had routinely made 
  political judgements and had emotionally identified themselves with the Tigers.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;But even through their hardened hearts they 
  were dimly aware that things were not altogether right. They were uncomfortable 
  with the Tigers having killed several members of the educated elite. A large 
  number of able young men dedicated to Tamil freedom had met cruel fates at the 
  hands of the Tigers. Over a thousand at that time were languishing&nbsp; in 
  the Tigers' draconian prison system. Then there was the fate of very young children 
  of the largely poorer classes being militarily mobilised - to which a blind 
  eye was being turned. When members of the intelligentsia say that they are not 
  interested in politics and want to join the festive euphoria occasionally spread 
  out by the Tigers, it only means that they wish to indulge their vanity without 
  taking their share of responsibility for this immense injustice and tragedy. 
  The Tigers well understood this. Thus did the `cream' of Tamil society become 
  shameless camp followers to a cause that one day, when sanity is restored, Tamils 
  will be manifestly ashamed of.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;This phenomenon also underlines the emptiness 
  of a society where the drive for education in the sense of social and material 
  success was so great that any perspective of the totality of life was lost sight 
  of. So much prestige was attached to routine research into minutiae, where the 
  authors and their publications would be forgotten in 20 years, that there was 
  an arrogant disdain of the common issues of ordinary life -like justice - that 
  make up politics. Opinions are routinely given with such pompous arrogance on 
  political issues, as if social prestige was a substitute for hard time consuming 
  analytical thinking.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Once again the conduct of the intelligentsia 
  in Jaffna was characterised by cowardice and opportunism, safeguarding themselves 
  while endangering others. Some of them would go as volunteers to dig bunkers 
  for the Tigers, an event to which much attention would be drawn. They would 
  then spend a short time in a safe place and get back home. This would then serve 
  as publicity to pull in others to work in really dangerous places. The members 
  of the intelligentsia performing this service would receive privileges - such 
  as immunity for their children from military tasks. Many of them had escorted 
  their sons to Colombo while defending the use by the Tigers of less privileged 
  children. While admitting that use of children is wrong in principle, they would 
  add, &quot;But this is the final battle!&quot; While on the verge of completing 
  immigration formalities to take themselves and their children away to Australia 
  and Canada, they still continue to feed others with irresponsible lies about 
  Muslims, dissidents and about the prospects awaiting those left behind.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Members of the intelligentsia at home could 
  adduce reasons of survival, however selfish, to explain their behaviour. But 
  for a sizeable section of those abroad, it is a matter of fighting from a distance 
  a bizarre battle, according to the dictates of their warped souls. They do not 
  even want to know the consequences of what they are advocating. When it comes 
  to home, leading Tamil expatriates in Western capitals practice rules of censorship 
  which would have been an embarrassment even in Jaffna . When it came to their 
  acts, the militant groups generally preferred silence to offending the intelligence 
  of the local man. Among the worst offenders are some of the expatriate publications 
  in English. They have obfuscated the stories behind several well known killings 
  about which no one would attempt to fool the Jaffna man. They would have it 
  that civilian refugees fleeing to India upon the Tigers assuming control early 
  in 1990, were killed not by the Tigers or the Sri Lankan forces, but that they 
  were victims of factional fighting in the TNA. The Muslims were not massacred 
  by the Tigers, but by paramilitary units within the Sri Lankan forces. There 
  is even an impressive network to co-ordinate the spread of lies. An allegation 
  against the Tigers would bring&nbsp; the typical response, &quot;Tell us the 
  source, so that we can deny it.&quot; An editorial in the Tamil Times mildly 
  suggesting that the June war was least wanted by the people and was imposed 
  upon them, brought about an outraged response from some leading expatriate quarters.</span> 
  <br>
  &nbsp; </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;While the propaganda machinery at home is 
  managed unconvincingly, that abroad has several highly educated and able persons 
  in it, who know how to succeed in the West and would spare no effort or expense 
  to get their sons into the most prestigious Western universities. But what do 
  they do to the sons of the soil&nbsp; at home? Some of them have doubts, but 
  they want the recognition of being office bearers in the local Tamil Sangam.&nbsp; 
  So they allow themselves to be used by a minority of active individuals. Some 
  have changed political colours so many times that they are just cynical. A senior 
  and articulate academic in North America would make inspiring speeches about 
  the Tigers being our legitimate representatives. He would then confide privately 
  that he spoke rubbish. A senior Tiger leader told a private audience that he 
  knew that the expatriates were not serious, but that they would use them for 
  propaganda purposes. A study of the expatriate intelligentsia, how they are 
  manipulated by a mixture of fear and appeals to personal vanity, their insensitivity, 
  would all reveal the workings of Jaffna society in the extreme without the benign, 
  mitigating cultural influences at home, which still struggle to survive.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;In contrast to the intelligentsia there are 
  many Tamil refugees in the West, socially insignificant as they are, who have 
  been through the struggle and make a genuine effort to understand what is happening. 
  Unlike English journals, there are a number of Tamil journals published by these 
  groups which raise questions and issues from the heart.</span> <br>
  &nbsp; </p>
<h4><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;<a
name="_Toc515969808">2.6 Dissent in Jaffna:</a></span></h4>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The process of closing all formal fora for 
  alternative opinion is now virtually complete, and there are few places where 
  any intelligent discussion takes place. The lack of any desire to think seriously 
  about the future and demand that there should be an alternative course to collective 
  suicide, coincides with a very widespread practice by the literate (meaning 
  a large section of Jaffna) to find alternatives to living in their homeland. 
  Wherever one comes across groups in conversation, there is a dominant trend 
  towards exchanging information on `travel agents', how to get visas, the point 
  system for Australian immigration and such like. Colombo is awash with Tamils 
  going to travel agencies, embassies and communication centres. Overseas telephone 
  calls have become a way of life in sharp contrast to a decade ago. It is between 
  these preoccupations that people make casual political judgements. Though individuals 
  still take considerable risks to dissent, most observers are agreed that even 
  in the jaws of disaster, there is little chance of any mass protest. The Tigers 
  too recognise that while terror has its effect, the most potent mechanism for 
  dampening dissent has been the ease with which the Jaffna man can go abroad. 
  A significant number of the economic institutions left among Tamils concern 
  this activity. The politics of the Tigers has meshed with this trend. This is 
  why a person who goes to Colombo as a traitor becomes a patriot once abroad. 
  Then the same shallow interest in the well being of their people and the habit 
  of not analysing, would well suit the needs of the Tigers.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Under such conditions it is to be expected 
  that much of the dissent is bound to be private, largely passive and confined&nbsp; 
  to limited long term objectives. The bulk of these dissenters have one thing 
  in common. They are conscientious persons with enormous courage, with a strong 
  commitment to the people and the land. We take three broad categories.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;One group consists of Hindus with a deep 
  sense of their cultural roots, with a grounding in the ethical teachings of 
  Indian sages, particularly Thiruvalluvar, and in the laws of nature based on 
  karma. They would have a commitment and a sense of purpose in their work, but 
  would not voice public dissent, though their feelings about the politics of 
  the Tigers could be surprisingly strong and uncompromising. One example is a 
  lady doing a very responsible job. Her outlook was moulded partly by observing 
  her nephew, disillusioned but trapped in the organisation, who in his last days 
  experienced the agonies of a wounded soul. She was once walking to work when 
  she was told of the murder of a prominent person. Upon inquiry she was told 
  that the killers were unknown. In keeping with the training of women of her 
  generation, who would use Tamil to convey affection and intimacy, and English 
  to sound authoritative, she responded sharply: &quot;What do you mean you don't 
  know? IT IS THE TIGERS!&quot; She said nothing more and walked on looking grave. 
  While responsibility for the killing was being obfuscated in expatriate circles, 
  there was no fooling those with a strong instinctive feeling about Jaffna society. 

  They were convinced that the choice was between this politics and the survival 
  of the Tamil community.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Another in this category is a leading citizen 
  faced with considerable risk as well as responsibility through all the recent 
  military operations. He has stuck to his work in Jaffna with his family, rejecting 
  all temptations to emigrate. His identification with the people is so close 
  that he would freely and patiently attend to people who come to him for help 
  at odd hours. For a number of years he did not express his personal opinions, 
  but would answer&nbsp; questions about facts surrounding his experiences with 
  clinical precision. He confided recently: &quot;I have no illusions about what 
  the Sri Lankan army would do if it came in to Jaffna. I may get killed. But 
  that is a small thing. Unless this politics is destroyed, there is no hope.&quot; 
  Unlike expatriate sentiments, such come from persons with a sacrificial commitment 
  to the land and its common people!</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The second group we consider is a sub category 
  of Christians often at odds with the established church for trying to live and 
  teach the Gospel. The established church in Jaffna is by some tests more compromised 
  than the church in the South. Though the church in the South has been cowardly, 
  it still provides some fora for open discussion. The Church in the North has 
  not voiced itself on issues of traditional Christian concern, such as the militarisation 
  of children. By leaving such matters to the ICRC and voicing itself only on 
  Tamil grievances against the government, the established church may do more 
  harm to the people than good. One or more leading functionaries of one denomination 
  have been saying things like, &quot;95%of the people support the Tigers. The 
  rest are Sinhalese!&quot;</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Against this background conscientious Christians 
  have had a difficult time - particularly those who believe that the Gospel demands 
  the practice of non-violence. A young Roman Catholic clergyman in his parish 
  ministry kept raising questions about what is going on and about his non-violent 
  convictions. A tense situation developed when a section of the parish murmured,&nbsp; 
  &quot;The Bishops in the South are giving money to the president's National 
  Defence Fund. Only our clergy want to talk non-violence.&quot; That is a pointer 
  to the failure of the Church as a whole by actually endangering&nbsp; those 
  who are conscientious about the teachings of Christ.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;A senior colleague of this young clergyman 
  recently addressed a mass rally as the guest of another parish. Calling for 
  a self examination, he laid down five necessities. One called for a change of 
  heart from the militants. The priest of the host parish became worried upon 
  seeing some militant cadre in front of the church premises. In summarising the 
  sermon, he gave a slight twist to the necessity mentioned - &quot;May God bless 
  the cause of the youth&quot;.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Addressing a group of students on social 
  responsibility, a theologian raised the matter of killing Muslim civilians in 
  the East. Talking to him later, a worried official of the institution let it 
  slip that what mattered to them were not his ideas on social responsibility, 
  but his academic credentials.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;These person are a handful of individuals 
  in the established church. Others of increasing significance are represented 
  by the growing non-conformist and house churches. Though lacking material resources 
  many of them have laboured with commitment and have advocated non-violence. 
  Though not to the liking of the LTTE any more than of the established churches, 
  open confrontation has so far been avoided. This is largely because they regard 
  their primary task as preaching the Gospel. Though their activities may hamper 
  support, they do not pose a direct threat to political power.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;A very significant sector from which passive 
  opposition springs is the hard working peasantry spread across many rural areas 
  of the North and those in allied services. The heyday of their prosperity was 
  during the government of Mrs.Bandaranaike. Since then their economy has been 
  on a precarious footing, at the mercy of market forces, import policies and 
  the security situation, all more unpredictable than the weather. For their survival 
  they have a keen awareness of what is going on around them, decisions in Colombo, 

  oil crises, all of which determine their decisions from month to month. A sudden 
  influx of imported onions into Colombo would mean they have to decide whether 
  to store or to sell at a loss. They also have a tradition of hard work. Such 
  people question everything and are difficult to fool. If transportation that 
  is crucial to their survival is blocked, they would know the politics behind 
  it.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;It is such persons who sheltered student 
  leader Vimalswaran for a year in the heartland of Jaffna when the LTTE's writ 
  was unchallenged. Without a political commitment from this class, dissidents 
  on the run would not have stood chance. Not surprisingly some of the populist 
  measures contemplated by the LTTE leadership during the interlude of peace were 
  aimed at this class. These people know that as individuals they do not count. 
  For tactical reasons they would bow to the LTTE and for their survival they 
  would run errands for the LTTE at great risk. But in their minds they are clear 
  that this politics will have to go. For them running risks is a way of life. 
  One of them casually told a dissident he was sheltering, &quot;The local LTTE 
  area leader is coming to lunch. I will take you to another house and bring you 
  back later.&quot;</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The following episode gives an insight into 
  their spirit. A young man trying to go to Colombo was turned back by LTTE sentries 
  in the Wanni. The young sentry boys would only say, &quot;No travel for the 
  time being. Orders are orders. Don't think we are like the other groups.&quot; 
  The young man went back a little and was wondering what to do, when an old Wanni 
  farmer came that way. &quot;In a spot of trouble aren't you? What, going back 
  home? Can you make it? said the old man, and waited musingly. The young man 
  said that he had no choice. &quot;Don't be stupid&quot;, said the old man, &quot;Go 
  through this lane.&nbsp; When you come to the end of it, there is a house. The 
  woman there may shout at you. Ignore her and turn left into the paddy field. 
  Go straight. When you get to the end, left again, and you will be back on the 
  main road. Thereafter, no problem.&quot; The young man made it.</span> </p>
<h4><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;<a
name="_Toc515969809">2.7 Influence of Government Policy &amp; Southern Reactions:</a></span></h4>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;We have dealt with this matter in various 
  places - particularly the nature of the military response and the general refusal 
  to understand the problem of minorities. We shall briefly dwell on a related 
  aspect. This is the suppression and stifling of any potential to provide an 
  alternative to the dominant politics by Tamils themselves. We have maintained 
  that a solution could only emerge through a politics where the human and democratic 
  rights of all persons in this country are respected. For this to happen those 
  Tamils who feel that they want to live in this country with the Sinhalese and 
  Muslims and make legitimate demands for the well-being of their people, should 
  be respected and their credibility upheld. What is happening now is the opposite. 

  This again and again boosts up the Tigers as the only answer to this government.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;An important manner in which this happens 
  is when leaders of the local community are unable to make any impact on the 
  torture and disappearance of thousands of detainees or to provide the community 
  with any assurances. In the Batticaloa area over a hundred young persons picked 
  up from refugee camps are unaccounted for. Peoples' representatives raising 
  the matter are bullied and humiliated. In the Amparai District when the appearance 
  of thirty odd headless bodies was reported in `the Island', the inquiry took 
  the form of intimidating leading local citizens to sign a denial. In the meantime 
  the LTTE successfully ambushed an STF patrol in Panama. Whom would the people 
  turn to for leadership under such conditions?</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The use made by the government of Tamil groups 
  is so counter productive as to actually add to the LTTE's prestige. A mature 
  government genuinely wanting to expose the LTTE would have insisted that these 
  groups show more spunk and fight for the interests of their people. Instead 
  it has used their weapons to discredit them and add to their humiliation. MP's 
  from these groups prefer to forget that they were militants with a cause. They 
  are regularly taken on ministerial visits to the East and mostly observe a silence 
  on the indignities being heaped on the people there by government forces. On 
  a recent visit of a multi-party delegation, one representative of a militant 
  group introduced himself to the Colonel as someone working closely with the 
  Brigadier in some other area, whose conduct leaves much to be desired. Another 
  member of the delegation asked the Colonel about missing persons. The Colonel 
  replied casually, that such things must be expected to happen.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;An elderly civilian who was recently appointed 
  MP for the Batticaloa District, whose appointment the EPRLF publicly objected 
  to, was the only person to question the Minister of Defence about persons taken 
  from refugee camps and who were now missing. The army initially admitted taking 
  over hundred and reduced the number to about 30 later. The Minister maintained 
  that he cannot account for persons the army does not admit as having taken. 
  The elderly MP persisted on his demand for some time. But his younger ex-militant 
  colleagues kept silent without supporting him.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;At another meeting of an all party delegation 
  with the Minister of Defence, the representative of a Left party complained 
  about 30 or so Tamils who went to Amparai, were detained and about whom nothing 
  more was heard until that time. The Minister asked sternly, &quot;Are they your 
  cadre?&quot; On being told that they were ordinary civilians, the Minister replied, 
  &quot;If they are your cadre I will personally make some arrangement. Otherwise 
  you have no business to ask.&quot;</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Trincomalee is an area about which Tamils 
  are very sensitive. Instead of trying to give Tamils confidence by handling 
  it carefully, it is managed by a Brigadier responsible for several hundred disappearances. 
  The Brigadier enjoys wide powers in this area where Tamils have numerically 
  been the greatest sufferers over the years. We have commented on current rehabilitation 
  efforts in <a
href="\uthrj\Reports\Report5\Report5.htm">Report No.5</a>. On a visit of the delegation 
  above in October, they were taken to a multi-racial housing scheme sponsored 
  by the NGO Sarvodaya. It turned out that though shramadana (volunteer) labour 
  is provided by Tamils and Muslims, practically all the houses being built are 
  for Sinhalese.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;It was explained to them there that the Brigadier 
  was a no-nonsense man who had brought all NGO's involved in rehabilitation under 
  his control. On non-discriminatory principles, the Brigadier had decided on 
  the allocation of Sarvodaya houses. First to the displaced persons of 1987, 
  nearly all of whom just happened to be Sinhalese. Curiously the numerically 
  much larger body of persons displaced in 1983-86 and 1990 are mostly all Tamils. 
  This adds to our earlier insight about government policy in Trincomalee.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;One Tamil group, the EPRLF, appears to have 
  privately taken an independent stand on the goings on in Trincomalee, presumably 
  using its connections with the Indian Government. Although there was no public 
  protest from any Tamil group, there were angry references in the press on attempts 
  being made to relocate Sinhalese. During the third week or so of October, some 
  persons working for EPRLF MPs were abducted and evidently roughed up in Colombo. 
  A complaint made to a very senior member of the government is said to have brought 
  about the response: &quot;There are forces outside the control of the government 
  who are unhappy about the President talking to Tamil groups.&quot; During this 
  period it is reported that EPRLF MP's felt rather intimidated about leaving 
  Sravasti hostel and going to Parliament. Further inquiries revealed that the 
  `force' concerned was a Tamil group well known to the EPRLF, and by no means 
  outside the ambit of the government.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;During the IPKF presence, the PLOTE kept 
  its distance and preserved a measure of independence. In January, the Sri Lankan 
  forces helped the LTTE to dislodge them from their stronghold in the Wanni. 
  Following the outbreak of war in June the PLOTE succumbed to severe pressure 
  to work with the forces - some of their cadre were knifed by soldiers in Kalmunai. 
  Later PLOTE cadre were posted with Sri Lankan soldiers at sentry points in Vavuniya. 
  For some time they tried to curb the indignities to which civilians were subject 
  to by soldiers. But they lacked even the means to complain to a responsible 
  person about the conduct of individual soldiers. In turn they became frustrated 
  as people grumbled about PLOTE cadre in the same breath in which they complained 
  about soldiers. Recently there have been a number of complaints about extortion 
  by PLOTE cadre.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;To make matters worse there is no move in 
  the South to understand the &quot;Tamil Problem.&quot;&nbsp; Numerous articles 
  and editorials are appearing about politico-military approaches, and human rights 
  organisations questioning the treatment of Tamils are being attacked. But no 
  one is asking what is happening to the Tamil community and the cost to the country 
  of its destruction. What progress has been made in making the minorities feel 
  part of the country? In fact despite Tamil being elevated to an official language, 
  the position of the Tamils has worsened. Furthermore, as a general offshoot 
  of insensitivity and repression there are vast segments of disenchantment. A 
  very large number of these people outside the North-East who have not seen a 
  Tiger in the flesh and know little about them except that they have seriously 
  embarrassed the government, hail the Tigers as their vicarious avengers. This 
  group includes Sinhalese and people like Malayali's from Kotahena who were victims 
  of violence unleashed against Tamils in July 1983. Such is the alienation created 
  by the government in many places, that subjective feelings about the Tigers 
  override the key question - what it would mean to them if their own people adopt 
  the politics of the Tigers?</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Thus when an elder-statesman representing 
  the Hill Country Tamils who has been a senior member of the government for over 
  a dozen of years, asserts that the Tigers are the representatives of the people 
  of the North-East, one needs to consider his own community's experience. He 
  has a number of times been quoted privately as saying that the government would 
  not give the Tamils anything voluntarily. Interestingly, his assertion came 
  as a response to a question about the Muslim minority's position. (Sunday Times 
  - 9.12.90). He cannot surely mean that Muslims should be part of the North-East 
  in the same manner that his community is part of the South.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Once more it will hardly come as a surprise 
  if, having strengthened and legitimised the Tigers to this point, the government 
  would be overawed into taking them on as partners with sole control over the 
  North-East.</span> <br>

<h4><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp; <a name="_Toc515969811">to politics:</a></span></h4>
<p><br>
  <span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;We concentrate on a salient feature that is 
  informative. Despite the increasing repression and intolerance, the government, 
  like others around the world, retains a capacity to appeal to its political 
  rivals or even enemies, and use them when it can find a common cause or a question 
  of common interest. Thus when this war broke out, the president summoned Tamil 
  opposition groups and had talks with them. He could get even the SLFP which 
  was challenging the legitimacy of his power, and together with other opposition 
  groups, send them to India to sell the war. He could give regular, well-publicised, 
  cordial receptions to Tamil delegations to defuse their complaints about the 
  forces' conduct. He could summon an All Party Conference&nbsp; and sit with 
  opponents, taking his own time evolving a political solution. Even media publicity 
  given to the views of some of his critics, like the leader of the Tamil Congress, 
  is tolerated. But like everywhere else, there is a price for going too far as 
  recently the EPRLF and the SLMC discovered. In the West it may be telephone 
  tapping or surveillance for the purpose of black mail, or, particularly in the 
  US, a rigorous scrutiny of one's income tax returns. In this country, it could 
  be a visit from forces &quot;outside the government's control.&quot; The point 
  is that such a relationship with opponents gives the government some options, 
  including that of putting a good face on capitulation.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The Tigers, on the other hand, being the 
  accredited leaders of a small community with few resources, lack the ability 
  to use their opponents even in a crisis. In 1986 it demolished its rival groups 
  in the middle of a war allowing the enemy to make a rapid advance. When some 
  other militant leaders appealed to the LTTE to state its conditions for co-operation, 
  these requests were ignored. When after the IPKF's arrival, a breakaway faction 
  of the EPRLF reportedly sent an emissary to discuss peace with the Tigers, the 
  emissary failed to reappear. Following the war with the IPKF, there was a division 
  among former members of a defunct Left wing group with one faction wanting to 
  do nothing and the other wanting to support the LTTE. Recently the LTTE has 
  detained several tens of these person who were simply staying at home and they 
  are unaccounted for.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Following the outbreak of the current war 
  with the Sri Lankan forces, there was a mood among many ex-militants living 
  abroad to work with the LTTE. News of the LTTE's repression at home put an end 
  to this.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Why is it that a group like the LTTE in a 
  strong position to be generous, and badly needing support, preferred to brutally 
  spurn every opportunity for co-operation, and prefer instead desperate measures 
  such as cannibalising the social fabric and plucking up children in large numbers 
  to keep the show going?&nbsp; An important part of the answer is its use of 
  the twin concepts of the sacred group and traitor to promote its appeal - a 
  potent weapon inherited from the TULF and later used against it. the price paid 
  was a spiralling cycle of repression, desperate measures and a resort to mysticism 
  to explain setbacks, contradictions and somersaults. It is hardly surprising 
  that any open discussion that would be the price of co-operation, is anathema 
  to the LTTE. Take some of the links in history. The LTTE once tried to ingratiate 
  itself with India by boasting with little subtlety that it had given India a 
  foothold in this country. It went to war with India to avoid any power sharing. 
  This was when the other groups became active with Indian Forces. Forced into 
  a corner, the LTTE made a deal with the Sri Lankan government, purportedly because 
  of whose perfidy it fought India, and helped the Sri Lankan forces to decimate 
  its rivals. Now its rivals have been cornered into working with the Sri Lankan 
  government. How does one sort out treachery and patriotism from this mess except 
  by asserting a sacred prerogative?</span> </p>

<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;This is given further substance by the fact 
  that the LTTE has repeatedly shown a willingness to ignore its own rhetoric 
  and sit and make deals with apparently sworn enemies. It made an appeal to India 
  soon after the outbreak of war in 1987 and once more it calls for Indian recognition 
  and talks of not accepting an international peace effort that circumvents India. 
  Soon after hammering the TELO in 1986, it consorted with Sri Lankan army officers 
  and cabinet members on television. Later it made a deal with President Premadasa 
  on the basis of their common patriotic interest in keeping outsiders (namely 
  Indians)&nbsp; out. Thus despite the rhetoric it was not serious about enemies 
  without. But no quarter was given to any hint of dissent within. It was not 
  seeking the right of Tamils to be an independent self respecting community, 
  but was seeking a sub contract from the Indian and Sri Lankan governments to 
  be given sole charge of Tamils. Its main enemy was the independent spirit of 
  Tamil people themselves.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Another feature of Sri Lankan as well as 
  international politics is that politicians authorise or even use accredited 
  agents to do their dirty work and themselves keep aloof. These jobs are done 
  by agencies for intelligence and subversion, special units within the police 
  or by private goons in the pay of politicians. Thus President Premadasa could 
  authorise his forces to do their stuff and himself visit the victims with beaming 
  benevolence, paying his respects to kovils and vihares to the whirr of TV cameras,&nbsp; 
  talk about rehabilitation and issue orders for more supplies. While his forces 
  are waging a brutal war against the LTTE or the JVP, he could on his own account 
  call them for talks.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;With the LTTE there is no separation between 
  the military and the political arm. Even in such unjustifiable actions such 
  as the expulsion of Muslims from the North, its political arm, the PFLT, was 
  at the forefront. By contrast none of the Muslim parties talking to Tamil groups 
  in Colombo have any visible connections with the Jihad or the Muslim home guards 
  in the East. This is again indicative of the LTTE's nature. It is not that this 
  makes the government morally superior. No disregard for human rights will work. 
  But for the short term it gives a certain amount of flexibility to avert a precipitate 
  plunge into disaster. When the cost is proving too high, the government retains 
  the ability to sweep the dirty work under the carpet and shake hands with the 
  enemy.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The LTTE by contrast has left itself no options 
  to deal with the Muslims as a self respecting&nbsp; people. They are a very 
  different category from Sinhalese colonists. The latter are essentially poor 
  and exploited people settled in the East by well heeled promoters preferring 
  the flesh pots of Colombo.&nbsp; They are not integrated communities with deep 
  roots in the soil and who are articulate, having produced men of education and 
  influence. They may be killed or driven out as refugees, and the government, 
  if it proves expedient, could afford to drop them and let their grievances fester 
  for decades. It is very different with the Muslims in the North-East. They know 
  and feel that they belong to the region as much as the Tamils. They are integrated 
  communities with deep roots. Their contribution to Tamil culture and&nbsp; scholarship 
  is substantial. Further, a majority can afford to become tired and indifferent 
  as is now symptomatic of the Sinhalese. They could cut their losses and there 
  would still be much left to be rescued. It is very different for a minority 
  - in particular for the Muslims of the North-East. What is worse, the Tigers 
  have taught everyone with a grievance that to succeed easily against the likes 
  of the government or themselves, they need to imitate their methods. Like Tamil 
  dissidents, Muslims cannot be marginalised by branding them traitors. The Tigers 
  forgot that like what Sinhalese governments did earlier, they too were dealing 

  with a minority.</span> </p>
<h4><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;<a
name="_Toc515969812">2.9 Indian Links:</a></span></h4>
<p><br>
  <span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Shortly after the outbreak of the June war, 
  some very senior Tiger leaders addressed a seminar at the University of Jaffna. 
  A question was posed about the LTTE's foreign policy, particularly in relation 
  to Mr.Karunanidhi - Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu. A very high ranking LTTE personage 
  made an audible impromptu blurt of something obscene in reference to Karunanidhi, 
  comparing him unfavourably with Amirthalingam. Those near the front clearly 
  heard the remark. This was quickly followed up by a political spokesman with 
  something printable. The audience was thus given an insight into the cynicism 
  and anger governing mutual relations between Tigers and their actual and aspiring 
  Indian godfathers. On the surface it would appear that the Tigers have much 
  to thank Karunanidhi for. Despite the fact that the Tigers kept Karunanidhi 
  at a distance when MGR was alive, he had campaigned for the Tigers when Indian 
  soldiers were dying fighting them, he deliberately slighted the Indian army, 
  he was lenient, to say the least, with Tiger operations in Tamil Nadu and even 
  faced widespread accusations over the killing of EPRLF leaders in Madras on 
  19th June.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Their relations with Subramaniam Swamy too 
  show similar symptoms. Mr.Swamy has been quoted in the press to the effect that 
  he had made the connection for the Tigers to train with the Israeli Mossad, 
  that does a thriving business in helping some of the worst governments to suppress 
  both violent and non-violent liberation movements. The cause of his present 
  disillusionment with the LTTE is attributed by him, on the face of it, to personal 
  displeasure with Balasingam of the LTTE. It is in the nature of these politicians 
  to pick up something and drop it on mere fancy. The level of their sense of 
  responsibility is such that the fate of a whole people may hinge on their moods 
  and&nbsp; on personal considerations. The LTTE too may not be able to understand 
  that these individuals do not have the capacity to do everything it requires 
  of them. To the LTTE, they are tools to the goal of an agreement with Delhi 
  - not for influence in India but for Delhi's seal on a sub-contract giving the 
  Tigers exclusive rights over the fate of Tamils in the North-East.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The opportunism of Indian politicians who 
  play with such phenomena and strengthen them without the sense of responsibility 
  to understand what it is all about, can cost India dearly. As it is, the Tigers 

  have an image far in excess of their material strength - What is after all left 
  of Ceylon Tamil society? Its apparent success will inspire groups with grievances 
  to imitate its methods. Perhaps after the phenomenon collapses - if only out 
  of sheer material exhaustion - some future Indian artists would represent goddess 
  Kali with the face of a Tigress.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;India still appears to view the Tamil problem 
  exclusively in terms of its foreign policy aims. It is yet to understand what 
  is happening to the Tamils and take responsibility for past mishandling. Apart 
  from the needless suffering caused to civilians, it has not admitted responsibility 
  for the cruel fate suffered by TNA conscripts and the fact that arms left behind 
  by India were used in the massacres of Muslim civilians. Until there is a change, 
  there will be more tragedies - both here and in India.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Those in the South who spend too much time 
  accusing India of foul play, should face up to the fact that it was July 1983 
  that opened the floodgates for this ugly episode. If they would only actively 
  face up to their responsibility - which they have consistently failed to do 
  - there will be no room for Indian interference. They cannot bomb civilians&nbsp; 
  and slaughter by the thousands and think realistically that nothing would move 
  in India. They fail to understand that they do not have the same choices and 
  influence as in 1956.</span> </p>
<h4><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;<a
name="_Toc515969813">2.10 Why did the Tamil Intellectuals Fail?</a></span></h4>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;In closing we present the views of a young 
  man who was an active member of the militant cause half a dozen of years ago. 
  He is not an academic, but through the hard school of life he has earned highly 
  enviable skills that would have made him a millionaire in the West in no time. 
  But he remains in the country because of a strong emotional and political commitment. 
  Being fluent in all three languages, he roams the country in various guises, 
  active now in human rights work. We present his views as something seldom heard 
  and extremely valuable in understanding the crisis:</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;&quot;A large number of Tamils are in a state 
  of despair, sitting helplessly at what may be the threshold of their final doom. 
  Apart from the vindictive havoc brought about&nbsp; by the Sri Lankan forces, 
  there is internal repression which does not allow us space even to re-evaluate. 
  I blame the Tamil intellectuals for this state of affairs. Today they wring 
  their hands and say what could we have done when our lives were threatened? 
  Was this always true? The signs were there a decade ago and the intellectuals 
  could have checked it.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;&quot;The massacre of over a hundred and 
  fifty Sinhalese, including women and children, at Anuradhapura in May 1985, 
  was a crime that blackened the name of the militant cause by bringing it down 
  to the level of the Sri Lankan forces. Again the intellectuals say that they 
  were either unwilling or scared to condemn it. Then there is the other dishonest 
  line that we had frequently&nbsp; heard from intellectuals: &quot;Don't criticise 
  them openly. After all they risk their lives. Tell them privately, they will 
  listen.&quot; It is a fact that a large number from all groups gave their lives. 
  But what is happening today is an insult to all of them. I know from a friend 
  who was close to Das of the TELO, that when the Indian RAW approached him about 
  carrying out the Anuradhapura massacre, he was horrified. The LTTE agreed at 
  least partly because it wanted to endear itself to the RAW, above the TELO. 
  When we look back at how the LTTE had worked, how it systematically and patiently 
  targeted individuals who were a challenge to it, it had a very clear mind where 
  its priorities were concerned. Its record in this respect is far more impressive 
  than its military one.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;&quot;Yet again and again many intellectuals 
  have seen the whole Tamil cause as banking on this organisation, repeatedly 
  trying to polish the surface of what was rotten within, and at the same time 
  giving an intellectual polish to their cowardice. A key reason why they did 
  not see an alternative to the LTTE stemmed from the psychology of their class. 
  There were healthy attempts at alternatives to the LTTE, but the intellectuals 
  refused to see them and thus weakened them. If these attempts had been supported, 
  the fate of the Tamils would have been different.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;&quot;Take the EPRLF for instance, which 
  had started showing symptoms of rot by 1984. In 1985 two EPRLF men shot dead 
  a psychiatric patient in Chunnakam. There was a public protest backed by the 
  LTTE. This was amongst the exceptionally few killings for which the EPRLF was 
  responsible before the Accord. The EPRLF agreed to inquire into the incident 
  and punish the culprits. The heads of the culprits were shaven and they were 
  tied to posts publicly at the Chunnakam market. They were removed only when 
  the LTTE instigated the crowd to stone them. Has the LTTE ever admitted a mistake 
  or held a public inquiry into a complaint against itself? When the TELO was 
  inhumanly decimated and the intellectuals were silent, the EPRLF organised a 
  public protest. One was always able to walk into an EPRLF camp, say anything 
  about them and walk out in one piece. Until the time they were banned, they 
  did keep a space open for the public to protest. But the intellectuals largely 
  despised them, seeing them through spectacles coloured by caste and class.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;&quot;But this was not the case with ordinary 
  common people who have throughout shown a sense of decency and displayed guts. 
  I need not repeat the many incidents where ordinary people collectively and 
  individually refused to bow down to oppression. This, despite the fact that 
  there was no one to protect them. At the end of 1986 when the LTTE had launched 
  a hunt for EPRLF members on the run, a friend of mine in a village in Jaffna 
  whom I was visiting, was asked about me. My friend told the questioner the truth, 
  that I never had any connection. Another LTTE member stepped in and slammed 
  my friend in the face, causing him to fall. He got up and went home bleeding 
  from the mouth. Later he went to the bank and cleared all his savings. He gave 
  it all to me and told me to get his family out of there if anything happened 
  to him. He then went to the local LTTE camp, pushed the sentries aside and walked 
  in. He then beat two others who came to stop him. Next he caught the person 
  who had assaulted him, slammed him against the wall and beat him. He then told 
  the LTTE men that he had been born in that village and that he would continue 
  to live there. He did that and the LTTE did not touch him. The LTTE was often 
  afraid of such determination. What was he after all? - an ordinary son of the 
  soil. Our intellectuals never measured up to such </span><span style='color:#990000'>levels. 
  My friend is abroad now.&quot; <a href="#_Toc515969802">[Top]</a></span></p>
