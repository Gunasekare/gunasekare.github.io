<h3 align="center"><a name="_Toc517799969"><span lang=EN-GB>The Snares of Violence</span></a></h3>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>The recent spate of human rights violations cannot be understood 
  without c some knowledge of the motivations and mutual relations of the various 
  factions that bear arms. India&#146;s sponsorship of Tamil militant groups in 
  1983 and the manner in which the latter were militarised at the expense of political 
  vision has been written about elsewhere. Help given t6 Tamil militant groups 
  received widespread approval. In consequence of the 1983 racial violence and 
  the subsequent military action by the Sri Lankan state, the Tamil minority was 
  seen as defenseless. This militarisation reflected itself in the ruthless manner 
  in which internal dissent within militant groups was dealt with. In early 1985 
  the Indian press came out with sensational revelations about how the PLOTE had 
  killed several of its own cadres on Indian soil. Dissident sources have given 
  figures varying from several tens upwards. Less well known, but well authenticated, 
  are several internal killings within other militant groups.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>By the middle of 1986, the LTTE had eliminated the TELO from 
  the militant scene and its bid for sole dominance became evident. The number 
  of TELO cadres killed by the LTTE is put at 90 upwards. Leading EPRLF men in 
  Jaffna told a senior Citizens&#146; Committee figure that its leadership in 
  Madras had asked the LTTE leadership for its terms of cooperation. But no answer 
  had been forthcoming.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>It was generally assumed that the LTTE would take on the EPRLF 
  at an opportune moment. In November 1986 the EPRLF confronted the LTTE politically 
  by backing the outcry over the disappeared student Vijithiran. Knowing that 
  the LTTE would respond militarily, the EPRLF was singularly unprepared. By 14th 
  December 1986, the LTTE had taken on the EPRLF. In Jaffna, the EPRLF vacated 
  its camps leaving behind large quantities of weapons. Outside Jaffna, particularly 
  in the Eastern province, fighting between the LTTE and the EPRLF continued sporadically. 
  Perhaps out of deference to a feeling of public horror at events during the 
  LTTE-TELO clash of Nay, scenes of public outrage were not repeated. But several 
  EPRLF cadres were killed. A number were tortured, particularly for information 
  on hidden weapons.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>It is notable that a large number of members of the public, 
  particularly from the lower classes, took great risks in providing shelter and 
  succour for TELO and EPRLF cadres on the run. Many of them are the very same 
  persons who did likewise for LTTE supporters, when they felt hunted after October 
  1988. The EPRLF, which was then not known for notoriety in dealing with dissent, 
  failed to settle the costly breach between its leader Padmanabha, and the leader 
  of its military wing, Douglas Devananda. This provided the LTTE its opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>It was widely felt that the LTTE&#146;s actions had seriously 
  weakened the militants. This received confirmation when the Sri Lankan armed 
  forces made rapid gains in early 1987. The EPRLF had been becoming increasingly 
  effective in the East in the few months before its disbandment.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>At the end of March 1987 the LTTE&#146;s Jaffna leader, Kittu, 
  lost a leg in a bomb attack. The attackers were not identified. Widespread speculation 
  remains that the attack was prompted by internal differences. On the following 
  evening, 18 EPRLF prisoners held at the Brown Road LTTE camp were killed. The 
  LTTE described the incident as an escape attempt. The</span></p>
<p><span> </span>&#145;Saturday Review&#146; quoting LTTE sources, said that in 
  the few days following Kittu&#146;s incident, about 50 prisoners held in LTTE 
  camps were killed. The BBC reported a higher figure.</p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>From March 1987 the fighting between the Sri Lankan army and 
  the LTTE became increasingly vicious. A large number of Tamil civilians fell 
  victim to aerial bombing and shelling by Sri Lankan forces. Over 200 Sinhalese 
  civilians fell victim to two attacks during the course of the week commencing 
  with the Sinhala/Tamil New Year of April 1987. One was a massacre in Kituluttuwa,near 
  Trincomalee. The other was the car-bomb attack in Colombo.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>The feeling of relief with which the IPKF was welcomed by 
  Tamil civilians in July 1987 and the subsequent events have been described elsewhere.</span></p>
<p>In the face of an increasingly unfavourable balance of forces, the LTTE chose 
  to shore up its position by making rhetorical claims of exclusiveness. Other 
  militants were branded as traitors, who had in addition become agents of India. 
  The last must be viewed in the light of the LTTE itself having received arms 
  and training from India. Its leader  was resident in India until early 1987. 
  Also, facilities in India were crucial for the war against the Sri Lankan state. 
  However, while the LTTE opposed the physical presence of Indian forces, in part 
  because of the threat to its claims of exclusiveness, it kept asking for additional 
  (and more sophisticated) arms from India.</p>
<p>At another level, the LTTE quite successfully carved out an image for itself 
  through extraordinary displays of military prowess and some sensational acts 
  of violence. This was underlined by the suicidal valour of the Black Tigers; 
  the attack on Kankesanturai harbour (22nd April 1987); Miller&#146;s suicide 
  attack on Nelliady camp (5th July 1987) and the surprise assault of 12th September 
  1987 in the Eastern province, which left a reported 70 militants from other 
  groups dead. The last took place in the relatively relaxed atmosphere soon after 
  the Accord. Man of the dead were unprepared and unarmed. While the LTTE acquired 
  an image, its political objectives in the face of ground realities became more 
  nebulous. Nevertheless, it also exposed the political weakness of other forces, 
  particularly the Indian and Sri Lankan states. The LTTE could keep up its reputation 
  only at great cost to the civilian population. It too lost the ability to deal 
  diplomatically, particularly with other  militant groups.</p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>For the other militant groups, given their past political 
  and military failures, an Indian presence provided an expeditious means of re­establishing 
  themselves. People generally acknowledged the crucial role played by other militant 
  groups in keeping back the Sri Lankan forces. After the arrival of the IPKF, 
  the other militant groups began to be redeployed, often in close proximity to 
  IPKF camps. Within a month internecine killings had started. Instead of making 
  a political approach to win over the people, the message people usually got 
  in dealings with other militant groups was that the people were being blamed 
  for the fate they suffered at the hands of the LTTE. The hatred and thirst for 
  revenge they felt towards the LTTE thus seemed to extend to the people who were 
  classed with the LTTE. This view came to be reflected in the attitudes of the 
  IPKF after the October offensive. All this went towards reinforcing the LTTE&#146;s 
  propaganda claim, that the other militants were traitors and anti-social elements, 
  once rejected by the people and now making their appearance under IPKF patronage.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>Such a view of the civilians persisted even after the EPRLF 
  became the major party representing the Tamils in the North-East provincial 
  government in November 1988. In day-to-day dealings with EPRLF cadres, ordinary 
  people were accused of being pro-LTTE, or of having stood by idly while the 
  LTTE decimated them in the past. The killing of a large number of LTTE supporters 
  and sympathisers left the feeling that a very crude military approach was being 
  tried, with the complicity of the IPKF.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>Perhaps far more serious than blunders of other parties have 
  been the blunders of India, earlier seen as lacking in principle and now seen 
  to be &#151;lacking in objective as well. The readiness by India to descend 
  to forms of expediency with apparently no political or moral scruples has left 
  the IPKF with an unenviable task. One must remember that the IPKF was welcomed 
  in July 1987 with almost universal approbation. When Indian officials say that 
  several hundred Indian soldiers died for the Tamils of Ceylon, it undoubtedly 
  makes sense to Indian ears. But given the enormity of civilian suffering in 
  the face of Indian military action, this would &#151;sound an insult to the 
  average Tamil, adding salt to the wound.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>True, a number of Indian soldiers died trying to maintain 
  services. The &#151;life of an Indian soldier here is as tense, unpleasant and 
  hazardous as it is for many ordinary civilians. But seen from here, the reverses 
  suffered by the Indian army were largely a consequence of a lack of moral and 
  political vision. One does know that many Indian soldiers and officers are often 
  courteous, obliging and do not relish the reputation of their organisation. 
  But faced with a situation, gut instincts seem to take over.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>India has consistently and indignantly denied allegations 
  of torture and inhumane practices by its forces from international organisations, 
  within and outside the country. The existence of such practices are so well 
  known here, that privately many Indian officials would defend them on the grounds 
  of expediency. That is at least a sure sign that they are aware that what they 
  are doing is wrong - something for which India has rightly taken the Sri Lankan 
  government to task in international fora earlier. India would never dare to 
  argue before the world the need for inhumane practices, nor would it defend 
  its use of such practices. Perhaps the fundamental error is that of trying to 
  accomplish a political task without respect for people. Screams and groans from 
  victims<sub></sub>heard by residents near IPKF camps, remain part of our day-to-day 
  reality.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>Even if one grants that the IPKF is faced with an incorrigible 
  adversary, the question remains: Could a country such as India, with enormous 
  intellectual, material and spiritual resources, make a plea to be judged at 
  the same level as that of youngsters, whose experience from their early teens 
  has taught them to rely on little else besides their gun? Would India defend 
  the practices of some of the worst regimes of the world?</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>A poignant comment on the current situation comes in a leaflet 
  bearing the title &#147;We ask forgiveness from the people&#148;, signed &#147;Those 
  who left the EPRLF&#148;. It is addressed to their former comrades. Such crudely 
  stenciled leaflets from the underground remain the only form of free expression. 
  Some excerpts are quoted below in translation:</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>&#147;&#133;..Because conflicts within our organisation could 
  not be settled in a regular manner, many responsible comrades like Davidson, 
  Chelian, Devananda and Das left with broken hearts. It is because of the resulting 
  weak state of our organisation that the Tigres attacked us, and not because 
  the People instigated the Tigers&#148;.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>&#147;But today you are using your armed might to take revenge 
  on the people who only want peace and democracy. This will only push them once 
  again to the state of accepting that the politics of the Tigers was right. It 
  is not just the former supporters of the Tigers, but even thousands who supported 
  us will be driven by your present conduct to the side of the Tigers&#148;.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>&#147;Instead of trying to show that you are more democratic 
  than the Tigers, you are trying to articulate your politics by showing that 
  you. Are more brutish than the Tigers. We are greatly distressed by this&#148;.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>&#147;Dear leader Comrade Padmanabha. In your thirst for a 
  rational form of politics and in your desire to build up the EPRLF as an organisation 
  to articulate it, you used to roam Tamil Nadu, suitcase in hand, sleeping on 
  the streets. What are you doing when the very people for whose benefit you built 
  up this organisation, spit upon it? Have you accepted this line, or is it that 
  you have no authority to speak?&#148;</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>&#147;Comrades. Posters with beautiful slogans, red flags 
  and sporting of beards cannot alone run a liberation movement. On the contrary, 
  ever:</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>comrade who bears arms must possess the discipline of loving 
  the people&#148;.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>&#147;Your confounding &#145;red flag and revenge politics&#146; 
  with &#145;liberation politics&#146; has belittled and devalued the noble sentiments 
  you uttered in bygone days&#148;.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>&#147;We appeal to you comrades within the EPRLF&#146; who 
  love the people, think even at this eleventh hour. The arms of the foreigner 
  which you bear in your hands will one day be taken away. What then will be your 
  state?&#148;</span><a href="#_Toc517799969">[Top]</a></p>
