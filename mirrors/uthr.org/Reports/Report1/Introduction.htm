lang=EN-GB></span></h3>
<h1><span lang=EN-GB> &nbsp; </span></h1>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>The wake of the Indian offensive of October 1987 saw civilian 
  deaths and disappearances on a large scale. The death toll is put at above 1500 
  by NGO sources. By all indications the strategy of the LTTE seemed to be one 
  of wearing down the IPKF by guerrilla attacks and by paralysing the general 
  administration of the North and East. A death penalty was presumed for those 
  collaborating with the IPKF. Interpretations varied with local leaderships. 
  The IPKF&#146;s strategy until the Provincial Council elections were announced 
  in October appeared to be one 6f pressurising the LTTE through military action 
  to come forward and negotiate for a position of influence under the terms of 
  the Indo-Lanka Accord. To this end, India hoped to use other militant groups, 
  all of whom, with the LTTE, had at one time been trained and armed by India. 

  Shortly after the October offensive, notices went up near IPKF camps calling 
  upon LTTE cadres to surrender and take up the &#145;golden opportunity&#146; 
  of rehabilitation. About the same time notices also went up calling members 
  of other militant groups to report. It is known that a large number of member&amp; 
  of other militant groups were disillusioned, especially after the LTTE cracked 
  down on them in 1986, and they had tried hard to get back into civilian life 
  or had plans of going abroad. Despite hard feelings against the LTTE, these 
  persons were generally intent on resisting being dragooned into carrying arms 
  again. But as it turned out, many of them were given little choice. Several 
  of them who turned to extortion of bus passengers, embarrassingly close to IPKF 
  camps, openly admitted that they would go abroad once they were in possession 
  of the required funds. To many of them, this was the only realistic alternative 
  to a life of the hunted.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-GB>An important group of persons who had taken over several of 
  the functions of erstwhile elected MPs were members of Citizens&#146; Committees, 
  many of whom were elderly. By the end of 1986, most of those not having credentials 

  acceptable to the LTTE were obliged to resign. Those remaining had to accept, 
  at least implicitly, the LTTE&#146;s political dominance. Nevertheless several 
  of these people, like the Mallakam Citizens&#146; Committee, did to a commendable 
  extent preserve their independence and continued their humanitarian work with 
  refugees. The Mallakam Citizens&#146; Committee decided to dissolve itself in 
  March 1986, following the assassination of its senior member, TULF politician 
  and former chairman of the defunct DDC, Mr. Nadarajah.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>Several Citizens&#146; Committee leaders were used by the 
  IPKF as go&#151;between in negotiations with the LTTE. On the whole, Citizens&#146; 
  Committee leaders gave voice to a widespread feeling that there could be no 
  settlement without LTTE participation. Again, as with the majority of people, 
  the role of the IPKF was accepted as a fait accompli, and was not challenged. 
  Theirs was a passive demand for the antagonists to end hostilities and put a 
  stop to civilian suffering.</span></p>
<p>The manner in which Indian policy used the divided loyalties of a fractured 
  society served to deepen both new and traditional antagonisms, bringing about 
  suspicion, irrational hatred and murder. The opposite of  the rehabilitation 
  of the militant youth was set in motion. Many of them  were forced to flee or 
  to carry arms. Privately, Indian officers were</p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>often contemptuous of these unfortunate persons they were 
  trying to use. Whether they would be given any power too depended on the LTTE. 
  This was amply demonstrated when the September 28th 1987 agreement with the 
  LTTE gave no representation to the other groups on the interim council.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>From the end of 1987 the LTTE launched a campaign of assassination 
  against civilians suspected of being collaborators with India or potential opponents 
  of LTTE. Several of those killed were persons who as Citizen&#146;s Committee 
  members had dealings with the IPKF to sort out the day-to-day needs of ordinary 
  people (such needs arose from arrests of relatives, or from the gaining of access 
  to homes they had fled during the war). Such persons were of a traditional political 
  mould and often acted on the basis that whoever held power was to be respected 
  or honoured This was offensive to the LTTE when the power was not held by themselves.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>Many of these assassinated were former members of other militant 
  groups, killed on suspicion of wanting to re associate with their former units. 
  To many LTTE sympathisers this policy seemed justified in view of India&#146;s 
  position on the matter. But for members of other militant groups it became a 
  matter of choosing between a longer life or a shorter one. In the course of 
  such a utilitarian approach, the IPKF&#146;s attitude towards civilians was 
  instrumental. Civilian resentment was treated as a sign of approval of the LTTE. 
  A major cause of this resentment resulted from reprisals against civilians in 
  response to attacks on the IPKF by the LTTE. There came about a cumulative process 
  in which the IPKF began to treat civilians as pro-LTTE, and the gulf of distrust 
  widened. Civilians too found Indian ire against pro-LTTE sentiments puzzling, 
  especially since India had given material and propaganda support for the LTTE 
  scarcely one year earlier. India started blaming the civilians for the conspicuous 
  failure of a policy of which India had been the prime mover, and in the course 
  of which civilians had been marginalised. When India declared a ceasefire in 
  September 1987 and called for Provincial Council elections, the tone of the 
  Indian Ambassador Mr. J.N. Dixit&#146;s message, though unreal, was one of holding 
  the civilians to ransom in order to bring the LTTE to the negotiating table.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>When the LTTE did not come forward, India decided on backing 
  the EPRLF for the provincial leadership. There followed a series of killings 
  of persons seen to be sympathetic to the LTTE. Those killed sometimes included 
  relatives. Down Sankilian Lane, in Nallur, the mother of art ex-LTTE cadre was 
  killed by electrocution. Mr. Sivanandasundaram and Mr. Rajasangari, prominent 
  Citizen&#146;s Committee leaders, were assassinated during the course of October 
  1988. Many witnesses testify to having seen persons in Indian army uniform in 
  the vicinity of several killings. The objective of these killings seems to have 
  been to create fear among LTTE sympathisers and to cause them to flee. The killings 
  diminished sharply after the conclusion of the Provincial Council elections 
  on 19th November 1988. There is little doubt that the situation will continue 
  to remain fluid.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>The cases documented below are not meant to be exhaustive<sub></sub>but 
  are intended to give some indication of the pattern and the human situation.</span><a href="#_Toc517799942">[Top]</a></p>
