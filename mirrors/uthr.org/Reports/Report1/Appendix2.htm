  1988</a></span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'></span></p>
<p><b>Statement issued by the University Teachers for Human Rights. Colombo, 
  December 1988</b><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:12.0pt;'>.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;'>During the period of six months 
  that we have been in existence, we have issued a number of statements and appeals, 
  both to the Government and to other parties involved in the present conflict, 
  to desist from the use of violence. We now find that the situation has deteriorated 
  to such an extent that a solution seems to be beyond reach. We would like to 
  make one last demand on the right of the peoples of this country to a life free 
  from fear. We also appeal to all organisations and individuals to subscribe 
  to our demand.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;'>We can visualise even a remote chance 
  of a decent existence for the peoples of this country only if we as a people 
  are willing to accept past mistakes and agree to a complete change of heart. 
  Even as human rights organisations, we must admit that, on the whole, we have 
  been very insensitive when large scale violations did take place in the North 
  and East. We have been very passive when the democratic traditions and institutions 
  that were painstakingly built up over half a century were ruthlessly destroyed, 
  especially since 1983. Now, we are equally silent when other organisations which 
  have openly demonstrated their contempt for democratic and human values have 
  taken up the, fight that we failed to lead.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;'>From numerous reports that have 
  been brought to our notice, including specific instances from within the university 
  community itself, we note:</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;'>The continuing violence in the North 
  and the East. The conduct of an election under conditions which most people 
  consider to be unfair has only aggravated the situation and added more parties 
  to a suicidal contest.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;'>The unprecedented carnage in the 
  South. It has been reported that the introduction of the new emergency regulations 
  on the disposal of dead bodies etc. has resulted in widespread and uncontrolled 
  killings of youth.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;'>Even a semblance of normality is 
  found only in and around Colombo. Even here, reported incidents involving even 
  university employees point to the spread of the reign of terror into Colombo 
  itself, where persons are shot and disposed of very casually.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;'>The threats to free public expression 
  of one&#146;s views, extended from all quarters. Political meetings have been 
  attacked and speakers and members of the public have been killed merely for 
  holding opinions opposed to those of the attackers.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;'>Trade union leaders and members 

  have been attacked and killed both for going on strike and for not going on 
  strike.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;'>If we draw any lessons from our 
  unfortunate recent history, it is that: Violence cannot be defeated by violence. 
  Rigged elections and other tampering with the democratic process breeds more 
  and more violence. Hence, as a means of regaining our right to freedom from 
  fear, we demand:</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;'>Immediate dissolution of the parliament 
  and the institution of a multi-party caretaker government.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;'>Immediate withdrawal of the emergency 
  regulations on the disposal of dead bodies.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;'>Confining of troops and all auxiliary 
  forces to barracks and the use of the police force only in law enforcement.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;'>Immediate cessation of all acts 
  of violence by all armed groups, both in the North and the South, against their 
  opponents and members of the public.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;'>We also once again appeal to all 
  other organisations and individuals to join us in our demands.<a href="#_Toc517801677">[Top]</a></span></p>
<h3><a name="_Toc517799971"></a><a name="_Toc517801678"><span lang=EN-GB>Statement 
  Issued by the Federation of University Teachers Associations</span></a><span
lang=EN-GB></span></h3>
<h3><a name="_Toc517799972"></a><a name="_Toc517801679"><span lang=EN-GB>July 
  1988</span></a><span
lang=EN-GB></span></h3>
<p><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;'>We are living through times when 
  this country, once considered safe for democracy, with its newly found notoriety 
  for violation of fundamental rights, seems set to relive the experience of some 
  of the countries in Latin America and the Middle East. Violence appears to have 
  become away of life in Sri Lanka - violence by the state, by political groups 
  and even by individuals. Violence by the latter groups and individuals is a 
  consequence of the violations of democratic norms and indulgence in violent 
  methods by the state itself over the last many years. The Federation of University 
  Teachers Associations is opposed to violence and terrorism whichever quarter 
  it may emanate from.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;'>Since 1979, the Amnesty International 
  has produced lists of hundreds of missing persons who disappeared during the 
  government<sup>&#146;</sup>s security operations in the North and East of this 
  country. The Amnesty International had also detailed gruesome methods of torture 
  compiled from sworn testimonies of the large number of victims. The International 
  Human Rights Alert is another organisation which drew attention to these happenings. 
  Special attention was drawn to the activities of the Special Task Force which 
  is neither directly nor indirectly accountable to parliament. It is with regret 
  that we have to note that serious matters received little consideration in this 
  country.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;'>With a parallel insurgency developing 
  in the South, the same state security apparatus that was used in the North and 
  the East was put to work in the South. In the meantime, Indian forces assumed 
  responsibility for security operations in the North and East. Over the last 
  six months, the number of disappeared persons in the North, the East and the 
  South run into a few hundreds. Several reports of these and extra judicial killings 
  have been well authenticated. There are a number of indications that a number 
  of those detained, including innocent persons, have died as a result of treatment 
  received under interrogation.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;'>The silence of both the Sri Lankan 
  and Indian authorities on the question of disappeared persons has left a number 
  of families in the throes of bitterness and anxiety. They spend day after day 
  going from camp to camp waiting hours on end only to be asked to try elsewhere 
  The matter at present receives far less international publicity because of the 
  common interest of silence on the matter shared by Sri Lankan and Indian Governments.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;'>The disappearance of Wannigama, 
  Assistant Lecturer at Ruhuna University, must be seen in this context. It may 
  be mentioned for the record that in 1983, Assistant Lecturers Nithyanandan and 
  Varatharajaperumal of Jaffna University, who were arrested under the Prevention 
  of Terrorism Act (PTA) came close to death in Welikada Prison. More recently 
  Pulsara Liyanage of Kelaniya University and Dayapala Thiranagairma too were 
  charged under the </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;'>PTA.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;'>As academics, we cannot continue 
  to remain silent on this matter if we are to influence the course of affairs 
  of our country for the good. We acknowledge that the government has a serious 
  problem with the activities</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;'>of the armed rebel groups who are 
  themselves responsible for a large number of killings of unarmed civilians. 
  These groups grew out of past insensitivities to real problems, but we strongly 
  disapprove of the methods of terror being used by the Sri Lankan and Indian 
  governments in combating these problems. Besides the tragic loss of life, the 
  underlying social problems are rendered more chronic. Solution to these problems 
  have to evolve with a will to try democratic alternatives. This requires giving 
  credibility to democratic institutions.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;'>We call upon both the Sri Lankan 
  and Indian governments to put an end to the agonies of relatives by coming clean 
  on disappeared persons, to call a halt to the present repressive methods of 
  operations and to moderate their conduct so that democratic alternatives can 
  evolve. We simultaneously call upon the armed rebel groups to give up violence.<a href="#_Toc517801677">[Top]</a></span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;'>As a response to numerous expressions

  human rights at the University level and in the country in general, the Federation 
  of</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;'>University Teachers Associations 
  (FUTA) decided to sponsor an independent University Teachers Association for 
  the defence of human rights. In pursuance of this goal, University Teachers 
  for Human Rights (UTHR) has been set up.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;'>This organisation seeks to monitor 
  human rights in the country in general, and more specifically in the University. 
  It hopes to collect data relating to human rights violations and raise awareness 
  on the issues. The UTHR would be grateful to you if instances of human rights 
  violations are brought to our attention.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;'>The UTHR will function through its 
  members in different universities. We hope that you would become a member of 
  UTER and enrol your colleagues as well.</span></p>
