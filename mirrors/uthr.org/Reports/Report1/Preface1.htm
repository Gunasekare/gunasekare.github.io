<p class=MsoPlainText><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";'>The 
  University Teacher for Human Rights (UTHR) was formed during the middle of 1988 
  in response to a growing need felt throughout the country. Its membership comprises 
  university teachers from all universities. The need for such an organisation 
  was thrust upon the university teachers in the course of views and problems 
  aired at meetings of the Federation of University Teachers&#146; Associations 
  (FUTA). In time it was decided to form the UTHR as an organisations affiliated 
  to the FUTA, but independent of it. It was natural that several leading figures 
  in the UTHR turned out to be long term activist in the FUTA. It was universally 
  admitted that the role of university teachers in this country in upholding human 
  rights was inadequate, if not unheroic. As much as university teachers in the 
  South could be blamed for their unconcern in the face of the militarisaton of 
  the state (in response to a political problem in the Tamil areas which developed 
  into and insurgency), the university teachers in the north could equally be 
  blamed for their silence on internal developments which culminated in internecine 
  killings. It was recognised by the generality of teachers in the South that 
  the meteoric rise of gross human rights violations in the South was a spill 
  &#150;over from the militarisation of the Sri Lankan state(in response to a 
  problem that should have been dealt with politically), and the resulting debasement 
  of the human psyche (see <a href="Appendix2.htm">Appendix 2 </a>for statement 
  issued by the UTHR)</span></p>
<p class=MsoPlainText><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";'>Violations 
  of human rights in the Tamil areas have a long history going back to the 1970s. 
  The problem simmered for some time and came to the boil after the racial violence 
  o f 1983. Although university teachers in Jaffna had been familiar with organisations 
  campaigning for human rights, left to themselves it is unlikely that they would 
  have gone back into this work at this point of time. The coming together of 
  university teachers in this country and the effect it had on loosening inhibitions, 
  fears and misconceptions was a key even in forming the UTHR, and the UTHR(Jaffna) 
  as an organisation within the UTHR. That the UTHR(Jaffna) derives strength and 
  inspiration from being part of the national organisations gratefully acknowledged.</span></p>
<p class=MsoPlainText><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";'>The 
  enthusiasm shown by the university teachers in Jaffna towards the UTHR was phenomenal 
  once the idea was explained and had caught on. Because of our long experience, 
  questions that are still unresolved in the South were quickly disposed of here 
  in what was a broad consensus. Some of these questions are: Whether we should 
  confine ourselves to persons related to the university or whether we should 
  go into difficulties of the community at large? Whether we should only deal 
  with violations by the state(s)or whether we should deal with violations independently 
  of their source?</span></p>
<p class=MsoPlainText><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";'>It 
  had been generally held by human rights organisations which have been active 
  in this region in the past that it is mainly violations by the state that are 
  significant. The argument given for this stand is that the state represents 
  the internationally acknowledged law-enforcing authority with resources, material 
  and non-material, far exceeding hat of any other group. It is thus the failure 
  by the state to deal with problems justly and wisely that is the principal source 
  of all the resulting violations. This view, which has much merit in it, is reflected 
  in the practice of many international human rights organisations. In many parts 
  of the world with which these organisations were initially concerned, the state 
  exercised a virtual monopoly in the violation of human rights. This was true 
  in Eastern Europe and in parts of the world where there were no armed rebel 
  movements. We have no doubt hat the work done in this part of the world by human 
  rights organisations in the past has brought relief and hope to countless numbers.</span></p>
<p class=MsoPlainText><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";'>In 
  our own context, this approach had some unintended effects. It came to be thought 
  adequate in many quarters to expose the actions of the Sri Lanakan State internationally, 
  while little was done to build our own strength as people who stood by certain 
  ideals and standards. In the course of the resulting passivity, the people lost 
  the will and the ability to check both undemocratic and homicidal tendencies 
  in militant groups which became increasingly hard to ignore. As terror by the 
  Sri Lankan state claimed thousands of lives, people became increasingly passive, 
  finding some relief in the growing military prowess of militant groups and in 
  international campaigns on their behalf. The logic of accepting that the people 
  were helpless was that it came to be thought wrong, if not risky, to criticise 
  any action undertaken by militant groups. In time there were those who advocated 
  human rights campaigns, directed against the state, as part of the militant 
  struggle. In observance of human rights day, speakers stressed national rights- 
  namely the demand for the Tamil separate state of Eelam- saying little or nothing 
  of violations against individuals and groups and the harm done to the community.</span></p>
<p class=MsoPlainText><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";'>The 
  premise that one must not criticise those who had come forward to give there 
  lives in protecting the population against the Sri Lankan state, brought in 
  further confusion when internecine killings resulted in the course of militant 
  groups vying for dominance. Large numbers of our young men who had come forward 
  to give their lives for us had become fugitives in our own community, and were 
  being hunted and killed without knowing why, or what had hit them. Had we nothing 
  to say? The stated premise meant that one must observe silence and pay homage 
  to the victorious group of the moment, now the &#145;sole protector&#148; against 
  the Sri Lankan state. Thankfully, such a premise was not universally accepted, 
  and many unarmed civilians gave refuge to fugitives, placing humanity about 
  ideology. The acceptance of such a premise would also have entailed that one 
  must throw away all universal values and pledge oneself to the power of the 
  moment. Thus, when gun power changed hands and the new victors asked&#148; What 
  were you doing when we were attacked?&#148;, the question, together with the 
  feelings it reflected, had a note of legitimacy.</span></p>
<p class=MsoPlainText><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";'>Again, 
  the more one looks at the problem, one can hardly ignore the fact that the panorama 
  of human misery comprises all shades of people: Tamil, Singhalese, Indian; guerrilla 
  and soldier. Even those who represent states responsible for some detestable 
  acts raise questions which must be listened to with sympathy. Can one shrug 
  way the killings of policemen who were performing a civil functions such as 
  transporting cases between banks, or of soldiers trying to enable passenger 
  trains to run? One cannot but feel some sympathy for a Gurkha or a Sikh soldier 
  who complains that he was told he was coming here to protect the Tamils, and 
  that he has no quarrel with anyone; whereas many people do not seem to lime 
  him, while others are shooting at him.</span></p>
<p class=MsoPlainText><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";'>Daily, 
  young lives are being snuffed out,. The departed person may have been a friend 
  to some, a friend to others and does certainly leave behind a void that cannot 
  be filled. The young life may be that of a civilian, a militant or of a soldier.</span></p>
<p class=MsoPlainText><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";'>We 
  do certainly hold that states, as internationally accountable law enforcing 
  agencies, are principally responsible for an anarchic state of affairs, which 
  devalues life. While we can sympathise with some of heir resentments, we could 
  also ask them to go beyond these. Do their subsequent actions make life pleasanter 
  for themselves or for others? No resentment can excuse a resort to depravity. 
  Behind the impossible tasks faced by the Indian soldier is a history of unprincipled 
  cynicism that governed mutual relations between the Indian and Sri Lankan states 
  and the militant groups. There is also a history of conflicting expectations, 
  which when disappointed led to greater instability. The logic of the Sri Lankan 
  state&#146;s military approach to the Tamil problem was that in the end all 
  Tamils were classed with armed rebels, whose extermination was desired, There 
  is little doubt that, but for international concern, the Sri Lankan government 
  showed few inhibitions against practicing genocide.</span></p>
<p class=MsoPlainText><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";'>We 
  have documented a number of instances where the IPKF has shown a blind preference 
  for a military approach in dealing with day to day problems at the cost of debasing 
  politics. Even if one justifies inhumane practices on pragmatic grounds, the 
  recourse of events suggest a heavy political price and displaced the Sri Lankan 
  forces, the same methods are still being applied with much the same effects.</span></p>
<p class=MsoPlainText><span></span>Our experience has also taught us that the 
  community must develop its ability to stand up for values it hold s dear, which 
  alone can guarantee its dignity. This raises certain matters specific to our 
  own situation, consequent to the marginalizing of all civilian political groups. 
  We have a situation where the gun approach to problems has become the r rule 
  rather than the exception and there is no political impetus to question it. 
  Thus anyone who wishes to question this tendency stands in isolation and cannot 
  identify with any significant political grouping. This is an additional reason 
  why university teachers have been cast into the role of questioning violations 
  by non-state organisations. Perhaps in our context, it is only a human rights 
  group that can question this tendency which has how assumed the proportions 
  of an institution.</p>
<p class=MsoPlainText><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";'>In 
  presenting this report, ewe have avoided emphasis on numbers and have tried 
  to show the human significance of each even. We have presented reports of violations, 
  which came to our attention with out bias. These associated with the university. 
  Accuracy has been ensured, within reasonable limits.</span></p>
<p class=MsoPlainText><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";'>Primarily, 
  we hope that by trying to understand what is happening to this society and to 
  themselves in turn, those responsible for these violations will change their 
  methods and themselves, for the better. In addition, with the world so interlinked, 
  no event is an isolated event. What happens in this so city has a close relation 
  with its interaction with the outside world. By trying to hide what our society 
  really is, we can only deceive ourselves. While exposing what is being done 
  to us, we are also giving and airing to the truth about ourselves. This we hope 
  will challenge us to change for the better.</span><a href="#_Toc517799941">[Top]</a></p>
