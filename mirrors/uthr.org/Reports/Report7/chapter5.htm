<p class=MsoToc3><span
class=MsoHyperlink><a href="#_Toc516626176">5.2 The Army</a></span></p>
<h3>&nbsp; </h3>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>In previous reports we have been trying to point&nbsp; 
  out pat&shy;terns in the conduct of the armed forces. The following adds to 
  what has been said earlier.&nbsp; </p>
<h3 style='text-align:justify'><a
name="_Toc516626175">5.1 The STF:</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
  &nbsp; &nbsp; </h3>
<p class=MsoList style='MsoList '>The STF is a smaller and more closely knit organi&shy;sation&nbsp; 
  compared with other arms of the forces. It is also a good reflection of the&nbsp;political 
  culture articulated from Colombo. Its methods are patronage, targetted&nbsp; 
  terror and deviousness. Unlike with the army, this makes it extremely difficult&nbsp; 
  to judge indivi&shy;dual character among STF officers. Images are carefully&nbsp; 
  culti&shy;vated and used for tactical ends. Some are widely known as decent&nbsp; 
  and understanding. Some tough and brutal. Some play fatherly types who are&nbsp; 
  helpless to prevent what happens.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>In the episode of headless bodies, an impression&nbsp; 
  was deli&shy;berately given that a young officer was responsible. At the time 
  the incidence of headless bodies became frequent in late Septem&shy;ber 1990, 
  the &#8216;good man&#8217; in charge, it became known, had left the station. 
  Comments by officers in the area were devious: &#8220;This chap was caught with 
  a grenade. So and so had taken him. You know what would have happened,&#8221; 
  or &#8220;When we old blood do something we think twice. You know these young 
  chaps. They think only once,&#8221; and so it went on.&nbsp; Later this young 
  officer was transferred out. When people started disappearing&nbsp; around Periyanilawanai, 
  just after the ambushing of 7 STF men in Panama in&nbsp; December, the general 
  talk was that the STF was generally alright, but that&nbsp; this happened because 
  the young officer previously associated with headless&nbsp; bodies was now in 
  charge at Periyanilawanai. This supposition though widely&nbsp; believed was 
  wrong. The young officer was actually in Kalmunai. There were&nbsp; others who 
  thought of this same young officer as decent and helpful.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>What happened at Periyanilawanai had a touch of&nbsp; 
  macabre artistry, very different from the predictable reprisals of the army.&nbsp; 
  The STF did believe in terror as its creed and was bound to respond to the&nbsp; 
  ambush in Panama. What happened appears to have involved some planning. It&nbsp; 
  responded two days later in the nor&shy;thern extreme of the STF&#8217;s area 
  of control for what happened in the southern extreme. The arrival of the nocturnal 
  white van in Periyanilawanai, and the perhaps incidental fact that the OIC was 
  the namesake of the officer commanding the Mankulam army camp when it fell two 
  weeks earlier, gave the incident touches for dramatic speculation. Although 
  more than 25 persons disappeared for unclear reasons, the issue itself became 
  lost. It received no publicity. People who expected reprisals near Panama, once 
  satis&shy;fied that there were none, stopped looking. But for the people in 
  the region who received the news from Periyanilawanai by word of mouth, there 
  was a clear message of menace.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
</p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The incident for many reasons could not have been&nbsp; 
  unknown to the STF high command. The army at Kaluwanchikudy was conscious&nbsp; 
  of it to the point of warning people not to go south. They would have routinely&nbsp; 
  contacted the STF at a higher level to find out what was amiss.&nbsp;<a href="#_Toc516626174">[Top]</a>&nbsp; 
  &nbsp; </p>
<h3><a name="_Toc516626176">5.2 The Army</a></h3>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>It&nbsp; is widely known that among a large class of 
  army officers there is reflected&nbsp; a feeling that they had been ill used 
  by the political establishment, in being asked to fight an &#8216;enemy&#8217; 
  strengthened and fattened with the blessings of the government over 14 months. 
  When the New Year ceasefire was called off by the government on 11<sup>th</sup> 
  January, a widespread wrong impres&shy;sion was created and to some extent promoted 
  after his death, that this resulted from the late Defence Minister&#8217;s personal 
  belligerence.&nbsp; The reasons were more complicated. A large section of the 
  army is known to&nbsp; have expressed the feeling that, if the government can 
  settle the matter politically, fine. But the process of asking them to stop 
  fighting one day and resume the fight with a strengthened enemy another day 
  must stop.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The lack of firm principles and direction in the&nbsp; 
  political establishment, appears to have left many officers disturbed. What 
  is their future, what and whom are they fighting and giving their lives for? 
  Would their actions of today be scorned another day? are questions that would 
  cross any intelligent&nbsp; mind. To the thinking of many officers, the war 
  has already &nbsp;&nbsp; been messed up, and what can be salvaged must be salvaged 
  politically. The mili&shy;tary can best do a holding operation. The ground reality 
  unlike in July 1987, is one where the army controls little in the North&#8209; 
  East. In the East the forces barely control the towns and the main trunk roads. 
  The rest is no man&#8217;s land. Some of these offi&shy;cers are frank in admitting 
  that it is poverty and not patriotism that brings people into the army. These 
  officers would be gene&shy;rally against antagonising civilians unnecessarily 
  and would not risk the lives of their men on doubtful ventures. The knowledge 
  that the battalion which first went into Kalmunai and indulged in widespread 
  massacres, later suffered grievous casualties to the point of wrecking the commander&#8217;s 
  career, has also made an impre&shy;ssion on them.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
  &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Another group of officers tends to believe that&nbsp; 
  the war can be won with more men and material &#8209; a political liability 
  for&nbsp; an economically hard&#8209;pressed government. This group is looked 
  upon by the&nbsp; former as furthering their careers by feeding the vain hopes 
  of politicians&nbsp; who should be seriously looking for a poli&shy;tical solution. 
  This division&nbsp; is influential in determining the company kept by officers 
  within the army.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>It is much to the detriment of the army that the&nbsp; 
  press and the politics prevent the ordinary people from thinking seriously&nbsp; 
  about tragic realities. The games played by the government and the opposition,&nbsp; 
  constantly praising the army without addressing issues, costs the country&nbsp; 
  dearly in lives of civilians and sol&shy;diers. The army has become a sacred&nbsp; 
  animal which is bleeding profusely. Everyone vaunts its sanctity. But the&nbsp; 
  medicine to stop the bleeding is too dangerous to contemplate. For it will&nbsp; 
  raise too many questions about the legacy on which the present politics thrive.
