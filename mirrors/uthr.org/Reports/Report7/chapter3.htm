<h3><a name=a>3.1 </a><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>SAVED BY HIS 
  DOG</span></h3>
<p style='
'> Karuppiah Madhavan (40) from Nawalapitiya had married Sothi­mani of Eravur 
  4, and was the father of Selvi (13), Illankovan (10) and Senthilkumaran (8). 
  The children were living with his mother and were schooling in Nawalapitiya. 
  He had previously worked as a foreman for the Swedish firm Skanska on the Mahaveli 
  project and later at Puttalam. They were barely settled in Eravur for 7 months. 
  He was last working for Daya Stores, Batticaloa.</p>
<p style='
'> On 12th August, the day following the massacre of Muslims in Eravur, the 
  army surrounded his house and dragged out Madhavan with his wife. Both were 
  assaulted. As the army dragged Madhavan to a place 1/4 mile away, he shouted 
  at his wife to run away to safety. The soldiers proceeded to kick him with their 
  boots and assault him with rifle butts. He received injuries on his head and 
  chest and lost some of his teeth. The soldiers inquired about Kuttithamby and 
  Suresh. Madhavan said that he was new here and knew few people. He was losing 
  his senses during the assault as breathing became difficult. Then an officer 
  arrived and Madhavan explained to him in English. The officer asked him to be 
  off or that Muslim thugs would kill him. Madhavan said that he had to go home 
  and look for his wife. The officer followed him as he craw­led home on his knees. 
  Instead of helping him to walk, the sol­diers tried to hold up his tummy. Finding 

  Manonmani missing, he shouted for her. His voice was mostly a gasp. He went 
  over the neighbourhood on all fours calling his wife. The officer warned him 
  again that Muslim thugs would get him. With injuries on the head, teeth broken, 
  a stab on the chest with a small knife, and boot nail injuries all over, including 
  the abdomen, Madhavan went north at crawling pace, followed by his dog Jimmy.</p>
<p style='
'> By sheer force of will, he reached Rameshwaram, which was empty and devastated, 
  at about 2.30 p.m. He was now 3 miles from the Eastern University and physical 
  as well as mental exhaustion caused him to faint. As he regained consciousness, 
  he noticed that he was surrounded by crows and dogs, eager for his exposed flesh. 
  Jimmy was close to him, frantically barking and keeping the predators at bay. 
  Madhavan observed, &quot;Even other creatures became corrupted by mankind, and 
  had developed a taste for human flesh. If not for my faithful Jimmy, I would 
  have been finished.&quot;</p>
<p style='
'> He continued,&quot;I then heard the thundering noise of army trucks from 
  the direction of my home in TC quarters, Eravur. I felt better and slowly walked 
  another mile. I met two persons having a drink of coconut. They had come to 
  look over their houses. On seeing me they offered me a drink of coconut and 
  took me to Eastern University on a bicycle. That was the last time I saw my 
  faithful Jimmy. I reached the university about quarter past six. Two days later 
  my neighbours who were in the camp told me that Manonmani had been seen cut 
  and thrown into a well. They had found her slippers and her rolled up sari. 
  Silly girl. I suspected when I asked her to go away that she would not. She 

  must have waited to see what became of me and Muslim thugs would have got her.&quot;</p>
<p style='
'> Madhavan was hospitalised in Batticaloa for 16 days. He has now aged, is 
  semi&#8209;disabled and wears the scars of his ordeal. He is now in the Batticaloa 
  Hindu College refugee camp and is look­ing for help in starting a small shop. 
  <a href="#Top"><span
style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>[Top]</span></a></p>
<h3><a name=b>3.2 </a>Shot by Home Guards:</h3>
<p style='
'>Mrs. Thangamma Thavarasa of Eravur 4 fled her home with her family to Vantharumoolai 
  (Eastern University) on 12th August, soon after the massacre of Muslims. On 
  30th August she left for home with two other women by a jungle path, to look 
  over their belongings. Having walked two miles, they encountered Muslim home 
  guards who were recently deployed, and began to run away. The home guards followed 
  shooting and asked them to put up their hands. The women were then dragged and 
  abused in filth. They were made to line up and remove their jewels. One home 
  guard then proceeded to shoot the pleading women, reloading his gun each time. 
  Thangamma was shot in the chest below the right shoulder and fainted. Selvam 
  Arokiam survived with a shot in the throat and Pamanasom Esamma died immediately. 
  After recovering con­sciousness Thangamma held her chest wound and walked to 
  Vantharu­moolai with Arokiam. On the way Arokiam collapsed. Hearing dis­tant 
  gunshots Thangamma's daughter Thavendri had come hither to find out. On seeing 
  her mother, she shouted Amma and ran to her. She went back to the university 
  and brought help. Both ladies were taken on bicycles and received first aid 
  at the camp hospi­tal. The ICRC took them to Batticaloa hospital the following 
  day. Arokiam died en route.</p>
<p style='
'> Thangamma was discharged 10 days later and now lives at 7, Pioneer Road, 
  Batticaloa. She faces many problems common to that area. Her son Thavendran 
  (26), was taken by the STF from Eravur on 5th June 1987 and is missing since 
  then. Her daughter Thaven­dri formerly worked for Adam Lebbe at Gaya Bakery, 
  Eravur. Adam Lebbe is himself in difficulties and is unable to help. Her eldest 
  daughter Mrs. Sakthivel had lost her husband and has two boys and a girl (11,10 
  &amp; 9years) to mind. Thangamma had also brought up an orphan, now aged 9, 
  for 6 years. Her skill at rolling cigars is profitable in the villages, but 
  not in town. She now earns a meagre sum selling pieces of chewing tobacco in 
  the market at 50 cents a piece. She thinks that dying would have been easier. 
  <a
href="#Top"><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>[Top]</span></a></p>
<h3><a name=c>3.3 </a>Taken from Eastern University:</h3>
<p style='
'>Thavarani Thambirajah (22) has been through much looking for her brother Uthayakumar 
  (23). They are natives of Kommathurai. On 5th September the army sur­rounded 
  the Eastern University. Thavarani saw her brother for the last time when the 
  boys were separated from the girls. Uthaya­kumar was one of the 159 taken away 
  after being pointed out by informers. Uthayakumar first worked as church keeper 
  at the Chenkaladi Methodist Church, then at the dispensary of Dr. Ragu­nathan 
  of Eravur and later with the Director at the Methodist Educational Centre, Chenkaladi. 
  He was known to many leading persons who would vouch for his character. His 
  misfortune may have been that he was known in Eravur.</p>
<p style='
'> The family went to the Roman Catholic Bishop. The Catholic Club circulated 
  appeals to army camps. They went to the Morakka­tanchenai army camp in early 
  February this year and were given a date to call again. The mother went on 10th 
  February and spoke to an official through a TELO interpreter. She was told that 
  the army had not been able to check yet, and promised to give her further information 
  by post. Nothing was heard. They lodged an appeal with the ICRC on 14th March. 
  Among the children there is one other boy and 5 girls. <a
href="#Top"><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>[Top]</span></a></p>
<h3><a name=d>3.4 </a>Hide and Seek in Batticaloa Prison:</h3>
<p style='
'>During the third week of January this year the army did a round up at Santhiveli 
  and Kaluwankerny and altogether 10 priso­ners were taken. They were sent to 
  Batticaloa prison and were beaten on the way. All were subsequently released, 
  two on 1st February and the rest, later. Many of the prisoners were middle aged 
  (35 &#8209; 45 years) and had 3 &#8209; 6 children. Before their release they 
  had some novel experiences. This was a period during which greater leniencey 
  was exercised. It is not representative of what took place earlier or what may 
  come after.</p>
<p style='
'> The prisoners were often kept awake by screams in the night. Many of the 
  torturers were said to be Muslim deserters from the LTTE. Sometimes they were 
  driven in a van with tyres and petrol cans and their eyes tied, after threats 
  to burn them, and then brought back after a 5 minute drive.</p>
<p style='
'> The ICRC used to come once a week and they used to be shown only a section 
  of the prisoners. When the ICRC spoke to them individually, prisoners were usually 
  afraid to speak of those not shown. Once when the ICRC arrived, 13 prisoners 
  were quickly hustled away by the guards and only 8 shown. When the ICRC spoke 
  to them they made a routine denial that there were other priso­ners. But one 
  boy signalled with his fingers. The ICRC visitors also apparently noticed that 
  there were more shirts hanging than there were people. The ICRC left. The 13 
  were brought back by the guards. The ICRC officials then suddenly returned and 
  took down details of the 13 they had not seen earlier. The prison officials 
  were angry about the ICRC's discovery. They suspected one priso­ner who knew 
  English and had with the permission of the guards, helped the ICRC to fill up 
  forms about other prisoners. After the ICRC left, this prisoner was assaulted. 
</p>
<p style='
'> The prison facilities, it is said, were not bad. They were given good food, 
  including noodles. <a href="#Top"><span style='text-decoration:none;
text-underline:none'>[Top]</span></a></p>
<h3>3.5 Left for Dead in Kallar:</h3>
<p style='
'>A young man holding a very responsible job in the East left Kalmunai on 21st 
  June 1990 when army reprisals were at its peak, and proceeded northwards with 
  his younger brother. At Kallar they were stopped by the army, and the younger 
  brother was asked to proceed with some of the others. The young man was then 
  merci­lessly assaulted and was left for dead against a fence. After the army 
  left, the owner of the house came to look, and saw a move­ment of the young 
  man's hand. His people were contacted in due course and he was warded in Kalmunai 
  hospital.</p>
<p style='
'> Subsequently, he was taken twice by the police and released after being 
  assaulted. His identity card was also taken. He now has a dent at the back of 
  his head, two fingers broken by the police and hurriedly set in the local hospital,
