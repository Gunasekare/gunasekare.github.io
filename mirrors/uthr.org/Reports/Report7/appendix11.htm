        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>AN&nbsp; APPEAL&nbsp; BY&nbsp; THE&nbsp; 
        COUNCIL&nbsp; OF&nbsp; HINDU&nbsp; ORGANISATIONS<br>
        </b></div>
      <b> </b><br>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; A statement issued by the Council of Hindu Organisations and 

      signed by its president Yogendra Doraiswamy and its secretary S.P. Nadarajah 
      was published in the Island of 11th April 1991. In prefatory comments it 
      stated :<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp; "On June 11th 1990 renewed fighting suddenly erupted between the 
      Government&nbsp; of Sri Lanka and the L.T.T.E. in the North-East province. 
      No public statement&nbsp; was issued, either by the Government or the L.T.T.E., 
      as to the issues discussed&nbsp; and the points of disagreement during the 
      fifteen months of warm and cordial&nbsp; relationship that preceded the 
      renewed conflict. <br>
      <br>
      Nine months have passed and there is no indication of a cessation of hostilities. 
      Destruction of persons and property is taking place on a large scale. Though 
      the Government had announced at the outset that this war was not against 
      the Tamils but only against the L.T.T.E. every month innocent civilians 
      are dying by the score and a large number of public buildings and private 
      houses are being destroyed. Refugees numbering one million are eking out 
      an existence in very poor living conditions.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp; Normal life is at a standstill and people are suffering great hardships 
      and untold misery. The North-East province is turning into a waste land, 
      a scorched earth and many people are leaving the area in desperation".<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp; Proposals: The following proposals were then put forward after arguing 
      that&nbsp; present troubles are largely a result of the failure to implement 
      the Indo-Lanka&nbsp; Accord.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp; "As advocates of a united Sri Lanka, where every citizen should enjoy 

      freedom,&nbsp; equality and justice, we wish to suggest a package of proposals 
      to alleviate&nbsp; the situation in the North-East province and restore 
      peace and normalcy. The Government of Sri Lanka:&#64979;<br>
      <br>
      1) to announce an immediate cessation of hostilities. the L.T.T.E. to respond 
      positively.<br>
      <br>
      2) to ensure that sufficient supplies of food, fuel and medicines are sent 
      regularly to the International Committee of the Red Cross, who in co&#64979;ordination 
      with the Government Agent, will distribute them.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; 3) to announce that it would fully implement without delay 
      the Indo-Sri&nbsp; Lanka Agreement of July 29th 1987.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
      &nbsp; 4) to nominate an Interim Council for the North-East province in 
      Consultation&nbsp; with the parties who were elected to the North&#64979;East 
      Provincial Council. The&nbsp; Interim Council should proportionately comprise 
      representatives of parties&nbsp; elected at the Provincial Council elections. 
      The L.T.T.E. should be invited&nbsp; to join. Subjects assigned to the Interim 
      Council should also include law&nbsp; and order, education, health, land 
      development, relief and rehabilitation&nbsp; of refugees. The Interim Council 
      should function till the Provincial Council&nbsp; comes into being after 
      a free and fair election.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp; 5) to initiative negotiations with the L.T.T.E. after the cessation 
      of hostilities&nbsp; takes effect. This should lead to laying down of arms 
      and reciprocal measures&nbsp; by the Government. A practical approach is 
      necessary in this regard. The Government of Sri Lanka is the other party 
      to this conflict and cannot expect to supervise or monitor the cessation 
      of hostilities and the laying down of arms. A neutral force is, therefore, 
      necessary for this purpose. An Indian Peace Keeping Force could be invited 
      for this operation as India guaranteed the Indo&#64979;Sri Lanka Agreement 
      of July 29th 1987. If India is unable to send a Peace Keeping Force, then 
      a friendly country like Canada, Australia, Sweden or Norway could be approached. 
      Arms should be laid down by all militant groups, home guards and private 
      militias. Simultaneosly, the Sri Lankan Government should close down all 
      security forces camps established since 1977 and the security forces in 
      the remaining camps should be confined to their barracks. This applies to 
      the North-East province. It was with the 1977 General Elections that the 
      fight for Eelam started and the T.U.L.F.&nbsp; was returned in large numbers 
      on this ticket. The Government took counter measures by opening new camps 
      and sending large contingents of security forces to the North. The status 
      quo ante should be restored as at 1977.<br>
      <br>
      The Police should maintain law and order as in normal times and early action 
      should be taken to hold Provincial Council elections. Opportunity should 
      be given to the Provincial Government and the Council to function without 
      let or hindrance. The Peace Keeping Force should remain till the Provincial 
      Government had been in office for a period of three years.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp; Any issue like the question of linkage of the former Northern and 
      Eastern&nbsp; provinces, may be raised after the Provincial Government had 
      been in office&nbsp; for three years. Such questions could be settled by 
      negotiations between the Centre and the North-East Provincial Government. 
      Time will play a role in viewing the problem in its correct perspective."<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; The appeal concluded by requesting the government and the 
      LTTE to come up with the necessary courage and statesmanship to overcome 
      mutual suspicion and distrust created by long years of bitter conflict. 
      It added :<br>
      <br>
      "We have made these proposals in the firm conviction that their implementation 
      would not only restore peace, human rights and democratic institutions, 
      but also would set in motion a process which would create mutual trust and 
      understanding between the two peoples".<br>

            </div>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<i><b> About mid-night on 20th January 
            (0000 hrs 21st), some vehicles &nbsp; approached Talaimannar village. 
            Subsequently there were knocks on several &nbsp; house doors. Those 
            who opened the doors were blinded by torches flashed by&nbsp; the 
            intruders. After looking over the inmates, certain persons pointed 
            out&nbsp; were taken. The others were threatened to remain silent, 
            and the intruders &nbsp; left. In all, nine persons, including one 
            woman, were taken. After dawn,&nbsp; the villagers went to the army 
            camp at Talaimannar Pier, 1 1/2 miles away.&nbsp; The army denied 
            any knowledge of the incident. <br>
            <br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The officer-in-charge of the camp was 
            known by his nickname &nbsp; Chamakkoli (Mid-night Cock) because of 
            his habit of being active at mid&#64979;night. &nbsp; Previously in 
            late December, the entire village had been ordered to assemble &nbsp; 
            at the local church at mid-night. No one was then taken. The Brigadier 
            then &nbsp; in charge of Mannar made no bones about his inclinations. 
            During his public &nbsp; relations exercises he used to boast about 
            knowing how to deal with terrorists, &nbsp; and how he had presided 
            over the killing of 3000 terrorists where he had&nbsp; been posted 
            in the deep South, during recent JVP troubles. NGO's were warned&nbsp; 
            to be careful and that he had seen from a helicopter, their vehicles 
            being&nbsp; used by terrorists. Given the sensitive nature of Mannar 
            as a prospective&nbsp; refugee settlement, following the disappearances, 
            concerted pressure from&nbsp; NGOs resulted in the Brigadier's transfer&nbsp; 
            to Trincomalee.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Officer-in-Charge at Talaimannar Pier 
            was also transferred. &nbsp; The new OIC visited the village and gave 
            an assurance that such unfortunate &nbsp; things will not happen again, 
            and wanted the villagers to report if anything &nbsp; happened. The 
            new Brigadier gave similar assurances to the public and promised &nbsp; 
            the families that he would inquire into the fates of those taken.<br>
