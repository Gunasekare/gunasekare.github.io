<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The material in this chapter was drafted in close consulta&shy;tion 
  with a Human Rights Group the Movement for the Defence of Democratic Rights 
  (MDDR), based in the South, that is in close touch with&nbsp; the areas concerned. 
  The reports on the LTTE massacres of Sinhalese civilians&nbsp; in Athimale and 
  Niedella were presented by activists who visited the villages&nbsp; immediately 
  after the attacks.&nbsp;<a href="#t">[Top]</a> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
<h3><a name="_Toc516626529">7.1&nbsp; The Borderlands</a>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
  &nbsp; &nbsp; </h3>
<p class=MsoList>The following sketch gives an impressionis&shy;tic&nbsp; picture 
  which it is hoped would clarify current issues. We mentioned in <a
href="../../SpecialReports/spreport3.htm">&nbsp; Special Report No.3</a> the existence 
  in the East of what was known in Survey&nbsp; Department parlance as Park Countries. 
  These were fertile lands once cultivated&nbsp; and abandoned to the advance 
  of the jungle, because of war or other calamities,&nbsp; perhaps a millenium 
  ago. That was a time when people had no notion of modern&nbsp; ethnicity and 
  it would be absurd to term them Sinhalese or Tamil. There have&nbsp; also been 
  other communities present on the South Eastern seaboard such as&nbsp; those 
  who were descendents of seafarers presumably from the East Indies (Malaya,Sumatra, 
  Java), whose culture and religion&nbsp; (animism) were unique. &nbsp; &nbsp; 
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
<p class=MsoListContinue>There are also Gypsies (Kuravar) speaking&nbsp; Telugu, 
  who are now Roman Catholic Christians. (See <a href="../../SpecialReports/spreport3.htm">&nbsp; 
  Special Report No.3</a>).&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
<p class=MsoListContinue>The East came under the Kandyan Kingdom which was neither 
  Sinhalese nor Tamil in the modern sense. Although the Amparai&nbsp; District 
  was largely depopulated in recent times, the state of affairs in&nbsp; some 
  of its purana (ancient) villages give a hint of their history. Among&nbsp; these 
  villages are Uhana, Komariya, Bandara&shy;duwa, Dhamana, Thottama, Padugoda, 
  Gonagolla and Inginiyagala. Barely 40 years ago,people living in these villages 
  were equally fluent in Sinhalese &nbsp;&nbsp; and Tamil, and several of them 
  sported Tamil names like Selladurai and Sellamma. If not for the aggressive 
  interposition of Sinhalese nationalism, this state of affairs would have continued 
  and any change would have been healthy.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
<p class=MsoListContinue>To the West of Amparai District lies the&nbsp; Moneragala 
  Dis&shy;trict, once the rich province of the Kandyan Kingdom known&nbsp; as 
  Velassa. These rice growing peasants took part in the rebellion against&nbsp; 
  the newly imposed British crown in 1818. In quelling the rebellion, the British&nbsp; 
  largely depopulated the area. The recolo&shy;nisation of this area began under 
  D.S.Senanayake in the early 50<span class=msoins0><span class=msoIns><ins cite="mailto:Unknown%20User"
datetime="2001-02-25T16:28"> &nbsp; &#8217;</ins></span></span>s. Colonists were 
  brought in from hill country villages&nbsp; such as Welimada and Nuwara Eliya. 
  The induction of colonists did not threaten&nbsp; the old residents as there 
  was land. The latter rather prospered as traders&nbsp; and had a labour force 
  at their disposal. They thus became the local elite.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
  &nbsp; </p>
<p class=MsoListContinue>Further North, near Kalmunai, the Central&nbsp; Camp 
  colonies were established about 1952 to 54. Colonies 3,16,18,19 and 22 were 
  largely settled by Sinhalese from the Kegalle District.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
  &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
<p class=MsoListContinue>Further North, the Trincomalee District&nbsp; was also 
  characte&shy;rised by a history of human diversity. Although the&nbsp; Sinhalese 
  population in recent times was very small, there had been survi&shy;ving&nbsp; 
  Sinhalese villages, often closer to the Tamils in culture (e.g. women&#8217;s 
  dress, water pots made of a copper alloy etc) Their&nbsp; folk memory traces 
  their origin back to Velassa in 1818. Further back in history, the building 
  of Kantalai tank is attributed to Agrabodhi, King of Anuradhapura. The tank 
  fell into disuse with the decline of Anuradhapura &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; about 
  a millenium ago. In recent times Kantalai was a Tamil&nbsp; speaking village 
  until colonisation began around 1952. Tamils, Muslims and&nbsp; Sinhalese were 
  given land. In recent times the drive for Sinhalisation through&nbsp; administra&shy;tive 
  means has been more overt.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
<p class=MsoListContinue>Violence against Tamils in Amparai during&nbsp; 1958 
  was largely by the employees of the Gal Oya Board rather than by colonists. 
  &nbsp; Starting from modest positions, several of these employees became rich 
  businessmen.&nbsp; With the commencement of the war of June 1990 the expulsion 
  of Tamils from&nbsp; the Gal Oya Board areas neared completion.&nbsp; <a href="#t">[Top]</a>&nbsp; 
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
<h3><a name="_Toc516626530">7.2.Massacre of Sinhalese&nbsp; in Athimala, Moneragala 
  District</a>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </h3>
<p class=MsoList2 style='MsoList2 '>At&shy;himale&nbsp; is a village in Velassa 
  5 miles west of the Amparai Dis&shy;trict boundary,&nbsp; adjoining Pottuvil. 
  Following massed attacks in Mannar and Karainagar, the&nbsp; LTTE had by indications 
  banked on a ceasefire by the Sinhalese &#8209; Tamil New&nbsp; Year &#8209; 
  13<sup>th</sup> April. The government forces had signalled their lack&nbsp; 
  of interest in a ceasefire, which they suspected to be disadvantageous for&nbsp; 
  them, by resuming limited bombing in Jaffna, and firing shells from Palaly,&nbsp; 
  killing two women in Colombogam, about the time of festi&shy;vities. That&nbsp; 
  Tigers would attack Sinhalese civilians had also been widely anticipated by 
  the government. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Until the terror bombings of 1986, attacks on&nbsp; 
  Sinhalese civilians had been rationalised by regarding colonists in the Tamil&nbsp; 
  provinces as a paramilitary arm of the government. The attack on Athimale&nbsp; 
  and on other parts of Moneragala lacked even this justification. They were&nbsp; 
  simply easy targets.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Athimale is a reasonably well to do farming&nbsp; village 
  with about 350 persons. It had a police post commanded by a Sargeant,&nbsp; 
  with 12 men. For a few days before the incident villagers had observed &nbsp; 
  armed men dressed in shorts and jungle green shirts in the&nbsp; vicinity. This 
  was conveyed to the police. The police took little notice,&nbsp; evidently because 
  false alarms were a regular phenomenon. On the evening of the 14<sup>th</sup> 
  April, shortly before the incident, a young man reportedly&nbsp; told the police 
  about the pre&shy;sence of intruders. A skeptical policeman&nbsp; gave him a 
  whack and sent him off. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>About 5.30 p.m. a party of armed persons approached&nbsp; 
  the village along a track leading to it from the jungle. The first persons&nbsp; 
  they accosted were two young men on bicycles proceeding to look over their&nbsp; 
  rice fields. they were stopped and hacked to death. There was no alarm since&nbsp; 
  guns were not fired. Further down the track the armed prowlers encountered&nbsp; 
  Jayasundera (60), father of 7, a respected farmer and village elder and also 
  a reputed snake&#8209;bite physician. He too was similarly done away with. A 
  man&nbsp; tying his cow met with the same fate. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
  &nbsp; </p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>By the time the attackers, said to be about 20 in number, 
  reached the village, it was nightfall. They ignored the first few huts which 
  were quiet and walked into the 5<sup>th</sup> where two neighbou&shy;ring&nbsp; 
  families had got together for the festive evening meal. There were two husbands,&nbsp; 
  their wives and five children in all. The two men were ordered to face the&nbsp; 
  wall and an attacker swung a sword at them. One man after receiving an injury,&nbsp; 
  sprang out of the hut before the second blow came. He ran towards the police&nbsp; 
  station. Alarmed by his screaming, others in the village started running in 
  panic. The attackers then proceeded to cut the remai&shy;ning man, mothers&nbsp; 
  and children, in the hut. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>A man from another hut had started running, leading 
  away his expectant wife and 3 children, the eldest of whom was a boy of 7. This 
  family was accosted by a group of 5 armed men who killed them all.&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The first hut was set on fire with the dead and the 
  dying inside. A girl of 5 with a piece of her ear cut and cut injuries&nbsp; 
  on her body, crept out of the burning hut and lay down under a papaw tree.&nbsp; 
  Subsequently, she crept further away. In the morning other villagers spotting&nbsp; 
  caked blood under the papaw tree, found this girl unconscious, having turned&nbsp; 
  blue during the cold night. She is now warded in hospital, an orphan.&nbsp; 
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Having finished their hacking of humans, the&nbsp; 
  attackers raided a chicken coop, and their choppers got to work again. the&nbsp; 
  headless chicks were taken away in sacks in addition to cooking material such 
  as onions. The attackers withdrew, evidently in no hurry, placing at least 3 
  Johnny mines at the bends at locations with a high probability of someone stepping 
  on them.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The injured man who went to the police, got there by 
  8 p.m. grabbed a gun and threatened to go himself. The police told him that 
  they could not go just like that and appealed for help from Siyambalanduwe&nbsp; 
  and Arugam Bay. A police party from the former and an STF party from the latter 
  reached Athimale police station by midnight. They set off at 4 a.m. when a Buffel 
  armoured car arrived. It was considered too risky without the armoured car because 
  of the mines. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>In the morning Piyadasa, the local co&#8209;op manager&nbsp; 
  lost his leg after stepping on a mine while walking with the police. The&nbsp; 
  search drew a blank. Later in the day a mine clearing operation was done in 
  the area. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>It has been customary for some time now for persons 
  in isolated villages in the area to move into the jungle for the night.&nbsp; 
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>No one doubts that the attackers were the LTTE,&nbsp; 
  having free movement in the jungle belt from Kanjikudichcharu. The mines used 
  were of the kind normally used by them. After such massacres, the LTTE is usually 
  silent, neither accepting nor denying. But its propaganda machinery&nbsp; overseas 
  would argue, using discrepancies in the reporting that the government&nbsp; 
  or someone else was responsi&shy;ble. Any self&#8209;respecting liberation group&nbsp; 
  would not merely deny being responsible for such atrocities, but would express&nbsp; 
  horror on principle and show by its general conduct that its behaviour is&nbsp; 
  far superior to the forces opposed to it.&nbsp;<a href="#t">[Top]</a> &nbsp;

</h3>
<p class=MsoList style='MsoList '>In Rajaela (King&#8217;<span class=msoIns><ins>s</ins></span> 
  Canal), Colony 94, in the Kantalai scheme, people&nbsp; were out on the streets 
  late into the night to observe New Year festivities.&nbsp; But underneath the 
  convi&shy;viality, there was an air of foreboding. Kantalai&nbsp; lies on the 
  Habarana&#8209;Trincomalee road. At each dawn, route clearing patrols&nbsp; 
  march along the road between Kantalai and Habarana. Some of them are ambushed.&nbsp; 
  It is only after 8 a.m. that the road is opened to traffic. By common consent&nbsp; 
  it is accepted that being on the road outside town after 4 p.m. is dangerous.&nbsp; 
  On normal days the town is nearly empty by 4 p.m.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
  &nbsp; </p>
<p class=MsoListContinue>According to village leaders, they will not be attacked 
  in the immediate future as there are still settlements on either side of them. 
  Many of these settlers work in cane fields. But one day, they are sure, when 
  the adjoining settlements have been attacked and dispersed, their turn would 
  come. They are skeptical about the ability of the forces to defeat the LTTE. 
  They think the LTTE would survive, and one day the Sinhalese would be pushed 
  down to Habarana.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
<p class=MsoListContinue>In support of their skepticism, a villager&nbsp; spoke 
  about his having been in the police station when a radio message from&nbsp; 
  a police vehicle, attacked out of town, was received. The police left the&nbsp; 
  station after 20 minutes. By then the attackers had fled leaving behind two&nbsp; 
  dead policemen.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
<p class=MsoList2>The settlements were formed about 1952/53 and now&nbsp; the 
  third generation of Sinhalese are living there, with ties to the land&nbsp; 
  which they developed for a livelihood. After some discussion, several of them 
  agreed that the Tamils had a problem. But the government had brought them there 
  having told them there was land, and moreover, were not after all Tamils living 
  in Sinhalese areas? they had never been warned that there would be trouble of 
  this kind. Although they see little hope in the future, they think it is the 
  reponsibility of the government to salvage the mess.&nbsp;<a href="#t">[Top]</a>&nbsp;

  &nbsp; &nbsp; </h3>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Pushparani (26) a final year Dental student at the 
  University of Peradeniya was to sit for her final examinations. A native of 
  Karaitivu, she left on the 3.30 p.m. bus from Kalmunai, which started late at 
  5.00 p.m. The bus stopped at the STF check point at the 17<sup>th</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp; 
  mile post past Amparai town and all the passengers were asked to get down.&nbsp; 
  After being checked, the passengers got inside the bus. They were asked to&nbsp; 
  get down again on the pretext that there was a bomb inside. This time Pushparani&nbsp; 
  was given a lot of attention. She was questioned closely about her personal&nbsp; 
  details. After a delay of about an hour, the passen&shy;gers were asked to&nbsp; 
  get inside and be seated. The bus was then sent off.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
  &nbsp; </p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Barely two miles away, about 9.30 p.m. the bus&nbsp; 
  was stopped by armed men. The men got into the bus and made straight for Pushparani 
  who was seated near the rear, and dragged her out. The driver was ordered to 
  proceed. The bus then stopped at Siyambalanduwe and a complaint was made to 
  the police.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

<h3><a name="_Toc516626533">7.5 Massacre at Niedella, Moneragala District:</a>&nbsp; 
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </h3>
<p class=MsoList style='MsoList '>20<sup>th</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp; April. Ru&shy;mours 
  of an LTTE presence had been about for some time. Nimali&nbsp; Rajapakse (21) 
  a pre&#8209;school teacher was at home about 7 p.m, when her younger&nbsp; sister 
  Malkanthi came running, asking others to hide. Just then they heard&nbsp; gunshots 
  from across the field. From their experience during the JVP troubles,&nbsp; 
  they recognised the firing of an automatic. Once more, after a long interval,&nbsp; 
  they took off to hide in the bushes with some of their close relatives, until&nbsp; 
  it was past dawn. The attackers had come from the direction of the river.&nbsp; 
  The occupants of the first house, P.R. Gunapala, his wife and two children&nbsp; 
  (5 &amp; 3) escaped by climbing a tamarind tree. In the next house 75 yards&nbsp; 
  away, two children Thakshila (5) and her brother Ratnayake (2 <span class=msoins0><span class=msoIns><ins
cite="mailto:Unknown%20User" datetime="2001-02-25T16:28">&nbsp; &frac12;</ins></span></span>) 
  were beheaded. Their father escaped, but the mother&nbsp; is warded in Badulla 
  hospital with a neck injury. Those in the following house escaped by hiding 
  inside the well.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
<p class=MsoListContinue>From the house across the stream from Nimali&#8217;s 
  they first heard hammering on the walls followed by&nbsp; the screams of a mother, 
  <span class=msoins0>&#8220;<span
class=msoIns><ins cite="mailto:Unknown%20User" datetime="2001-02-25T16:28"> </ins></span></span>Oh! 
  my children, Oh! my children<span class=msoins0>&#8221;</span>. Then silence. 
  It was disco&shy;vered later that the&nbsp; mother and three children, Radhika 
  Priyantha (6), Dhanushka Sampath (4) and&nbsp; Surangi (2 <span class=msoins0><span
class=msoIns><ins cite="mailto:Unknown%20User" datetime="2001-02-25T16:28">&nbsp; 
  &frac12;</ins></span></span>) had been killed.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
<p class=MsoListContinue>M.M.Dharmasena (30), a farmer, thinking that the noises 
  he heard were firecrakers, went out to investigate about 7.30 p.m. Hearing a 
  gunshot from the neighbouring gem merchant<span class=msoins0><span class=msoIns><ins cite="mailto:Unknown%20User"
datetime="2001-02-25T16:28"> &nbsp; &#8217;</ins></span></span>s house, he ran 
  back home. His wife, who had already&nbsp; hidden with her children inside bushes, 
  called softly to him. They lay hidden&nbsp; until dawn. The horn of the car 
  next door was sounded for about 20 minutes,&nbsp; which alerted many.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p class=MsoListContinue>Dharmasena&#8217;s brother escaped while his wife and 
  two children had&nbsp; been beheaded. His brother went back to the scene and 
  let out a loud cry.&nbsp; He ran into the jungles when someone shined a torch. 
  The wife<u>&#8217;</u>s gold chain was taken, while the children&#8217;s earrings 
  had been removed by tearing the ears.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
<p class=MsoListContinue>W.M. Premasiri (25), cultivator, had a similar&nbsp; 
  experience. He lay hidden with a group of 30. He first took the firing to&nbsp; 
  have come from the army. When it was quiet, his brother Jayatil&shy;leke went 
  home to investigate, when he was chased by two women. He escaped into the jungle 
  losing his clothes on the way. About 12.30 a.m. three vehicles, which they took 
  to be army vehicles, sounded their horns. No one risked leaving&nbsp; their 
  hiding places. The vehicles went away. The attackers were said to be&nbsp; dressed 
  in military type uniforms.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
<p class=MsoListContinue>In the morning Premasiri found 6 shiny empty&nbsp; shells 
  and a katty (traditional knife, used for lopping branches). Nine per&shy;sons,&nbsp; 
  including 3 women and 5 children, who were gathered in a house for a ceremony&nbsp; 
  had been killed by cutting blows aimed at the back of their necks. An ear&nbsp; 
  on one side was also cut. The attackers had removed chillies, flour and torch&nbsp; 
  batteries. Anan&shy;da, who was hidden with A.M. Punchibanda (30), his wife&nbsp; 
  and 4 children, went towards his house on a Land Master tractor to check on 
  his family. He was shot dead on the way.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
<p class=MsoListContinue>The attackers also killed Kuruwita Mudalali,&nbsp; at 
  whose house they had stopped to drink tea.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
</p>
<p class=MsoListContinue>The 22 human victims were buried in a mass&nbsp; grave 
  at 3 p.m. the following day in coffins brought by the STF. Included&nbsp; among 
  the victims were two new born calves that were beheaded. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
  &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
<p class=MsoListContinue>Prior to the burial, 15 soldiers had come&nbsp; in two 
  trucks. Some officers in a jeep were driving up and down. About 2 p.m. a red 
  car arrived with its horn blaring. Then the car left followed by the military 
  party. The frightened villagers were left to cremate the dead with whatever 
  flammable material they could gather.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
<p class=MsoListContinue><u>Who was behind the massacre?</u>: In 7.2 we referred 
  to the confusion and panic prevailing in the area. When the villagers were probed 
  about details such as times and juxtapositions, there was confusion. Persons 
  in the village claim that some of the attackers spoke fluent Sinhalese. The 
  gem merchant had been individually summoned, it is said, by an attacker who 
  spoke good Sinhalese. The attackers had come in two or three groups, some of 
  whom it appears, were women. Nimali Rajapakse, for instance, who says she heard 
  one of the attackers say in Sinhalese, There is no one in this house,<span class=msoins0><span
class=msoIns><ins cite="mailto:Unknown%20User" datetime="2001-02-25T16:28"> </ins></span></span>maintains 
  that some of the attackers must have known&nbsp; the village. This is also the 
  opinion of Dharmasena, who adds that even villagers&nbsp; sometimes lose their 
  way in the area.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
<p class=MsoListContinue>The attackers appear to have been around&nbsp; until 
  3 a.m. at least. This time, the army and police had come shortly after&nbsp; 
  the police at Okkampitiya were alerted &#8209; just after mid&#8209;night. But 
  there was no confrontation. The attackers had looted food sup&shy;plies needed 
  for jungle survival. amongst the incongruous things they did, in one house they 
  took the women&#8217;s and children&#8217;<span
class=msoins0><span class=msoIns><ins cite="mailto:Unknown%20User"
datetime="2001-02-25T16:28">;</ins></span></span>s clothes, but left the men<span
class=msoins0>&#8217;<span class=msoIns><ins cite="mailto:Unknown%20User"
datetime="2001-02-25T16:28">;</ins></span></span>s clothes strewn about.&nbsp; 
  &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
<p class=MsoListContinue>One indication that the Tigers were involved&nbsp; was 
  their standard signing off by strewing Johnny Battas (soap sized mines&nbsp; 
  that blow off the foot that treads one &#8209; a Tiger invention). Several of 
  them&nbsp; were discovered in the mine clearing operation, including two in 
  Nimali<span class=msoins0>&#8217;</span>s garden. The person who went to the 
  Okkampitiya police&nbsp; and returned with 4 policemen at mid&#8209;night, had 
  stepped on a Johnny mine and is now in Badulla hospital with an amputated foot. 
  This manis a full time SLFP worker who offered to walk ahead of the&nbsp; policemen 
  as the latter were afraid. This is of significance in view of allegations&nbsp; 
  hinted at by the government, suggesting that the SLFP was playing a sinis&shy;ter&nbsp; 
  role and creating a scare.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
<p class=MsoListContinue>Though the people strongly suspect the Tigers,&nbsp; 
  there is also much confusion. One story in the village holds that a JVP killer&nbsp; 
  from the village had told the police upon arrest, that there is a combined&nbsp; 
  party of 250 JVP and LTTE in the jungle. The villagers are themselves cynical&nbsp; 
  about everyone. When the JVP insurgency was on, the village was suspect. Some 
  of the shot guns in the village were taken away by the JVP. The police then 
  retrieved the balance.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
<p class=MsoListContinue><u>The aftermath</u>: Panic was rife in the Moneragala 
  district after the massacre. As it was, many villagers were spending their nights 
  in the jungles. As soon as the news reached Okkampitiya the following morning, 
  the shops closed instantly. A Tamil boy raised by Sinhalese who had said that 
  he had seen someone running off into the jungle, was taken away by the STF, 
  despite pleading by his Sinhalese family.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
</p>
<p class=MsoListContinue>At Buttala, at 4 p.m. (21<sup>st</sup> ),&nbsp; a crowd 
  of 5000 gathered at the police station in search of protection. Two&nbsp; Tamils 
  travelling in a bus were pulled out and assaulted. Unconfirmed reports&nbsp; 
  said that Tamil workers at the Pelwatte Sugar Factory had been attacked.&nbsp; 
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
<p class=MsoListContinue>The Island of 25<sup>th</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp; April, said, 
  quoting a police spokes&shy;man, that two Tamil tea estate&nbsp; workers were 
  killed by a mob at Badalkumbara on the 22<sup> nd</sup> night,&nbsp; and that 
  line rooms occupied by Tamil labourers were burnt at Badalkumbara&nbsp; and 
  neighbouring Ram&shy;bukkana. It added: &#8220;Unconfirmed reports indicated&nbsp; 
  that an undis&shy;closed number of Tamil workers had been seriously injured...&nbsp; 
  A large number of Tamils living in the area had sought police protection fearing 
  further attacks, the officials said. The report further said that no further 
  incidents were reported after Monday night and that the police&nbsp; were intensely 
  patrolling the area. A military spokesman in Colombo was quoted&nbsp; as confirming 
  the communal unrest, but adding that the police had the situation&nbsp; under 
  control.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
<p class=MsoListContinue>For the villagers in Niyadella itself there&nbsp; was 
  no assurance of any further protection beyond the promise of shotguns&nbsp; 
  from the Chief Minister of Uva. In terms of its present military and political 
  &nbsp; framework, the government had no answer. In a further twist to the developing 
  &nbsp; tragedy, the Hill Country Tamils of Indian origin, appear to be getting 
  dragged&nbsp; into this mess invo&shy;luntarily. Dinesh Watawana, writing in 
  the Sunday Times of 28<sup>th</sup> April, quotes a defence official in Colombo 
  as saying that: About 30 suspected LTTE terrorists were believed to&nbsp; be 
  mingling with estate labourers disguising themselves as estate workers.&nbsp; 
  The killers believed to be in groups of twos and threes are said to be hiding&nbsp; 
  in different estates. With their weapons hidden in nearby jungles, the terrorists&nbsp; 
  have, on several occasions, assem&shy;bled together with weapons to attack&nbsp; 
  Sinhala villages<span class=msoins0><span class=msoIns><ins cite="mailto:Unknown%20User"
datetime="2001-02-25T16:28">.</ins></span></span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
</p>
<p class=MsoListContinue>The recent attacks on civilians were not in operational&nbsp; 
  areas. This shows that a group of terrorists have infiltrated into Sinhala&nbsp; 
  areas to create havoc,a military official said.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
</p>
<p class=MsoListContinue>A senior STF official in the area was more&nbsp; forthright 
  when he told a very responsible person that they did not believe&nbsp; that 
  the attack was conducted by the LTTE. &nbsp; &nbsp; He suspected that the attackers 
  were estate Tamils.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
<p class=MsoListContinue>The STF&#8217;s reasons for saying that are understandable. 
  They have&nbsp; more or less maintained that areas under their control have 
  been cleared of the LTTE. If otherwise, their peculiar methods and professional 
  competence&nbsp; will be put into question. The recent attacks on estate Tamils 
  in the area&nbsp; must raise the disturbing question of what kind of security 
  they would enjoy&nbsp; in the light of such suspicions becoming common currency.&nbsp; 
  &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
<p class=MsoListContinue>We know from past experience and the progress&nbsp; of 
  the current war, that the methods of the government forces can only result&nbsp; 
  in hopeless deterioration, adding to alienation and intensification.&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
<p class=MsoListContinue><b><span
style='font-family:Arial'>Further&nbsp; Reports of Attacks on Estate Tamils:</span></b> 
  At 11.00 p.m. on 24<sup>th</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp; April, 12 attackers entered an 
  estate owned by the Edna group in Kumbukkanna,&nbsp; in the Parawilawatte division, 
  and set fire to 14 line rooms built by workers&nbsp; themselves, and a further 
  4 constructed by Edna group. 32 workers were injured.&nbsp; The estate is 6 
  miles from Okkampitiya.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
<p class=MsoListContinue>1500 up country Tamils live in an estate&nbsp; in Srigalawatte 
  formerly owned by the Upali group and presently under Janavasa. &nbsp; Since 
  there is no work on the estate, the community depends on 150 workers&nbsp; who 
  travel to Moneragala town to do a variety of menial work, as seasonal&nbsp; 
  workers. 100 of them were attacked and had to spend 3 days in the jungle without 
  food before trekking back home. The community is now without means. &nbsp; &nbsp; 
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
<p class=MsoListContinue>100 seasonal workers used to go from Koslanda&nbsp; estate 
  to work in sugar can fields owned by the Pelwatte Sugar Company. These&nbsp; 
  workers were beaten and had to shelter in the jungle.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
</p>
<p class=MsoListContinue>A south based human rights group which visited&nbsp; 
  these up country Tamils with the aim of providing relief, was unable to confirm&nbsp; 
  reports of killings. The Ceylon Workers Congress visited the Edna group estate&nbsp; 
  in Kumbukkana.<a href="#t">[Top]</a></p>
