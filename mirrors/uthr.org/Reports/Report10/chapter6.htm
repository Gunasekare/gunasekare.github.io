<h3><a name="_Toc515974707"><span style='font-weight:
normal'>6.1 The war begins<span style='color:#990000'>:</span></span></a> </h3>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;On 10th June 1990, the day the Batticaloa 
  police station was surrounded by the LTTE, the situation in Trincomalee was 
  confused. The Buddhist monk from Uppuveli went to&nbsp; Trinco town and inquired 
  from some Christian clergy whether there would be trouble in the district. He 
  was told that according to the LTTE, they had no intention of starting anything.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;On the 11th Uppuveli police station was surrounded 
  by the LTTE and both the police station and the CTB depot were attacked. After 
  some firing, the police surrendered. A number of policemen were killed by the 
  LTTE. According to local sources, 11 bodies of policemen were dug up from a 
  nearby pit by a police party several days later. Orders were then given to all 
  LTTE cadre in town to abandon their sentry points and withdraw into the jungle. 
  Confusion reigned in town that night as the people found themselves in no-mans 
  land between the security forces still afraid to leave their camps or slowly 
  edging forward, and their protectors-in-name who had suddenly vanished. Uppuveli 
  was shelled that night by the navy and the army from Fort Frederick and Orr's 
  Hill. About 35000 people, mostly Tamils, left Trinco town by night and set off 
  on foot northwards to Nilaveli, where the LTTE had apparently indicated that 
  they would be safe. The Muslims largely remained in town, while the Sinhalese 
  sought safer places.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;A shell fired reportedly from the army camp 
  at Orr's Hill struck a rice mill at Nilaveli killing up to 45 refugees - Tamils 
  and Muslims - sheltering there. The number of policemen killed by the LTTE in 
  the Trincomalee and Mutur areas is placed at around 100.</span> <span style='color:#990000'><a href="#_Toc515974661">[Top]</a></span></p>
<h3><a name="_Toc515974708">6.2 The army enters Trinco town</a> </h3>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;On 13th June 199O, troops under the command 
  of Colonel Saliya Kulatunge (Sinha Regiment) entered Trincomalee town from Fort 
  Frederick. This was followed by soldiers in civil indulging in widespread looting 
  and burning. The husband of a school principal went with a senior citizen on 
  a motor cycle to look for a close relative, one among a number of persons arrested. 
  They were first stopped by a party under a lieutenant and then again in front 
  of the urban council building. They got by, mentioning the name of a senior 
  army officer known to them. What this showed was that the looting and burning 
  were very much under the supervision of the forces.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;During the 4th week of June the Trincomalee 
  residents were asked to assemble at the stadium, leaving one person at home. 
  The residents were paraded before masked informants in the presence of Colonel 
  Saliya Kulatunga and other senior citizens who were allowed to observe the proceedings 
  from a distance. About 5OO suspects were taken away for interrogation under 
  a unit headed by Colonel Kotegoda. A Tamil speaking interrogating officer, Corporal 
  Ismail, was brought from Colombo. Many of those taken for interrogation were 
  subsequently released. But what proportion is not clear. Several like Balthaazer, 
  a burgher, and Sylvester were released through personal interventions. Among 
  the suspects taken were 7 girls from Mutur, then in Trincomalee. The matter 
  was taken up by a women's organisation in Trincomalee, including others. One 
  of the girls, a student about to enter university, was released that night with 
  her jewellery missing. A senior citizen, over the next few days, gained access 
  to a captain through an interrogation officer, Corporal Srilal from Negombo, 
  who had earlier served in Trinco. After promising to release the remaining girls, 
  another 4 were released at the former VIP's hotel. One girl released was the 
  sister of a woman police constable.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Three weeks after the arrest, the two girls 
  not released were painstakingly traced to the army camp in Thambalakamam. When 
  the matter was reported to Colonel Saliya Kulatunge, he got the Thambalakamam 
  camp on the phone and let loose in unprintable language. He then assured the 
  citizens that the girls would be released in one week's time. The hidden implication 
  was that they were not in a state to be released. Following the release of the 
  girls, a lady medical officer in Trincomalee was prepared to examine them. The 
  frightened girls refused. Their captors had warned them that they had been marked 
  for elimination and had been saved in the nick of time.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Among those arrested and beaten were several 
  employees of the CTB and of the Port Cargo Corporation.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The foregoing complements accounts in <a
href="../Report4/Report4.htm">Reports 4</a> &amp;<a href="Report5\content5.htm"> 
  </a><a
href="../Report5/Report5.htm">5</a>. The killings by the forces during the actual 
  takeover of Trinco town do not appear to have been as numerous as in the Amparai 
  and Batticaloa Districts. One witness (<a
href="../Report4/Report4.htm">Reports 4</a> ) saw about 4O bodies in an area near 
  the hospital. Several of the killings were more isolated and are difficult to 
  quantify. Many of the Tamil refugees in the area were housed in the aircraft 
  hanger at Clappenburg.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>Chelvanayakapuram was bombed prior to the army 
  moving in on&nbsp; the 3rd day. Once the army moved in, people were asked to 
  return. K.Velupillai, a retired principal, was taken to the army camp. When 
  the wife went looking for him, she was told that she could see the husband's 
  ashes.</span> <span style='color:#990000'><a href="#_Toc515974661">[Top]</a></span></p>
<h3><a name="_Toc515974709">6.3 Killings at Monkey Bridge, Palampottaru</a> </h3>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;During the months following the outbreak 
  of war, several civilians were reportedly stopped and knifed to death at the 
  Monkey Bridge army camp. One case is that of a young man who lived with his 
  mother at Green Road, Trincomalee. His brother had worked for the late TULF 
  leader and Leader of the Opposition, Mr. A. Amirthalingam. The young man did 
  well buying Elf vehicles, repairing and selling them, and was fluent in all 
  three languages.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;While driving to Colombo the young man was 
  stopped by soldiers at Monkey Bridge. Friends travelling from Colombo to Trincomalee 
  saw him at the army camp in a poor state with blood on his face. When they spoke 
  to the soldiers, they said that they would release him.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;When the friends reached Trincomalee, they 
  contacted leading citizens. These persons in turn made representations through 
  Major Induruwa and through Ananadarajah, DIG of Police. There was no response. 
  The young man had a child and his wife was then expecting the second. His car 
  however continued to be seen at the Monkey Bridge camp for several more days.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Later on Major Rockwood assumed command at 
  Monkey Bridge. Thereafter the soldiers were disciplined and there were no further 
  incidents of the kind above reported at Monkey Bridge.</span> <br>

  &nbsp; </p>
<h3><a name="_Toc515974710">6.4 Ratnam Master, Nilaveli</a> </h3>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Following the outbreak of war there were 
  3 refugee camps in Nilaveli Methodist Church (8th mile post), Roman Catholic 
  Church (9th mile post) and the Mosque (1Oth mile post). The last, housing Muslims 
  and Tamils, was run by the government. Most of the time it was the first two 
  refugee camps that were subject to frequent round ups. On the first occasion 
  2O were taken from the Roman&nbsp; Catholic Camp and several of them were not 
  released. 14 were taken from the Methodist camp and all of them were released.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Ratnam Master was a 6O years old retired 
  teacher who spent the day at home and went to the Methodist church for the night. 
  On the day of the round up mentioned, home guards working with the army came 
  to his house and demanded cattle. On being refused they threatened him and went 
  away.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The same evening there was a second round 
  up of the Methodist camp by the army and home guards. Nine, including Ratnam 
  Master, were taken away. Seven, including Kennedy, but excluding Ratnam Master 
  were later released. Later inquiries at the Nilaveli army camp elicited the 
  response that he may be in another army camp.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The rest of the story, which shifted to Plantain 
  Point Camp in Trincomalee, did not come out until long afterwards. Ratnam Master 
  was taken to Plantain Point Camp where a band of old rubber was wound around 
  an arm and set on fire. He was kept with others with one hand of each chained 
  together. Together with their chains the prisoners were marched to bathe in 
  the sea, while the movement of all civilian traffic on the adjacent road was 
  stopped. Left in this manner without medical attention, Ratnam Master's wound 
  became septic. Others who were chained to him then complained that the smell 
  was unbearable. Two young prisoners were then given detol to clean the wound. 
  They found that the wound had reached a stage where the bone was showing. In 
  the sequel, Ratnam Master, smelly and feeble, was detached from his companions 
  and placed on the verandah for the night. Untended and unprotected, Ratnam Master 
  breathed his last in the cold hours of the night. The last resting place of 
  the venerable old schoolmaster was a giant pit in the compound of the army camp, 
  where he, like many others, was turned to cinders.</span> <br>

<h3><a name="_Toc515974711">6.5 Plantain Point Camp, Trincomalee</a> </h3>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Like many parts of the East, Mutur was an 
  area where the powers that be had used the simmering tensions between Muslims 
  and Tamils to their advantage. In 1985 when the government was using these tensions, 
  Tamil houses were burnt. During the IPKF presence Tamils attacked Muslims. When 
  the LTTE was in charge before the war, the Muslims were again antagonised.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Following the outbreak of war, many prisoners 
  from other parts of Trincomalee were brought to Plantain Point Camp. Hundreds 
  were reportedly killed and burnt [<a
href="../Report5/chapter2.htm">Chapter 2</a>, <a
href="../Report5/chapter2.htm">Report No.5</a>]. Among the materials used for 
  burning bodies was cadjan sent by relief agencies to house refugees.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Shortly after 1Oth June 199O, Tamil families 
  fearing the worst, left the elderly in their homes and went into the jungles. 
  The army established itself at Mutur under Lieutenant Nanayakkara (Officer in 
  Charge) and Lieutenant Bandara (killed later that year). The families then returned 
  leaving the young males behind in the jungles. They were asked by the army to 
  call their young men, promising that no harm would befall them. When they returned 
  at the end of July they were beaten by the army, who also invited Muslim thugs 
  from the bazaar to beat them. Sixty of them, including S.Suthahar, and the Dhoby's 
  son Babu, were taken to Plantain Point Camp.</span> </p>
<p><b><span style='color:#990000'>6.5.1</span></b><span
style='color:#990000'> Festivities at Plantain Point: There was a standard routine 
  when prisoners were brought to Plantain Point Camp. For soldiers bored with 
  torture, it was a festive occasion. There would be wild howling, and soldiers 
  would assemble with a variety of gadgets to swing at prisoners. Babu, who was 
  hit on the head with a hammer, went insane and later succumbed. In the meantime 
  Babu's father went to the ICRC. But his name was not found in the lists at detention 
  camps. Babu had been arrested in early May 1987 by Sergeant Piyadasa and Homeguard 
  Salim, and then released after the matter was reported to (now Brigadier) Srilal 
  Weerasooriya.</span> </p>
<p><b><span style='color:#990000'>6.5.2</span></b><span
style='color:#990000'> Suthahar and hostage patrols: On three occasions Suthahar 
  was taken by soldiers, petrol was poured into tyres, and he was threatened with 
  the fate associated with these symbols. All three times he closed his eyes and 
  said, &quot;Jesus, Jesus, Jesus&quot;. There was another practice in vogue at 
  Plantain Point. Young prisoners were dressed in army uniform, given unloaded 
  guns, and made to walk at the head of foot patrols. About 5 to 1O miles out, 
  when Suthahar was ahead in a patrol, a soldier behind struck an anti-personnel 
  mine, loosing a foot. Suthahar then heard the other soldiers asking for the 
  `Demala Ekkenek'(Tamil fellow). Suthahar quickly hid among the bushes. After 
  some time the patrol returned to camp. Meanwhile other representations had been 
  made and Colonel Tennekoon, in charge at Plantain Point, was asked about Suthahar 
  by higher authorities. The colonel then reportedly ordered that no harm should 
  be done to Suthahar. When the patrol returned, they were asked about Suthahar. 
  Others were then set to fetch him. Suthahar was released.</span> </p>

style='color:#990000'> Dr. (Mrs) Saverimuttu was an Ayurvedic doctor serving in 
  the Kinniya area. Following the outbreak of war, she moved in with Muslim friends 
  in Vellai Manal. Later she was arrested and taken to Plantain Point. Fellow 
  prisoners once heard a Muslim Homeguard telling her, &quot;Akka (elder sister), 
  there are orders to kill you&quot;. Since then they never saw her.</span> <span style='color:#990000'><a href="#_Toc515974661">[Top]</a></span></p>
<p><b><span style='font-size:13.5pt'><a name="a"></a>6.6 Trincomalee:&quot;Normality&quot; 
  Restored</span><span style='color:#990000'>!</span></b> <br>
  <span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Shortly after the outbreak of war, Lucky Wijeratne 
  replaced Srilal Weerasooriya as brigadier in charge of the region. As the weeks 
  wore on the usual Operation Jackal followed the first body blow of the military 
  takeover. This consisted of nocturnal predators going in white vans and such 
  like abducting people, many of whom subsequently disappeared. The operation 
  which was headed in Batticaloa by Captain Munas was headed in Trincomalee by 
  a Captain Suresh Cassim working with homeguards.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Many Trincomalee citizens spoke of Brigadier 
  Wijeratne as a `good&nbsp; officer' in Sri Lankan terms. He was described as 
  a professional soldier who was readily approachable by citizens and would face 
  an awkward issue rather than put it off. He well knew, and at least accepted, 
  what was happening under his command. On occasions he had acted on representations 
  and released persons taken. One citizen said, &quot;When it came to operations 
  he stuck to his own way of doing things. If he was ordered to take a place, 
  he had his methods. There was no listening to representations about how the 
  people may suffer or be cut off without food. But once in control soldiers would 
  go and offer food, or tell people, `What a pity some terrorists have burnt your 
  roof. We will give you the materials for repair'.&quot;</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Lucky Wijeratne and Richard Wijesekera, SP, 
  were killed in a landmine explosion in the spring of 1991. Chandra Perera who 
  succeeded as SP did much to raise the reputation of his office. As a person, 
  he is well-regarded by the public without reservation.</span> <span style='color:#990000'><a href="#_Toc515974661">[Top]</a></span></p>
