<h3>&nbsp; </h3>
<h3><a name="_Toc515973203">1.1 Failure of democracy and the culture of repression</a> 
</h3>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;On 10th December 1992, Human Rights Day, 
  demonstrators led by some opposition parliamentarians on a peaceful march in 
  Slave Island raising the issue of tens of thousands disappeared over the years 
  were set upon by the police. The demonstrators were tear gassed&nbsp; attacked 
  with batons and even journalists covering the event were subject to assault. 
  The police were also assisted by persons not in uniform. The following day accounts 
  of the incident were given in parliament by Vasudeva Nanayakkara and Mahinda 
  Rajapakse, the MPs concerned. There was laughter from the government benches 
  when the first described the treatment by the police of the latter.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;So soon had recent history been forgotten.When 
  Tamil MPs in the late 70s and early 80s described the behaviour of the forces 
  in the North -East, there used to be sneering jubilation from government benches. 
  The events inexorably led to the three year closure of the universities in the 
  South, the arrival of the IPKF and the JVP uprising. The government members 
  were then anything but jubilant. MPs were among the 40 thousand or so killed. 
  Several of the once all - powerful top brass in the services tried everything 
  from medical leave to resignation.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The events of 10th December were not isolated. 
  A few months ago Yunoos, cartoonist for the much respected Aththa, journal of 
  the Communist Party, was stabbed, leading to protests by journalists.On 10th 
  October, the lady mayor of Nuwara Eliya and several of her body guards took 
  strong arm measures to block the sales of two newspapers, the Ravaya and the 
  Yukthiya. This led to protest meetins in the town organised by journalists affiliated 
  to the Free Media Movement and the use of the Police in attempts to deter them.</span> 
  <br>
  <span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The unhealthy drift in the political culture 
  was also reflected in an event in the University of Colombo involving <b>Dr. 
  Nalin de Silva</b> of the the Department of Mathematics and prominently of the 
  Jathika Chinthanaya Movement. Dr. de Silva adopted an insensitively communal 
  position on the ethnic question. This position maintained at best that the ethnic 
  problem did not exist or at worst that it was an Indian ploy, notwithstanding 
  years of bloody civil strife. The Doctor's affairs of immediate concern to the 
  university were however his reportedly controversial relations with his colleagues 
  and students. It was generally alleged that his brash attitude to colleagues 
  and the conduct of students influenced by him were disruptive to the functioning 
  of the university. On 4th December the university council issued a suspension 
  order against him and even before the suspension was explained, followed it 
  up the next day with an interdiction order. The university was at this time 
  closed due to disruption. It became evident as the days followed that the matter 
  was not so simple. Dr.de Silva had been repeatedly elected to responsible positions 
  in staff unions. Currently he is president of the Federation of University Teachers' 
  Associations (FUTA) and also of the University&nbsp; Science Teachers' Association.</span> 
  <br>
  <span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The problem was thus that though 
  many of Dr. de Silva's colleagues disapproved of his actions, the matter was 
  referred to higher authorities because there was no functioning structure, such 
  as a healthy union, that could discuss the matter and take up positions. This 
  would have been the right way to constrain aberrant conduct among colleagues. 
  On the part of the authorities, they left themselves open to accusations of 
  high-handedness by acting against Dr. de Silva without first calling for his 
  explanation. Several of Dr. de Silva's colleagues feel that his conduct has 
  been both insulting and intimidating. The kind of political ideology articulated 
  by Dr. de Silva inevitably leads to conduct that is insensitive and oppressive. 
  Those like him may arouse sympathy by rightly pointing out the shortcomings 
  of the system. But their ultimate role is not of reform, but to exacerbate these 
  shortcomings and profit by them. It is amidst this broad failure of sound traditions&nbsp; 
  that there is a resort to levers of power that prudence demands should, if at 
  all, be touched sparingly and with caution. Thus the unhappy trend in our universities 
  continues. Instead of training the intellect and character of students, they 
  too are being trained, like their peers, to think and act like army brigadiers.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;There is also a general concern that any 
  charges framed against Dr. de Silva would of necessity have to be so vague and 
  general as to create a precedent for more thoroughgoing victimisation of those 
  not liked by the authorities. Expressing his concern about the whole procedure 
  while dissociating from Dr. de. Silva's views, Osmund Jayaratne, trade unionist 
  and professor emeritus ended his letter to the Island' with a line from Shakespere's 
  Hamlet': `There appears to be something wrong in the state of Denmark'.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;In the end there is little happening to challenge 
  the tragedies of the last decade. Once again the summoning of brute force is 
  being advanced as a panacea for the inconveniences of those with authority. 
  That recent history has shown it to be a fast wasting asset, has been forgotten.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;This line evidently has a wider application 
  when one looks at the state of the political culture within which the more pressing 
  question of the civil war is being addressed.</span> <a href="#_Toc515973201">[Top]</a></p>
<h3><a name="_Toc515973204">1.2 Crucial differences</a> </h3>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;There are many reasons why history cannot 
  once again flow along the same channels. In the early 8Os the power and arrogance 
  of the state were largely unchallenged. The July 1983 violence, the civil war, 
  the arrival of the IPKF, the JVP episode, the government's discredited relations 
  with the LTTE, a series of dubious election results, the humiliation of state 
  forces and the much publicised attempt to impeach the president leading to arm 
  twisting within the ruling party, have all helped to erode the authority and 
  image&nbsp; of the state. A positive feature of the Southern polity, as opposed 
  to the Northern polity, is that enough pluralism has survived in the South to 
  make this current crisis good for democracy. There is a more visible attempt 
  to assert the freedom of the press, and brave attacks upon it. The Yukthiya 
  has published the reflections of a soldier questioning the military policy of 
  15 years directed against the Tamils. But the overwhelming majority of leaks 
  from the army receiving press publicity deal not with the Tamil question, but 
  with the helpless anger within the army directed at the political establishment 
  and the government in particular.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Whether the present opportunity for democracy 
  will be used with success depends on whether or not the ideology of Sinhalese 
  chauvinism will be challenged and laid to rest. Only thus can the Tamil counterpart 
  of this ideology be denied legitimacy, laying the foundation for a united Sri 
  Lanka. An earlier opportunity did arise when the IPKF arrived in 1987, but was 
  mislaid, plunging the country into a&nbsp; blood-bath. Although the present 
  government for its own survival may see a need to challenge Sinhalese chauvinism, 
  it is too weak to offer an initiative. The task thus falls primarily on NGOs 
  and other organisations with an interest in democracy.</span> <a href="#_Toc515973201">[Top]</a></p>
<h3><a name="_Toc515973205">1.3 The armed forces and the nemesis of lawlessness</a> 
</h3>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;In a deviation from the headlines that one 
  gets used to,`the Christian Worker' of November 1992 carried the singular caption: 
  Justice for Voters and Generals?. The articles inside dealt with the Election 
  Commissioner Chandrananda de Silva's report published earlier in the year, the 
  famous clandestine disclosures of Udugampola, former DIG of Police, and the 
  deaths of ten leading service men, including General Kobbekaduwa, in a landmine 
  blast on the eve of a major military operation last August. The election commissioner 
  in his report earlier this year pointed by implication to considerable malpractice 
  during the February 1989 parliamentary elections while the police looked on. 
  In another of his disclosures made in April from hiding, former DIG Udugampola 
  added that terrorism prevailing at that time was a necessary cover for the UNP's 
  (government party's) machinery of fraud to operate without impediment. Among 
  the methods alleged by the DIG was the deployment of `Black Cats' supplied by 
  UNP MPs to kill opposition (mainly SLFP) activists. The DIG said that he had 
  6O names of persons so killed.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The end result of all this was a heightened 
  sense of insecurity and cynicism in the South. People were ready to believe 
  the meanest allegations made against the state. Conspiracy theories which began 
  with the mysterious crash of Upali Wijewardene's jet in 1982 reached a crescendo 
  with General Kobbekaduwa's death. Defence Minister Ranjan Wijeratne's death 
  in a car bomb explosion last year had given rise to a bout of speculation given 
  subsequent revelations of intimate contacts between top UNPers and a deported 
  Singaporean financier and gambling magnate. Wijeratne had acted against the 
  latter on the findings of his brainchild, the Bureau of Special Operations headed 
  by Udugampola.The BSO wound up in January 1992. About the time of Kobbekaduwa's 
  death the country had been abuzz with bizarre stories of magic rituals for the 
  protection of VIPs, soothsayers and disappearing virgins-the last hotly denied 
  by irate senior policemen.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;With the killing of the 1O leading servicemen 
  in a mine explosion in Kayts the dam burst. The one man commission comprising 
  Justice Ismail appointed by the government to quell rumours, failed to stem 
  the tide of press speculation fuelled by leaks from the forces. What the investigation 
  proved with near certainty was that the Tigers could not have done it. The explosion 
  occurred on a disused jeep track adjacent to the cleared main track in use. 
  With all the imponderables of the officers' arrival and movements, if the Tigers 
  were to spend time planting a mine in a relatively open space in the proximity 
  of two army posts, they would have hardly chosen that spot. This left the most 
  reasonable explanation that the mine was an old one planted before the army 
  took that area, as maintained by army spokesmen. The alternative explanation 
  of an inside job was almost unthinkable in a country that had singularly failed 
  to keep even one secret. Nevertheless the tide of speculation persisted. The 
  report of a former British army expert based on an examination of photographs 
  of the scene taken by colleagues of the officers led the late general's wife 
  to ask the president for an international inquiry which was promptly acceded 
  to.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The subsequent killing of Admiral Clancy 
  Fernando in Colombo by a suicide bomber was relatively uncontroversial as the 
  cause was patent. The LTTE did not help matters when it claimed responsibility 
  for the killing of the 1O officers which it could hardly have done and kept 
  quiet on the Clancy Fernando affair. A desperate government media eager to quash 
  speculation publicised the LTTE admission of the first together with photographs 
  of an award ceremony graced by the leader for cadres alleged to have planted 
  the bomb. The people in Jaffna were aware that the LTTE made the claim only 
  after the government media broadcast the event in August. The common strand 
  in the speculation both in the North as well as the South dealt with the near 
  certainty of secret collusion between leaderships of the warring adversaries.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;For many army officers and men it was a time 
  of creeping doubts as to why, what and for whom they were giving their lives. 
  The top brass were in public dispute about objectives. Among the men desertion 
  increased sharply.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Speaking in parliament on 19th Novemeber, 
  Lakshman Jayakody (SLFP) gave the human cost of the war since July 1983 as follows: 
  30 000 civilians of all communities dead, inclusive of militants. 8000 made 
  limbless, 600 000 made refugees. A further 200 000 displaced persons living 
  with friends and relatives, 170 000 in India and another 200 000 outside South 
  Asia Defence expenditure stood at an annual US $500 million.(See 6.1 for some 
  different estimates given by Dr. Nithyananthan of the University of Jaffna). 
  For the forces: 5500 service and police personnel killed since July 1983, 7700 
  desertions - nearly 1300 since August.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;By thus demeaning law and humanity, the government 
  and the forces became authors of their own paralysis. The heartfelt tributes 
  paid to the dead are of comfort to those once near to them who are left behind 
  in the face of uncertainties. But the reputations of men who may have accomplished 
  much good in happier circumstances will of necessity remain sullied by the institutions 
  they served. Questions over their own deaths were not dissimilar to those which 
  arose over the fates of their victims, in a country lacking in points of moral 
  reference.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Addressing a routine multi-party conference 
  a few months before he died, Ranjan Wijeratne told a Tamil group in answer to&nbsp; 
  a question about Tamil detainees: &quot;We are not interested in whether they 
  are guilty or innocent. If you say they are your cadre, we will release them.&quot; 
  Other appeals made subsequently over persons taken by the forces from refugee 
  camps and who then disappeared fell on deaf ears. During Operation Liberation 
  in May 1987 civilian detainees viewed by then Brigadier Kobbekaduwa at Nelliady 
  junction were a little later taken down Pt Pedro Rd, asked to run and shot at 
  from&nbsp; behind. Despite the islands off Jaffna being taken by forces under 
  General Kobbekaduwa in August 199O with next to no resistance by the LTTE, more 
  than 7O civilians were killed at close range. Several of them were killed by 
  the forces after being made to perform forced labour. The late general may have 
  been enlightened by the standards of the normal run of military men in this 
  country. It is by no means obvious that troops under his command were more humane 
  than others. The nation has failed these men in leaving grave doubts hanging 
  over their memories.</span><a href="#_Toc515973201">[Top]</a> </p>
<h3><a name="_Toc515973206">1.4 Reporting and National Unity: Operations in the 
  North</a> </h3>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The war on the government side, it is said, 
  is being fought to&nbsp; unite the country. But the attitudes to the lives and 
  dangers faced by people whose reconciliation within the national fold is being 
  sought remains curious. Regular reports dealing with the North are of the kind 
  below:</span> <br>
  <span style='color:#990000'>Island, 12.11.92: JOC said yesterday that, &quot;the 
  Navy observed a flotilla of about 10-15 boats approaching the Naval Sub Unit 
  at Nagathevanthurai (in Jaffna Lagoon) and opened fire. Terrorists on board 
  returned the fire and having altered course fled the area. It is believed terrorists 
  on board suffered casualties, but details are not available at present.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>Daily News, 30.11.92:&quot;Security forces have 
  destroyed 25 boats at a Sea Tiger base in outer Mathagal, while the navy has 
  destroyed around 5O LTTE craft in the Jaffna lagoon during the last month. In 
  addition air force bombers are attacking LTTE targets in several areas of the 
  North.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>Island, 9.12.92: &quot;The navy opened fire and 
  destroyed three speeding boats in the Jaffna Lagoon according to northern military 
  sources. The sources said the boats were being used by the LTTE to transport 
  fuel and other supplies. The navy recovered the wreckage of a boat and a few 
  barrels of fuel.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>Island, 27.12.92: &quot;Sri Lankan air force planes 
  bombed Tamil guerilla positions in the northern rebel stronghold of Jaffna, 
  military sources said today.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&quot;We took some targets-known terrorist camps- 
  on Wednesday&quot;, a senior officer in charge of operations in the North said.&quot;But 
  we had no details of the bomb damage or casualties yet.&quot;</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>Other reports of this kind mention the navy firing 
  on `terrorist' boats in the lagoon killing terrorists and recovering supplies 
  such as bicycles, food and fuel without bothering to tell us whether the persons 
  shot&nbsp; at were armed or had fired at the navy. The following nearly humorous 
  piece appeared in the Daily News of 2nd December 1992:</span> <br>
  <span style='color:#990000'>Navy seizes Tiger boats, smugglers leap into lagoon</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>The Shri Lanka Navy's inshore patrol craft, operating 
  in the Jaffna lagoon, seized two LTTE boats in the early hours of Monday. The 
  occupants jumped overboard and are presumed dead.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>The encounter was on the southern side of the lagoon, 
  east of Nagathevanturai, at 3.55 am. The captured boats, equipped with two outboard 
  motors, were said to have been carrying 5O gunny bags of rice and sugar and 
  42 bicycle frames smuggled from the mainland to the Jaffna peninsula.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&quot;It looks as if Tiger mobility is now limited 
  on the peninsula. They would otherwise not need bicycle frames. Maybe the other 
  items needed to assemble complete bicycles have already been taken across, or 
  have still to get across,&quot; a senior military officer said yesterday.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>He said that on the previous night at 9.15 pm, 
  the navy had sunk yet another terrorist craft in the same area and all those 
  aboard it were believed drowned.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&quot;May be cycle trimmings were in that boat?&quot; 
  the officer speculated. The navy was being very vigilant in this particular 
  area, after these incidents, he said.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>The Colombo, English press did however give us 
  some glimpses of what was really going on:</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>Daily News 19.12.92 quoting Reuter: &quot;....Military 
  authorities declared the lagoon patrolled by the navy and covered by radar, 
  a &quot;no-go&quot; zone and warned that anyone crossing the water could be 
  shot on sight.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&quot;Despite the ban about 2000 people, mostly 
  Tamils, crossed the lagoon daily because all other routes were sealed by the 
  army and the rebels refuse to allow traffic on the main road to the peninsula.....</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&quot;The bodies of two people, apparently civilians, 
  were washed ashore on the mainland side last week, the residents said, adding 
  that they thought the victims died when their boat was attacked by the navy.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&quot;At least 10 rebels were killed when navy 
  patrols destroyed two of their dinghies trying to cross the lagoon under cover 
  of darkness earlier in the week, military sources said on Thursday.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&quot;Sometimes the civilian boats are escorted 
  by the guerillas who also on occasion transport civilians on faster boats for 
  a higher fee...&quot;</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>The Island, 28.10.92: &quot;The TULF alleged yesterday 
  that more then 10 men, women and children had been killed in a quarry in Vellaveli 
  in Batticaloa. A statement issued by the TULF executive committee also said 
  that the frequency and intensity of attacks by the armed forces against unarmed 
  civilians in the North and East had increased during the last two weeks. &quot;There 
  had been aimless bombings in Udupiddy, Valvettithurai and Kokkuvil,&quot; it 
  added.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;There had been persistent independent reports 
  of civilian bodies being washed ashore in the Jaffna lagoon. The Virakesari 
  reported those of a mother and daughter holding hands last October, and that 
  of a child in November. On the bombing operation referred to above, independent 
  sources confirmed that air force jets bombed Nunavil, Chavakacheri on 26th November, 
  killing three siblings - a girl and two boys.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>A feature in the Sunday Times of 18th October 1992 
  by its Defence Correspondent which carried a feature on sea operations and included 
  an interview with the late Vice Admiral Clancy Fernando, shed, more light on 
  the situation in the Jaffna lagoon:</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>Referring to Sea Tiger activity it said: &quot;Most 
  of their activity is in the Jaffna Lagoon, using locally made 33 foot fibre 
  glass dinghies powered by 3 or more out-board motors. The origin of the motors 
  is a mystery, but large shipments have been seized both in India and the port 
  of Colombo.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&quot;A few of the craft are even foreign built, 
  using five high powered out-board motors which can attain speeds of 45 knots 
  (Sea miles per hour). At times even the fastest navy Dvora Fast Attack craft 
  have been unable to intercept them..... (The Sea Tigers) also use sophisticated 
  equipment like radar to track down navy vessels. Many are mounted on land vehicles, 
  which make them highly mobile, while others are at high points in the peninsula 
  and are hard to detect.&quot;</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&quot;...In a three week period in September, at 
  least 15 Sea Tiger boats were sunk in the lagoon, as well as three more off 
  the east coast of the peninsula. This in a sharp increase in Sea Tiger loses; 
  in contrast only about 35 craft were sunk the whole of last year and another 
  40 were sunk in the first ll months of this year&quot;.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The feature places the Sea Tiger strength 
  at 300. &quot; They are believed to have undergone training clandestinely in 
  India, Malaysia and Singapore, with Chinese, Norwegian and Singaporean mercenaries 
  as instructors.&quot;</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;If one places a modest average of 3 Sea tigers 
  in each boat sunk, nearly the whole unit, one needs to believe, has been slaughtered!</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;There was not the slightest acknowledgement 
  in the feature that the bulk of those traversing the lagoon were civilians taking 
  2 1/2 to 3 hours in slow boats to do the 20 or so miles( hardly 7 or 8 knots 
  - nowhere near the 45 knots said to be touched by advanced Tiger boats).</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;As to why the Tigers want civilians going 
  south to cross the lagoon from Kilaly rather than use Elephant Pass is contained 
  in a suggestion with which most civilian observers would agree: &quot; The lagoon 
  is more than just the last link to the mainland for the Tigers. It is also their 
  safest route to India&quot;. ( Via Wilpattu National Park and the West coast 
  south of Mannar).</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;From the foregoing what is really going on 
  is clear. Here again we find a persistent trend in the southern polity, the 
  state, the forces, and the press.They refuse to take or acknowledge responsibility 
  for the Tamil civilians who do not cease being citizens of this country. They 
  cross the lagoon to meet urgent survival tasks. Those who so cross the lagoon 
  include senior government servants, professionals and dons coming for seminars 
  and other official business in Colombo. Also included are university staff and 
  others who came down for scholarship interviews at the UGC or examinations and 
  then missed them either because they had been informed too late or because the 
  police in Colombo locked them up.How they live and travel does not appear to 
  be an issue. There is a pretence that they are some kind of hob goblins who 
  pop out of the earth and disappear thence. Thus does Tamil chauvinism receive 
  an undeserved legitimacy.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;It is against the backdrop of an intellectual 
  and moral paralysis closely linked to the aforementioned events that peace moves 
  and talks of constitutional reform are going on. The most important constituency 
  - the people, Muslims, Tamils and Sinhalese - is ignored.</span> <a href="#_Toc515973201">[Top]</a></p>
<h3><a name="_Toc515973207">1.5 Peace Moves</a> </h3>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;We will confine ourselves to some salient 
  features without going into details. It has been our position that the main 
  issue of a permanent settlement is not federalism or a merger of the former 
  Northern and Eastern Provinces. It is but one of giving confidence to the minorities 
  that they are full partners in the nation building process and that the state 
  will neither discriminate nor its machinery work to their detriment. Also if 
  the damage done in the past is to be overcome, there needs to be a more open 
  and generous approach. The Tamils in the North-East have long and urgently voiced 
  particular grievances touching on security concerning the conduct of the forces 
  and state aided colonisation of Sinhalese resulting in insecurity to others.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;These are matters on which, we have repeatedly 
  pointed out (<a
href="../Report6/Report6.htm">Reports 6</a>,<a
href="../Report7/Report7.htm">7</a> &amp; <a
href="../../Briefings/Briefing1.htm">Briefing No1</a>) the state ought to act 
  on its own as a matter of duty. To make such action a subject of negotiation 
  only reinforces distrust. Two specific areas requiring such action are the provision 
  for real remedial action (not the cosmetic one of presidential task forces) 
  to challenge violations by the forces and the making of substantial positive 
  gestures regarding colonisation. A good candidate for the latter would be the 
  dismantling of the Weli Oya or Manal Aru settlements which are in any case a 
  costly shambles. Whatever the merits of Weli Oya settlements, these have been 
  trumpeted too long by Sinhalese chauvinists in Colombo (not Weli Oya) as to 
  frighten Tamils. It is from such developments that the merger of the North-East 
  as a security measure came to be seen as necessary by the Tamils. It was given 
  a new force by the Indo-Lanka Accord. The situation in the Jaffna lagoon, bombing 
  and shelling are other areas where the government can and ought to make positive 
  gestures.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The government has done next to nothing on 
  these lines, thus casting a shadow over any talks that take place. Even so new 
  constitutional measures that could give confidence to the minorities could play 
  a benign role. Two proposals before the parliamentary select committee chaired 
  by Mangala Moonesinghe that received publicity were the Apex Council proposal 
  for a semi-merger of the North and East and the second for federalism without 
  a merger proposed by Srinivasan MP. The first, widely accepted as well-meant, 
  was worked out by Mangala Moonesinghe himself with help from some leading academics. 
  The second was noted for the magic words federalism and de-merger. Its details 
  were sketchy and ill-thought out. Why it received so much publicity is a subject 
  of much speculation.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Both had certain positive or negative merits 
  from the point of all communities in the North-East. For the Tamils, up to 4O% 
  of their population in the North-East, particularly the East, were refugees. 
  There was a fear that a long war fought in the name of a merger would mean displacement, 
  rather than a merger, becoming permanent, leading to creeping colonisation of 
  Sinhalese under military protection. From this point of view a transfer of power 
  from the military to a civilian authority in the East was desirable.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The Muslims in the East feared, particularly 
  after massacres of Muslims by the LTTE, that a large Tamil dominated unit would 
  work to their disadvantage. They too, in terms of a fear of colonisation, stood 
  to gain by local civilian, rather than military control.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The Sinhalese in the East shared the first 
  fear with the Muslims.[See <a href="../Report7/Report7.htm">Report No7</a> &amp; 
  Rev. Nirmal Mendis in the Cross-Points, an NCC publication, December 1990 and 
  September 1992].</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;For the Tamils there were also some merits 
  in trading off a merger for more powerful federal units. For the Tamil parties 
  in Colombo these proposals carried strong temptations provided they were seen 
  to be realisable. This is where the experience of the past and the failure of 
  the government to show good faith, such as in a manner sketched above, became 
  serious impediments. There were also doubts as to whether a federal proposal 
  would withstand the referendum demanded by the constitution even after obtaining 
  two thirds support in the house.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The chief impediment came from the main parties 
  (UNP&amp;SLFP) who remained studiedly reluctant to commit themselves, while 
  the Tamil parties were under intense pressure to commit themselves. There was 
  a real fear that having agreed to drop the merger, which had the force of the 
  Indo-Lanka Accord, they would be left clutching at straws in the wind. They 
  feared that they were being used as land mines against the LTTE. After the two 
  main parties agreed to back a consensus at select committee level they appeared 
  to grudgingly concede something only to claw back later. It was first reported 
  that they had both accepted Srinivasan's proposal for federalism without merger. 
  This was later changed to the Indian model and finally Srinivasan without federalism.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The problem was ultimately that we, perhaps 
  in good faith, had very fluid notions of constitution making, based on passing 
  whims of individuals which ignored the people. The years since July 1983 and 
  the Indo-Lanka Accord were painful experiences for this country. The positive 
  features of the Accord as regards the ethnic issue were not effectually realised. 
  The machinations of this government prevented the provincial councils from coming 
  to be seen as genuinely autonomous bodies with real and adequate powers. The 
  North-East provincial council practically gave way to some unspecified understanding 
  between the government and the LTTE. The justification hinted at for this was 
  that the EPRLF though `elected' did not represent the Tamils. How the LTTE came 
  to represent the Tamils was never addressed. The government-LTTE understanding 
  fell to pieces and the Tamils were once more left with nothing but the dubious 
  protection of the LTTE. If the Tamil parties in Colombo rescind the merger, 
  that will be gladly publicised and used. But if tomorrow another deal with the 
  LTTE is desired it would once more be hinted that the Tamil political parties 
  represented nobody. Some years later it could be argued that the present government's 
  legitimacy was in question or that the LTTE became the representatives of Tamils 
  on doubtful premises and we would be talking something else as if yesterday 
  was a dream.</span> <br>
  <span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The SLFP's positions again represent instability 
  and double talk.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>The DPA manifesto on which Mrs Bandaranaike contested 
  the 1988 presidential elections envisaged a merged North-East with a part of 
  Amparai District excised. Recently she was reported saying that her party did 

  not support a merger. The DPA manifesto she said was rejected by the people. 
  But she had contested the verdict of her defeat in court saying that it was 
  arrived at by fraudulent means. It is by all indications therefore futile to 
  think that the talks as they stand would lead to a solution.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The Tamil parties could however have done 
  much better than turn down the proposals merely on the grounds that they did 
  not envisage a North-East merger. They should have been clearly and logically 
  examined and argued how they meet or fail to meet the aspirations of Tamils 
  for dignity and security, and here based their acceptance or rejection on reason. 
  This would have at least led to a healthy debate and a clear discussion of issues. 
  Instead the other side was not made to discuss issues and merely confronted 
  the Tamil parties with a flat rejection of a merger. We are being further plunged 
  into a culture where the value of sound reason is being lost, and who represents 
  whom determined ultimately through brute force.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;What would lead to a solution is only an 
  open discussion of issues and how we came to this point of paralysis. If the 
  leaders address the people, involve them in a public discussion and convince 
  them, then any resulting solution will have permanent roots. There will be no 
  need to whisper consent and claw back. When it was first announced in the press 
  that the two main parties had accepted federalism, the country accepted it as 
  a matter of course. There was perhaps a sigh of relief rather than angry demonstrations.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The present state of affairs will favour 
  only the extreme nationalists on both sides. They are the only ones talking 
  to the people. By ignoring real Sinhalese and Muslim fears, it is easy to represent 
  to the Tamils how the others cannot be trusted. By focusing on the LTTE and 
  ignoring the Tamil people and recent history, the other extremist camp could 
  argue that given the LTTE's persistent duplicity, only a military solution is 
  possible.</span> <a href="#_Toc515973201">[Top]</a></p>
<h3><a name="_Toc515973208">1.6 The Role of NGOs, Religious bodies and Non-party 
  organisations</a> </h3>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Things as they are, leave the country poised 
  dangerously. The ordinary people feel confused and powerless and now the armed 
  forces are in the same state. Against this the LTTE goes on massacring Muslim 
  and Sinhalese civilians, ignoring the diplomatic reverses and hoping that the 
  next heave would do the trick. Its mind is clear. It can live with de facto 
  control like in the months leading up to the current war. But survival dictates 
  that it cannot be tied down by written legal undertakings, even a federal arrangement. 
  It has cornered itself by killing in the name of the holy cause of Eelam and 
  building up its cadre on the basis of Eelam or nothing and that anyone who thinks 
  otherwise is a traitor. The alternative to de facto control is to trigger off 
  anti-Tamil violence int the South. Then its own past would be forgotten, and 
  it could expect a diplomatic swing in its favour. The country would then for 
  all purposes be sundered. The LTTE's closest allies would then have been its 
  vocal Sinhalese counter- parts. How strong is the polity of this country to 
  withstand this challenge?</span> </p>

<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;As was pointed out there is a certain despair 
  among those who were close to dead combatants on all sides as to whether they 
  died&nbsp; to any purpose. A note about the late Brigadier Lucky Wijeratne by 
  K.H. in the Sunday Times of 2Oth December reads:</span> <br>
  <span style='color:#990000'>&quot;A soldier, particularly a commander who must 
  send out men to kill or be killed, will frequently question the logic of and 
  the motives behind a war-- We can ensure that they did not die in vain by bringing 
  about a political settlement that was their pot of gold at the end of a rainbow. 
  A prolonged battle with a heavy loss of life, even if the ultimate result is 
  a military victory for the security forces, will not justify the death of Lucky 
  and his colleagues. The final chapter of Lucky's story must be written by the 
  politicians.&quot;</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;By their performance so far it is doubtful 
  if the politicians by themselves will ever write the final chapter. It is only 
  a demand from the people that would move them. Thus it becomes imperative that 
  others must talk to them and restore the value of sound reason and sound morals 
  rather than leave the field to extremists. It is now left to the kind of organisations 
  mentioned above to campaign for rational solutions, and open up the issues by 
  going before the people. The country's predicament must be clearly understood. 
  Only so can the country derive strength. There must be an end to the illusion 
  that the road to peace lies through secret flattery of those who control the 
  means of destruction and keeping the people in the dark. If the LTTE clearly 
  understands that there is no prospect of communal violence in the South, its
