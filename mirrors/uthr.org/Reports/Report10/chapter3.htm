<h3 align=center style='text-align:center'>&nbsp; </h3>
<h3><a name="_Toc515974021">3.1 Priorities</a> </h3>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The following story was related to us by 
  a young man who was until recently a member of the LTTE and served in all capacities 
  including as a member of the&nbsp; intelligence unit. Apart from the earnest 
  indignation he feels for his past, his accounts appear to be truthful and are 
  consistent with everything else he says, together with what we have documented 
  over the years.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Among those who had frequent access to the 
  LTTE leader are members of the intelligence and finance units. Addressing a 
  meeting where members from both units were present, the leader told them in 
  words to the effect: &quot;You are the most important section&nbsp; of this 
  movement. Those who are fighting will die some time. We need not be too concerned 
  about them. You are the ones that will be left to run Tamil Eelam. Therefore 
  it is among you that we want greater discipline and loyalty.&quot; The leader 
  then went on to give his vision of the state of Tamil Eelam: &quot;Eventually 
  the whole movement must become an intelligence unit. Indeed the whole nation 
  will become an intelligence unit&quot;</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;This is not as fantastic as it sounds. The 
  leader has been disarmingly frank on earlier occasions. Everything that has 
  been said by LTTE leaders and its actions over the years add up to this. Yogi 
  said more than five years ago that what was of importance was to safeguard the 
  soil (mun) of Tamil Eelam. To this end the loss of the overwhelming majority 
  of lives was to be of little account. Then there was Mahattaya's attempts to 
  organise the families of `martyrs' into a network of informers over the national 
  heroes week of 1990. [<a
href="../Report6/Report6.htm">Report No.6</a>]. Further, financial operations, 
  both locally and internationally have been meticulously organised and run for 
  years by close personal associates of the leader and accountable only to him. 
  Many of these operations do not come into the main organisational structure 
  - the military one. The spartan restrictions which ordinary cadre are supposed 
  to observe, do not apply to these operators. Any vice is overlooked provided 
  they enjoy the leader's confidence in matters of importance to him. Moreover 
  nearly all of them are connected to the leader by ties of kin or clan. Notable 
  in this whole phenomenon is the symbolic importance of land and gold as opposed 
  to life and a wholesome enjoyment of it.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;What comes through is some of the worst traditions 
  and methods of Jaffna society.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Again the insignificance of the fighting 
  cadre whose sacrifices were regularly lauded from platforms for public consumption 
  has been known for a long time. Despite the titles, glories and adoration heaped 
  on them by the leader and the organisation, the cadre often came to realise 
  that they counted for little. Their minds and bodies were needed only to destroy 
  and kill. It was well known by 1987 that the Kittus, and perhaps even the Mahattayas, 
  had no real power in the organisation, as much as they could kill ordinary civilians 
  with impunity. Real power, apart from the leader, lay in the hands of selected 
  individuals in the five continents building up the LTTE's financial empire, 
  besides their own.</span> <a href="#_Toc515974019">[Top]</a></p>
<h3><a name="_Toc515974022">3.2 Effects on the Organisation</a> </h3>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;As we had mentioned before many mature cadre 
  who sensed their real position of powerlessness started leaving the organisation 
  as painful developments from the mid 8Os unfolded what the future held. The 
  emphasis on recruitment then shifted to children. The organisation evolved to 
  adapt itself playing on the sensibilites and fears of the young. There was no 
  longer any need for theoreticians to package the LTTE's programme in the language 
  and jargon of liberation movements. The political wing all but vanished. With 
  the ensuing disruption to education, the middle classes and those with contacts 
  outside responded by increasingly sending their children away. The result was 
  that new recruits were both very young and from the poorer sections. Thus the 
  composition of cadre from Jaffna shifted sharply towards the oppressed castes.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The importance given to the use of terror 
  and the intelligence unit had its own momentum. In jockeying for influence, 
  every section of an institution has a natural tendency to multiply its scale 
  of operations and demonstrate such a necessity. Nothing serves this purpose 
  so much as a massive operation involving the holding of prisoners. Mere killing 
  is too ephemeral and simplistic an activity. Nothing strikes terror so much 
  as torture chambers and long time inhuman confinement. It is not for nothing 
  that the Gestapo and KGB embarked on massive prisoner operations costly as they 
  were, and so with the LTTE. This has also given the LTTE a capacity for massive 
  civil engineering enterprises using labour intensive technology.</span><a href="#_Toc515974019">[Top]</a> 
</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc515974023">3.3.Influence on Caste</a> </h3>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;We have pointed to the numerical shift towards 
  oppressed castes among the fighting cadre. The instrumental importance attached 
  to such persons may in certain areas give the impression that caste as an institution 
  is being challenged. But this is deceptive as the foregoing would suggest.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The story of Senkathir gives an illustration 
  of how caste operates. When the old Left groups raised the caste issue, they 
  worked among ordinary oppressed caste peasants, raised their level of intellect 
  and discipline, and made of them responsible persons compelling respect. This 
  is very different from taking a person, whether low caste or high caste, and 
  using his worst instincts. Senkathir was a person so used of low caste origin 
  from the Karaveddy area. Though an unruly person, he being Mahattayas's protege, 
  wielded considerable influence. It was widely believed in Karaveddy, that one 
  of Senkathir's briefs was to watch over, and report on the local leader Gamini. 
  Gamini was of high caste from the same area. Gamini was later transferred and 
  lost a leg in a futile attempt on Jaffna Fort in July/August 1990. The local 
  people viewed both Gamini and Senkathir through the spectacles of caste. While 
  Senkathir's star was ascendent, it appeared to give the low castes the edge 
  in local influence. The high castes viewed Senkathir with a detestation not 
  improved by his reported obsession with high caste mistresses. During the Autumn 
  of 1990 Mahattaya's men were removed from key positions. About this time Senkathir 
  went missing, reported by the LTTE as killed in action in the Wanni jungles. 
  The story was not believed by his community which became bitter and suspicious. 
  This individual instance tells us one thing. An organisation which debases humanity 
  and views people as mere instruments, can have no lasting reforming impact on 
  society.</span> <a href="#_Toc515974019">[Top]</a><br>
  &nbsp; </p>
<h3><a name="_Toc515974024">3.4 Impact on the Middle Class</a> </h3>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;A dominant characteristic of this class is 
  a materialistic value system overlaid by the presumptions of Tamil nationalism. 
  One could be surprised by the lack of anger or indignation one finds among uncles, 
  aunts and cousins of someone very unjustly killed by the LTTE, as opposed to 
  the Sri Lankan forces. The LTTE wearing the mantle of Tamil nationalism has 
  used it to deflect accountability. We recently had an instance of how nationalism 
  is used as an opium to deflect real issues. A deservedly well respected TULF 
  MP of the Batticaloa District was speaking at a school function. He expressed 
  his joy at the song about the ancient Tamil King Cheran Senguttuvan who reportedly 
  ruled the Himalayas. Then he said how proud he was about the Tamil youth taking 
  up arms to fight for the people's rights - a remarkable speech that could have 
  been transposed from a TULF platform to an LTTE platform and vice versa. The 
  real problem and an urgent one is systematically skipped. This was that the 
  boys supposedly fighting for rights were massacring Muslims turning the East 
  into a powder keg.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Terror and the allure of nationalism have 
  imposed on the people the habit of silence. Wherever Sri Lankan forces are in 
  control, people are subject to a good deal of unpredictability and humiliation. 
  But in Jaffna people have come to believe that by not questioning the politics 
  or raising questions about political prisoners and the arming of children, life 
  becomes relatively predictable. The ugly things are kept out of sight and people 
  can move about safely in the nights. Conditioning their minds to use this atomised 
  existence as a starting point, they try to work out the means to send their 
  children out. In the short term this works well for the LTTE.</span> <a href="#_Toc515974019">[Top]</a></p>
<h3><a name="_Toc515974025">3.5.The Role of Institutions</a> </h3>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The only institutions in Jaffna with fairly 
  large bases are the university and the churches. One would have normally expected 
  from these institutions some resistance to the unhealthy and dangerous developments. 
  If it is felt that in the interests of the future, these institutions must be 
  kept alive through a phase of terror, they could at least avoid lending legitimacy 
  to these developments. We have dealt with the University of Jaffna in earlier 
  reports. We have also noted in earlier reports how several members of the elite 
  perform services glorifying this brutal political phenomenon. Such legitimisation 
  is in turn used to entice more children to carry arms. These elites and their 
  children are in turn exempt from the rigours to which other hapless people are 
  subject.</span> <br>
  <span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;We shall now take some instances of how some 
  churches and church men have become catalysts in this downward spiral.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;To start with, few churches as institutions 
  in the recent past were seen to be excelling in character and improving the 
  tone of life in Jaffna. Then by identifying with the nationalist cause and by 
  their ability to articulate the cause abroad, their authority increased tremendously. 
  Further, the churches became recipients of large funds for rehabilitation.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Then came the July 1983 anti-Tamil violence. 
  The response of the churches in the South was seen as either communal, inadequate 
  or nominal by their partners abroad. Over the years a strong feeling of guilt 
  overlaid key sections of the Southern church to a point where it became fashionable 
  to be uncritically `pro-Tamil' particularly with statements made for largely 
  foreign consumption.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;In the meantime most Tamil churchmen got 
  into another fashionable rut. Whenever they came down from Jaffna they rightly 
  talked about the sufferings of the people resulting from bombing, shelling and 
  other restrictions placed by the government. But as for harsh restrictions placed 
  by the LTTE, arming of children and political prisoners, they are absolutely 
  silent - few might whisper these to close friends. In turn the more discerning 
  and truly concerned Southern churchmen are afraid to raise these unspoken issues 
  for the fear of being branded anti-Tamil. It appears to become disturbingly 
  fashionable among Southern churchmen not to want to grapple with details and 
  understand the Tamil question in depth. It is becoming all to easy to blindly 
  concur with colleagues from the North in matters such as what is really going 
  in Jaffna, who represents the Tamil people and what the normal run of people 
  really want. If for example those from&nbsp; the North say `ceasefire', then 
  all agree it shall be ceasefire with no clear idea of what it demands from the 
  church.Attempts by the church to represent reality have conspicuously played 
  down the issue of political prisoners in the North and the Muslim question, 
  thus displaying a dangerous slant in legitimising something totally unchristian.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;With the national church so uncritical and 
  having no definite perspective the same attitude was passed onto important sections 
  of the World Council of Churches. To some individuals in the WCC it became enough 
  to be pro-Tamil, which meant to back the LTTE as the sole legitimate representatives 
  of the Tamil people. The game for them was to humour some Tamil prelates rather 
  than understand the problem. Those who did understand found it diplomatic not 
  to go too far with their reservations. Ultimately it is the interests of the 
  Tamils that suffered through legitimising unhealthy impositions.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Let us take how this worked in a particular 
  instance. In addition to being bombed and shelled, Tamils travelling between 
  Colombo and Jaffna have to undertake an unwanted and risky journey by sea bypassing 
  Elephant Pass. Apart from rough sea, they need to risk being attacked by the 
  forces. The army has ordered civilians not to take that route and to use Elephant 
  Pass instead. But the LTTE has forbidden the use of Elephant Pass and forces 
  people to use the sea route. Both sides have given military reasons for their 
  positions. The LTTE claims that if civilians use Elephant Pass, the army could 
  use it as an advance route. The army claims that if civilians use the sea route, 
  the LTTE would use civilian cover to transport men and munitions. We will not 
  examine the virtues of the military claims.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Where the people are concerned they are clear 

  that travelling by sea is a needless imposition and that once the route through 
  Elephant Pass is open, even the food supply to Jaffna will be eased. They feel 
  helpless and want someone to represent their interests. The churches are best 
  placed to do this. Criticising the forces for attacking helpless civilians travelling 
  by sea with a view to preventing it is legitimate. But doing only that is questionable. 
  What is also involved is the perception that it is less risky to travel by sea 
  against the army's wishes than to travel through Elephant Pass against the LTTE's 
  wishes. By the churches and other organaizations mounting a campaign exclusively 
  against the army while not challenging the LTTE, they were not representing 
  the people's interests. This was another aspect of a society where institutions 
  which are meant to be closest to the people are being mobilised to their discomfiture.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;How some church leaders more or less willingly 
  got into this position is another story. Strangely, of all organisations, it 
  was left to the BBC correspondent to take on the LTTE concerning the safety 
  of travellers. If this is how the churches have handled a more or less straight- 
  forward issue which still lies unresolved, how will they handle the complex 
  questions of a sustained ceasefire?</span> <a href="#_Toc515974019">[Top]</a></p>
