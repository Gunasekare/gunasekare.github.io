<h3>&nbsp; </h3>
<h3><a name="_Toc515974206">4.0 An overview</a> </h3>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Since our <a href="../Report9/Report9.htm">Report 
  No 9</a><a
href="..\..\..\..\uthrj\Reports\Report9\Report9.htm.htm"> </a>was issued in February 
  1992, a wealth of information has emerged about detainees held by the LTTE. 
  The information published hitherto has been summarised in <a
href="../../Briefings/Briefing1.htm">Briefing No.1. </a>In what follows we summarise 
  a heap of information to aid those actively concerned. We point out certain 
  patterns without giving these the status of conclusions. The latter will have 
  to await more complete information. The patterns should aid understanding as 
  well as to direct action. Our informants who are former members of the LTTE 
  and former prisoners have left the North-East.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;In <a href="../../Briefings/Briefing1.htm">Briefing 
  No.1</a>&nbsp; we stated that the estimates of the total number of prisoners 
  as varying around 4000. The number in the Thunukkai complex was estimated at 
  3000 and a thousand elsewhere. Thunukkai is now believed to be closed and the 
  inmates have been distributed to several camps. Prison camps, either exclusive 
  or part of LTTE camps, are known to exist or to have existed in Kachchai, Koilakandy 
  (on Thachchanthoppu - Sungupiddy Road), Urelu (in a commercial Farm), Kopay 
  (Heroes Hall, next to the women's camp), Kondavil, Chundikuli, Ariyalai (Maniam 
  Thottam) and more than 10 around Chavakacheri. This list is far from being exhaustive. 
  Villagers in a part of Karaveddy, near Nelliady, know that the local LTTE camp 
  keeps prisoners in underground bunkers. The local wisdom is `Do not talk about 
  them unless you want to join them'. Among these camps, some have as few as 3O 
  detainees. The one at Koilakandy had several hundred. Figures given to us vary 
  from 150 to over 500. The number killed following aerial bombing in Kachchai 
  is put at more than 50. The ones in Thenmaratchi, sited in sparsely populated 
  coconut estates facilitate holding larger numbers. Though the treatment in most 
  of them is uniformly inhuman, the security in the smaller camps is not as elaborate 
  as in the Thunukkai complex. An old man succeeded in escaping twice from the 
  Urelu camp.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;There are indications that some of the larger 
  prison camps where the treatment is more sadistic are still sited in the jungles 
  between Mullaitivu and Mankulam. According to one prisoner who was transferred 
  from `Malli' camp in the jungle near Mankulam on the Mullaitivu Road,the prisoners 
  were kept in several bunkers - 20 to 30 in one bunker-smaller than the Thunukkai 
  ones. There are no reports of escape. The details again give substance to the 
  estimate of the total number of prisoners being about 4000.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;As remarkable as this may be, it has aroused 
  comparatively little indignation either locally or internationally. The local 
  reasons are more involved and were discussed in the previous chapter. The international 
  reasons are simpler. Interest in Sri Lanka in the international media has sharply 
  declined.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;In circles that have an economic interest 
  in Sri Lanka, the North-East has been written off-at least this is what senior 
  government officials seem to believe. Equally, there is no vested interest in 
  exposing the scandal of prisoners in comparison with cases where big power interests 
  are involved. Individual journalists visiting Jaffna who casually pursued the 
  matter of prisoners, understandably did not get far. Some leading news organisations 
  appear to believe that if their correspondents cannot lay their hands on this 
  phenomenon, it cannot exist. Again attempts to expose this can deprive newsmen 
  of highly newsworthy access to the Tigers - almost handed out on a platter. 
  All in all the work of concealment for the Tigers has been made comparatively 
  easy and the small efforts at exposure all the more difficult and hazardous.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;We shall now go into aspects that will clarify 
  and add to earlier accounts.</span> <span style='color:#990000'><a href="#_Toc515974205">[Top]</a></span></p>
<p><b><span style='color:#990000'>4.1 What motivates the Tigers to hold so many 
  prisoners?</span></b> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Going through all accounts, one sees no trace 
  of compassion for prisoners. If some camp warden evinces the slightest weakness 
  of that kind, he or she will be quickly removed. This poses the question, why 
  keep prisoners alive considering that the Sri Lankan forces had no difficulty 
  in killing off thousands of prisoners taken? The answers need to be partial 
  and have been touched upon in&nbsp; <a href="../../Briefings/Briefing1.htm">Briefing 
  No.1.</a> We are here talking about some prominent tendencies - the LTTE does 
  conduct massacres and the Sri Lankan Forces do keep prisoners.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The Sri Lankan state was conceived as a liberal 
  - democratic institution. The pillars of such an institution are a system of 
  laws and agencies for enforcement which derive legitimacy by acting according 
  to a given set of rules. Two decades of repressive legislation have introduced 
  parallel systems of law, or in short, lawlessness. This in turn has led the 
  armed forces to act in such a manner as to lose that sense of legitimacy, leading 
  to demoralisation and a loss of direction. Thus killing becomes a thoughtless 
  act of unrestrained human passion, akin to banditry. There is little conception 
  of acting in the name of an institution. Also,there is room for individual officers 
  and soldiers to show compassion and not be persecuted for it.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The Tigers in conception were a very different 
  kind of organisation. The description of the prison camp in Thunukkai (<a
href="../Report9/Report9.htm">Report No 9&nbsp;</a> &amp; <a href="../../Briefings/Briefing1.htm">Briefing 
  No.1</a> ), the whole pattern of camps and the meticulous administration of 
  the system give the appearance of being consciously drawn from films and books 
  about the Nazi and Stalinist prison complexes. If we look at the phenomenon 
  taking into account these historical precedents, a consciousness of power requires 
  objects over whom power is exercised. An exulting feeling of absolute power 
  requires servile objects whose humanity is totally&nbsp;&nbsp; debased.</span> 
  <span style='color:#990000'><a href="#_Toc515974205">[Top]</a></span></p>
<h3><a name="_Toc515974207">4.2 The Wardens of the Gulag</a> </h3>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Through a process of selection and elimination, 
  the persons running the show have the distinctions of cruelty and blind obedience 
  to the leadership. Beyond this their private foibles are of little concern to 
  the organisation. Working with the wardens in some camps are members of the 
  intelligence unit, whose task is to extract information.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Kanthi known as the butcher was earlier at 

  the torture chamber at Thunukkai. Mampalam (38) of Myliddy was taken there accused 
  of being an IPKF informer. Of the ten being tortured `Katkandu' of Palaly was 
  asked by Kanthi if he recognised any of the others. He pointed at Mamapalam 
  and another from Palaly. Kanthi aimed a blow at Mampalam with a pole. Out of 
  excruciating pain Mampalam screamed some swear words. The other Tigers standing 
  around proceeded to beat Mampalam to death with wooden and metal rods.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Following the closure of Thunukkai after 
  the outbreak of war, Kanthi was moved eventually to the centre at Koilakandy. 
  This camp was the successor to the one at Kachchai bombed in August 199O. During 
  torture a detainee had fainted. Kanthi left him, went to do something else and 
  returned. Seeing that the victim of torture had been given medical attention, 
  Kanthi went into a rage. Screaming, he ripped the bandages with a knife. He 
  then grabbed the handle of a pick axe and beat the victim to death.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Nirmalan was in charge of the camp at Koilakandy 
  and had imbibed a taste of good life earlier. According to the local grapevine 
  Nirmalan had been in a number of foreign countries including Singapore and others 
  in Europe, dealing in a number of LTTE operations involving the handling of 
  money. It is also believed that his new job was a sinecure following deportation 
  to Sri Lanka over an offence abroad. Using prison labour and materials obtained 
  by stripping public assets such as railways and government departments, he proceeded 
  to build for himself a luxury apartment. He surrounded himself with stolen domestic 
  and exotic animals and used Kannan, a sculptor and detainee to embellish is 
  apartment.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Things went smoothly until Nirmalan quarrelled 
  with Kanthi, a man from the intelligence unit. Nirmalan was transferred. Kanthi 
  set free the love birds and doves and over a period consumed the pigs and peacocks. 
  The horse, he retained for his use. Nirmalan's castle was demolished by the 
  same detainees who built it and the materials were sent for building bunkers. 
  This much changed, but not the cruelty.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;During September 1991 Nirmalan and his sidekick 
  Kerdi beat to death in front of other prisoners a mechanic, Sivalingarajah, 
  from Chunnakam. Sivalingarajah had earlier repaired vehicles for the EPRLF as 
  he later did for the LTTE.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Pottu Amman is the top man in the intelligence 
  unit. During May 1991, a detainee named Sri, a former PLOTE member, escaped 
  from detention with his legs chained. The leaders of the camp were promptly 
  punished by the LTTE high command. Pottu Amman then took a hand. Sri's father, 
  two sisters and a cousin were brought to the camp and were tortured in separate 
  rooms. Then Pottu Amman asked the father to look at the daughters. Crawling 
  to their rooms the father saw the two daughters semi-conscious in pools of blood. 
  Pottu Amman subject the daughters to further cruel beating in the father's presence. 
  To prevent further harm to his daughters, he proceeded to name the places where 
  Sri may be hidden. Sri was re-arrested the next day. At the time of receipt 
  of this information, the family had not been released.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;In connection with Sri's escape, a 60 years 
  old a printer, and proprietor of `Dhurka Brothers' of Uduvil was taken to Kachchai, 
  accused of helping Sri. Here he was tortured by Kanthi (later at Koilakandy 
  as mentioned) and then sent to Urelu for confinement. Being unable to walk, 
  he was dragged into the camp by LTTE cadre. He passed away at 7.00 p.m. The 
  other detainees were asked to stitch his body in a sack. A pick up took away 
  the body in the night. His family was informed of his death six months later.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Among Pottu Amman's qualifications for the 
  job is his&nbsp; blind adulation of the leader. During 1984, in India, about 
  the time an oath of personal loyalty to the leader was introduced, some cadre 
  put some questions about the leader's conduct and about the claims of his position. 
  Pottu Amman, it is said, stuttered and went speechless with rage.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Another significant incident involving Pottu 
  Amman is the murder of Ruban. Ruban had left the LTTE in 1984 and was doing 
  work among refugees in Vetharanyam. While walking on the street Pottu Amman 
  was seen catching hold of Ruban and assaulting him. He was then taken away by 
  Pottu Amman's gang. The&nbsp; matter was reported by Ruban's friends to the 
  Indian Police and no action was taken. Nothing further being heard, Ruban was 
  presumed killed.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Today Pottu Amman's crew are being blamed 
  by the Indian Police of having killed Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, to the accompaniment 
  of crocodile tears about gun culture.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;A number of sources, including press reports, 
  have indicated that Pottu Amman was the intended victim of a bomb thrown near 
  Kopay. There are rumours that he was injured, but no official comment from the 
  LTTE.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Ambrose was in charge of a small camp and 
  faced punishment for the escape of a prisoner. By day, he had to be in a labour 
  camp with other prisoners making brooms. By night he had to trudge looking for 
  the escapee.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Kamal, high caste, from Puttur was in charge 
  of the camp at Urelu, when a prisoner William Kandasamy (60) was sent there. 
  William of oppressed caste, also from Puttur, was sent to the Urelu camp, accused 
  of being a womaniser. Two women with whom he had alleged links, it is said, 
  were publicly executed accused of being EPRLF members, and an example of EPRLF 
  un-Tamil decadence. Kamal, as the prisoners well knew, and as also the organisation 
  had inquired into, was not innocent of what William had been charged with. William 
  had in his younger days been an activist against caste oppression. William's 
  treatment was extra-ordinarily harsh. William escaped, through his wife contacted 
  Nirmalan at the Koilakandy camp and surrendered there. Kamal complained to Pottu 
  Amman, and William was restored to Urelu. William escaped the second time', 
  hid in the house of a Roman Catholic priest and contacted an international organisation. 
  Under the observation of this organisation and some senior clergy, William surrendered 
  to Valmi and Bosco of the intelligence unit at the Anaikkottai camp. William 
  was released 15 days later.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Several senior persons in the intelligence 
  unit are said to have left the LTTE over differences with Pottu Amman. Among 
  those who left are Daniel and Dinesh who were at Thunukkai and Ravi who was 
  at Chavacachcheri. Salim a senior man referred to in earlier reports in charge 
  of issuing travel permits, was later transferred to look after the welfare of 
  wounded cadre.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>Kerdi and two others were in charge of a group 
  known in Tiger circles as the `Special Task Force'. They took charge of legalised 
  robbery. Detainees were used to load the loot into vehicles and then unload 
  them.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>Among the wardens a common means of letting loose 
  their frustrations and humiliating detainees is to dwell insultingly on questions 
  of marital intimacy, as would be the case among regular soldiers.</span> <span style='color:#990000'><a href="#_Toc515974205">[Top]</a></span></p>
<h3><a name="_Toc515974208">4.3 Merchants in Prison</a> </h3>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>As said earlier, the elite sections of the LTTE 
  are those dealing with finance and intelligence, and not the fighting sections 
  glorified for popular consumption. This comes from the highest authority within 
  the organisation. These sections are led by persons, now middle aged like the 
  leader, and close to him through clan and kinship. Those dealing in finance 
  work closely with selected merchants, can grant them special favours and enjoy 
  considerable freedom in managing their private interests. This has enabled the 
  LTTE to monitor, control and exact payments from the entire merchant class. 
  The merchants in turn smuggle in rare materials, such as fuel, using their contacts. 
  When there is a smooth working relationship with the LTTE, life can be mutually 
  profitable. But yet curious circumstances have landed many of them in prison. 
  Several cases of merchants held are straightforward. They are or were held pending 
  payment of ransom, often beyond their means.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;During the IPKF presence many merchants were 
  placed in an unenviable position. Before the IPKF arrived, they already had 
  a working relationship with the LTTE. Later they tried to do a balancing act 
  between the LTTE and the pro-Indian groups. But the LTTE received an overwhelmingly 
  high proportion of their payments. Several of those in prison are said to have 
  been `fervently' pro-LTTE, as much as the word could apply to a businessman.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;As the IPKF withdrew members of pro-Indian 
  groups left some of their arms with traders for safe keeping, not suspecting 
  that these traders also dealt with the LTTE or were too scared to keep the arms. 
  As the LTTE took over, these traders handed over these arms to the LTTE. Some 
  however retained some revolvers and such like. This they did not to challenge 
  the LTTE. But as shrewd businessmen they suspected that the present order of 
  controlled robbery was not permanent, but may any time dissolve into anarchy. 
  Then they would have to protect themselves. One of them was Sri, of Valambikai 
  Stores, Stanley Road, Jaffna, who kept back two pistols. The Tigers came to 
  know of this through Anastine, a boat owner and contact of Sri, detained in 
  connection with unauthorised smuggling. Sri was detained and released after 
  paying a fine of Rs 1 1/2 lakhs. A similar fate overtook the proprietor of Every 
  Day Stores, Palaly. Whether he was released is not known.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>Ranganathan was the owner of Murugan hardware Stores 
  near the Chavacacheri Police Station, destroyed in the TELO attack of 1984. 
  Though an LTTE sympathiser, he had retained a revolver recovered from the ruins 
  of the police station. Kannan, a former member of the LTTE and recently appointed 
  by the LTTE to the local vigilance committee, led a gang of robbers. In robbing 
  Ranganathan's house, his revolver had also been taken. Later apprehended by 
  the LTTE, Kannan told everything. Ranganathan was arrested and sent to Urelu. 
  Kannan and co were put to sleep.</span> <br>
  <span style='color:#990000'>Marimuthtu Satkunam had a small shop in Palaly and 
  was arrested on the charge that he had sold the EPRLF paper `Viduthalai' during 
  the IPKF presence. Several months later, on 1Oth June 199O, he was released 
  and ordered to leave the Tamil region within a month. This he was unable to 
  do owing to the outbreak of war. He was re-arrested on 18th August 199O.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>Gunaratnam, a wholesale rice merchant in Jaffna 
  was arrested on the charge that he had used another militant group to get rid 
  of an inconvenient person. He was released after buying a Pajero Jeep for the 
  LTTE. This happened before the war.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>Perhaps the most revealing of cases that have come 
  our way is that of Suthanantham, owner of SPS traders, Jaffna. Though close 
  to the Tigers, Suthanantham also did a balancing act. He also it appears, maintained 
  friendly contacts with a Tamil politician based in Colombo. Suthanantham was 
  also very close to Kutti, who was the LTTE leader's hand-picked man in charge 
  of supplies. Kutti boasted that it was he who kept the LTTE leader on, a full 
  stomach. He stopped lorries carrying goods from Colombo to Jaffna in the Vanni 
  jungles and took what he wanted. This was during the IPKF presence. Whatever 
  he wanted, whether food or fuel, Suthanantham brought it for him. In turn it 
  was spoken in Jaffna that anyone wanting goods transported safely without having 
  them robbed on the way would do well to use SPS.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>On one occasion Kanthi and Shoot of the LTTE's 
  intelligence unit asked Suthanantham to give them some fuel for their own use. 
  Suthanantham told them that all that he gives, he gives Kutti and that they 
  should ask him. Owing to his rapport with Kutti, the matter ended there for 
  the time being.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>Kanthi and Shoot had their chance much later. The 
  editor of &quot;Puththolir&quot; was kept under surveillance. On searching his 
  house they found a letter from the Tamil politician in Colombo, suggesting that 
  any sensitive letters could be sent through SPS. Kanthi and Shoot took in the 
  SPS proprietor Suthanantham. After being tortured and reminded of his earlier 
  refusal to give them fuel, he was told that his release was conditional upon 
  the payment of Rs 50 lakhs. As his wife was delivering a child, a fellow businessman 
  had him released for 48 hours on a personal guarantee. 4 months later he was 
  released upon the payment of Rs. 25 lakhs.</span> <span style='color:#990000'><a href="#_Toc515974205">[Top]</a></span></p>
<h3><a name="_Toc515974209">4.4 Other Detainees</a> </h3>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>Thangarajah, director of Education, Jaffna &amp; 
  the Editor of Puththolir were old friends of a politician in Colombo. The editor, 
  a school principal in addition, was an active member of several LTTE bodies. 
  But he was under surveillance because his friendship had come to the notice 
  of the LTTE. His wife while accompanied to Colombo by a tea shop owner, Maniam, 
  was searched by Theepan at Thandikulam, and a letter to the politician was found 
  in her possession. The editor's house was then searched and a letter from the 
  politician was found in which there was a reference to `Thanga' besides the 
  SPS (see above). All concerned were detained, although there was nothing remotely 
  subversivein the relationships. Maniam was tortured and released 5 months later. 
  There was no definite information about the others at the time of receipt of 
  information.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>Thiruchelvam of Navaly, whose brother-in-law was 
  in the EPRLF sold fish to the local EPRLF camp during the IPKF presence. He 
  was later detained by the LTTE and subsequently released. He was re-arrested 
  at the instigation of a local LTTE supporter. This time he was beaten to death 
  by Kanthi and his fellow minions.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>Parimalamuhan (60), a toddy tapper, was&nbsp; a 
  member of a Coconut and Palmyrah Products Sales Co-operative in Vadamaratchi. 
  He had a dispute with the administration which he accused of corruption. In 
  the sequel he was arrested as an EPRLF sympathiser.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>Karunaikadatcharaguru alias Kili (55) of Myliddy 
  was a strong sympathiser of the EROS who supported the LTTE during the IPKF 
  presence. He was called to the local EPRLF camp, warned and let off. He later 
  worked at the EPRLF's Palaly office. He was later arrested by the LTTE as a 
  traitor for not giving them information after it assumed control in Jaffna.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>Katkandu from Palaly&nbsp; was detained as an EPRLF 
  sympathiser by the LTTE as the IPKF withdrew. The LTTE tortured him on the assumption 
  that he knew the locations where weapons were hidden and under torture Katkandu 
  admitted wrongly that he knew where arms were buried. Following a futile search 
  the Tigers subject him to severe assault. Katkandu was later seen in prison 
  with one of his legs where the flesh shrunken and was rendered unusable.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>Muhundan, a young graduate of the University of 
  Peradeniya and a&nbsp; EPRLF&nbsp; member, was&nbsp; co-ordinating officer for 
  the North during the short-lived provincial administration. He was later arrested&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  and tortured very badly. He was kept in Thunukai camp and from the earlier accounts 
  of the escapees he was assumed&nbsp; dead. But according to recent information 
  he is alive and although not subject to routine physical torture, he is&nbsp; 
  treated humiliatingly. Sometimes they would give him pen and paper and ask him 
  to write about the strategy of the EPRLF. His writings would then be taken away 
  and studied. Some senior Tigers would then come and argue with him. Muhundan 
  would logically argue for the EPRLF position. When unable to answer him, the 
  LTTE leaders would strike him. After they leave, Muhundan may be subject to 
  a torture session.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;He has been told that his fiancee, also a 
  graduate of the same university, was a detainee in the women's camp. But in 
  truth she now lives in Colombo.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>Arulappu Judaharan (23) was a member of the EPRLF. 
  In March 1990 he was arrested in the sea off Falaly while attempting to flee 
  to India. His father, with 9 children, lost the use of his hands after being 

  hit by a Sri Lankan army shell and is without an income. But unknown to his 
  family Judaharan, with his head shaven and eyelashes pulled out has been languishing 
  in prison for 2 1/2 years.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>Alexander Benedict (35) and Karuppiah (29), both 
  from Palaly and Sivarajah from Myliddy were among the several boatmen detained 
  by the LTTE on suspicion of having aided EPRLF cadre to escape to India in early 
  199O.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>Jesudason alias Soori alias Gunalan of Gurunagar 
  Jaffna left the EPRLF in 1988 and lived in Colombo. He returned to Jaffna after 
  the LTTE assumed control, was arrested, tortured and released a year later. 
  He was re-arrested following a lady of Ariyalai close to the Tigers, complaining 
  that Jesudason had attempted to shoot her son in the Ariyalai sports grounds 
  in 1988. This time Kanthi plucked out his finger nails. But the three sons of 
  the lady of Ariyalai are living in Canada.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>Mudiappu Selvarajah of Oorani, KKS, Registrar of 
  Marriages, was arrested on the charge of registering marriages of EPRLF cadre

<h3><a name="_Toc515974210">4.5 Dangers faced by detainees - further information</a> 
</h3>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>See <a
href="../../Briefings/Briefing1.htm">Briefing No.1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; for information 
  published earlier</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>The main camp of the Tigers sited in Kondavil was 
  targeted by airforce bombers and missed. Expecting another attempt, The Tigers 
  shifted their main camp and transferred several of their detainees to the vacated 
  premises. When the place was successfully bombed on the second attempt, those 
  killed were all prisoners hoplessly shut up inside. Thus the Tigers let the 
  government kill several birds with one stone, giving them selves also pictures 
  for propaganda.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>We give here a slight variation of the account 
  of an incident given in Report No. 6 and Briefing No. 1 Although the source 
  this time is different, the facts are substantially the same.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>The LTTE prison camp at Kachchai was bombed by 
  the airforce in August 199O. One bomb hit a bunker where prisoners were kept. 
  The camp leader Kanthi came out from his hiding place once the bombers left, 
  sprayed the inside of the damaged bunker with his sub machine gun. The bunker 
  was then covered up. The camp was then moved to Koilakandy.</span> </p>
<h3><a name="_Toc515974211">4.6 Detainees and the ICRC</a> </h3>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>The occasional positive role played by the ICRC 
  in individual cases is exceptional and depended on several unusual circumstances. 
  There is as said earlier, no&nbsp; access to prisoners. Relatives of detainees 
  through invisible forces at work have been conditioned to believe that should 
  they complain to the ICRC, their loved one will be reported dead. The LTTE tries 
  to handle the problem through a mixture of terror and false hopes. A few months 
  ago the LTTE controlled newspapers announced: &quot;Ten traitors freed,&quot; 
  in an attempt to deflect attention from a very large problem.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>About mid - 1992, a rumour took root among relatives 
  of detainees that they were being asked to report the detentions to the ICRC. 
  Hundreds, some say up to two thousand, marched towards the ICRC office in Jaffna. 
  Close to the office, they were intercepted by some persons who directed them 
  to complain to the National Red Cross, Jaffna Branch, so that their complaints 
  would be forwarded to the ICRC. Since nothing came out of it, it is assumed 
  that the complaints did not go beyond the Red Cross.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>The local Red Cross had some persons who are well-motivated. 
  But even during the IPKF presence it was infiltrated by LTTE agents and the 
  IPKF had even complained about it. Some idea of how the Red Cross functions 
  now is evident from a recent occurrence. Those in the LTTE believed to be Mahattaya's 
  men as opposed to Prabakaran's, were weeded out from all influential positions. 
  About this time the entire board of the Red Cross was changed. For the relatives 
  of detainees, the ICRC flag flies as a symbol of unrealisable hope.</span> <span style='color:#990000'><a href="#_Toc515974205">[Top]</a></span></p>
<h3><a name="_Toc515974212">4.7 Malli Camp</a> </h3>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;A prisoner, among a group of 30, was taken 
  to Malli camp by mistake and was returned after a day. The access to the camp 
  is on foot through dense jungle, after going towards Mullaitivu by road from 
  Mankulam. The prisoners were walked with their legs chained. The prisoner conveyed 
  there by mistake was left outside, while the others were taken into bunkers 
  containing each about 20 to 30. Not only do the sun's rays hardly penetrate 
  the dense foliage, but the prisoners are kept covered in even darker bunkers 
  with their legs chained. They are brought out only for meals. These prisoners 
  are said to be condemned with no hope of release. No one, it is believed, escaped.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;On this day one prisoner was having diarrhoea. 
  The others unable to bear the smell, screamed. The warden paid no attention. 
  When brought out for a meal, he ordered all prisoners in that bunker to dip 
  their forefinger in the excreta. They were then ordered to eat with the remaining 
  fingers in their right hand. They were then locked up in the bunker without 
  being allowed to wash their hand.</span> <span style='color:#990000'><a href="#_Toc515974205">[Top]</a></span></p>
<h3><a name="_Toc515974213">4.8 Prisoners and Caste</a> </h3>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;By all accounts reaching us, a very high 
  proportion of the LTTE's prisoners come from the oppressed castes. Some estimate 
  this at 9O%. This does not mean that the LTTE has strong ideas about caste either 
  way. An examination of this phenomenon supports our contention that the LTTE 
  is not a liberation group with any notion of reforming Jaffna society. Its clear 
  aim is a drive for power. To this end it will not waste time reforming society. 
  It would rather use and manipulate Jaffna society as it finds it.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;How this society works is illustrated by 
  the following incident. Although the external circumstances may be rare, the 
  internal working is typical. During the time of the EPRLF - led provincial administration, 
  it set up vigilance committees in the Palaly and Myliddy areas, comprising young 
  and elderly persons who understandably had little choice. When the LTTE took 
  over in early 199O all these persons were detained. Later, the high castes were 
  mostly released. Those sent for torture and imprisonment were mainly the low 
  caste persons. Among the latter are: Sivapragasam (Valalai Vigilance Committee) 
  and Poologasingham &amp; Konjukkili, both from the Palaly Vigilance Committee.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;In the case of the high castes, some friend 
  or relative close to the LTTE would have approached the leadership and have 
  convinced them that these persons if released could perform some useful services. 
  This would very rarely be the case with the low castes. Further light is thrown 
  on this if we look at how the LTTE, which owes much of its character to the 
  untypical enclave of Valvettithurai, has grafted itself onto the main body of 
  Jaffna society through a developing symbiosis. As a result the institution of 
  caste, under challenge over the two decades leading up to 1985, has since been 
  strengthened all but in name. This was looked at more closely&nbsp; in the previous 
  chapter.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;If one looks at the prisoners mentioned in 
  our reports, which may not be far from a random sample, the figure of 9O% of 
  the prisoners being low caste would not appear to be far off the mark, although 
  about 7O% of Jaffna is high caste. (It was much lower a hundred years ago. Educational 
  advancement can sometimes work wonders with caste). Curiously, the same also 
  holds for the rank and file cadre, fighting, dying and torturing for their leaders.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Many of our cases also show the brutal treatment 
  accorded to prisoners from the low castes even when they are rather old. No 
  restraint operates in the case of such prisoners. The image of `reasonableness' 
  is important for the LTTE in its dealings with dominant sections of Jaffna society. 
  The notion of a low caste person striking a high caste is anathema.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;A case reported to us by a person who recently 
  left the LTTE&nbsp; concerns low caste farmer from Karaveddy, Vadamaratchi. 
  The LTTE was given information that he had supplied food to the EPRLF during 
  the time of the provincial administration. Our interlocutor was in the party 
  that went to question him. The farmer was in the field. Speaking to his wife 
  and children, our interlocutor received the strong impression that the farmer 
  may have supplied food on about one occasion, almost under duress. The farmer 
  on returning was taken away. Under torture he made fantastic admissions. Our 
  interlocutor later asked him why he gave such a different story to the one given 
  earlier. The farmer replied that he could not take the torture. Shortly afterwards 
  the farmer was beaten to death.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;It is very untypical for a high caste to 
  be so treated for a routine offence. Also, with a useful Valvettithurai connection, 
  much can be forgiven, as has happened in practice.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Another important reason for the predominance 
  of low castes among prisoners is closely tied up with the history of the liberation 
  struggle. From the mid 6Os the low castes were politicised en masse by Left 
  organisations and were mobilised against the practice of untouchability. The 
  high castes largely swallowed Tamil nationalist slogans uncritically and were 
  relatively un politicised. Groups like the EPRLF which professed Marxist leanings 
  and universal revolution, in the early stages appealed to sections which were 
  politicised. Even after it became militarised to compete with the LTTE, the 
  EPRLF recruited heavily in these areas. Being poorer, these recruits lacked 
  the ability to flee as their organisation collapsed in the wake of an LTTE takeover.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The group PLOTE had a base in high caste 
  areas of Jaffna. By comparison its cadre had the ability to go abroad and their 
  families were not as threatened by staying at home.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Because of this history, although the LTTE 
  has of late successfully recruited heavily in low caste areas, as an institution 
  it retains a paranoia and a secret fear of areas where Left politics once had 
  a base. Consequently arrests in areas like Vathiri in Karaveddy have had the 
  character of mass arrests [</span> <a
href="../Report6/Report6.htm">Report No.6</a> <span
style='color:#990000'>]. But arrests of members of the higher starta of society 
  have been mostly individual arrests. Our next case illustrates the dilemma facing 
  families that were once part of the Left struggle.</span> <span style='color:#990000'><a href="#_Toc515974205">[Top]</a></span></p>
<h3><a name="_Toc515974214">4.9. The Deserting Recruit</a> </h3>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the following story, the 
  names and incidental details have been changed. Nathan was a typical man of 
  his village. In his younger days he had been active in a Left party, which besides 
  mobilising people against caste oppression had given them considerable knowledge 
  and analysis of liberation struggles around the world. His intellect had been 
  sharpened by the experience of his own social condition. Some success was achieved. 
  As the years went by the party declined. Nathan too married, retained his sympathies 
  and his judgement, but as children came along he busied himself raising his 
  family as a farmer.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Then militant groups came along. Some he 
  more or less agreed with. Others he regarded with horror. In time nearly all 
  of them accepted Indian overlordship and became military institutions. None 
  had a serious programme for the participation of the people. Nathan had a contempt 
  for speech - making. He thus kept a distance from all the groups. As things 
  developed, he saw in the actions of the LTTE everything he had learnt to dread. 
  He knew about Hitler and Stalin and felt in his bones what was going on.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The war of June 199O had begun and Nathan 
  began to worry about his son Ravi. Ravi was backward in his O.Level class. Everything 
  was controlled by the powers that be. For the young there was total emptiness 
  except what the powers offer. All that Ravi saw of the world was what was directed 
  at him through loud speakers and young uniformed boys with automatics running 
  around in vehicles. Ravi grasped at the only visible thing which offered meaning 
  to his dreary existence. Nathan's worst fears came true. Ravi left home and 
  joined the LTTE.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;In his utter despair Nathan found something 
  akin to insanity creeping over him. He sent his wife Kamala to the LTTE camp 
  to bring back Ravi. Kamala was turned away by the LTTE. Kamala told the LTTE 
  leaders that she would fast in front of the camp until Ravi was restored to 
  her. She built herself a shelter in front of the camp and sat down to fast. 
  Some LTTE cadre came out and demolished the shelter. Kamala continued to sit 
  in the open. Eventually Kamala was sent away.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Ravi was recruited into the intelligence 
  unit. After 3 weeks of training Ravi was sent home for two days. On the pretence 

  of attending the some business, Nathan took Ravi to the home of Murugan is a 
  distant village. Nathan then told Ravi that there was no business and that he 
  was taking Ravi to Colombo. Ravi told him that should he not return within 48 
  hours, there will be a search out for him. Nathan told Ravi that unless he agreed 
  to desert, he, Nathan, would swallow insecticide. Leaving Ravi at Murugan's 
  and asking Murugan to use his influence and get a Colombo pass, Nathen went 
  to fetch Kamala.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Soon father, mother and their contrite son 
  set off to the Vavuniya border. To their misfortune the Sri Lankan Forces declared 
  curfew and started a military operation, causing travellers to get held up at 
  Thandikkulam. In the meantime the LTTE had sent out an alert for Ravi and the 
  family was traced to Thandikkulam. The family together with Murugan were detained 
  Nathan swallowed insecticide, but narrowly survived. Nathan was released after 
  treatment. Ravi was taken back into the LTTE.<a href="#_Toc515974205">[Top]</a></span></p>
