  <h2> <font color="#990000"><a name="a"></a>PREFACE</font></h2>
</center>
<blockquote><font color="#990000"></font> <br>
  <font color="#990000">This report makes its appearance at a time when we approach 
  the 10th anniversary of the fateful July of 1983. The current phase of the war 
  is over 2 1/2 years old. The Tamils have no readily identifiable political leadership. 
  Those who promote the LTTE as political leaders do not also feel an obligation 
  to raise issues with them nor demonstrate that they could be influenced to give 
  priority to the welfare of their people. The government's military enterprise 
  is widely talked of as being at a dead end. The political approach based on 
  the parliamentary select committee was handled in the worst possible manner. 
  Instead of a consensus the Tamil parties found themselves bull-dozed towards 
  giving up perceived gains of the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord for what a Tamil SLFP 
  MP described as a `paper rose'. Instead of giving the Tamils the necessary confidence 
  and apply pressure on the LTTE, it tended to strengthen the only plank of Tamil 
  chauvinist politics - that the Sinhalese cannot be trusted. The navy's act of 
  piracy in the Jaffna Lagoon which left more than 35 dead or missing, reinforced 
  some of the worst fears. It must be said here that the Tigers too must be blamed 
  for not allowing the development of any structure to safeguard the interests 
  of civilian travellers and forcing civilians to travel under contrivedly provocative 
  conditions. Even 1O days after the incident the government was `unable to verify 
  the facts', although several of the dead were leading government officials and 
  the informant was the government agent, Killinochchi. Unable to give political 
  leadership, it was once more covering up for the forces. If the hard facts, 
  such as the navy hacking civilians with knives and robbing jewellery from the 
  victims are admitted, an inquiry would be unavoidable.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><font color="#990000">Still, one need not despair of history standing still 
    or repeating itself. Every positive action leaves its mark. We have no doubt 
    that although we may be far from realising the full potential of an international 
    presence,including the ICRC,UNHCR,MSF and others, such a presence has had 
    a benevolent influence. Even with political paralysis at the top, international 
    organisations working closely with well motivated military leadership at local 
    level can greatly improve the general situation in the area. It gives the 
    people greater freedom to articulate their interests, which in turn constrains 
    the Tigers towards greater accountability. Such an outcome is not a victory 
    or a defeat for either side, but a victory for humanity. It is such an outcome 
    that mature leadership ought to aim at, now that we know that talk of a military 
    decision is futile. This is not theory, but is based on recent benign developments 
    in some areas, as isolated and unnoticed as they may be. [See Ch.5]</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><font color="#990000">We have from the beginning (the IPKF days) paid far 
    greater importance to such developments, and have urged action in this direction. 
    Giving precedence to the well-being and dignity of ordinary people,we needed 
    to disagree strongly with Tamil nationalists of various shades for whom the 
    Tamil people did not exist. We increasingly felt that our approach of checking 
    human rights violations by goverment forces while exposing the inhuman depravity 
    of the dominant Tamil nationalist politics,is, in practical terms, the right 
    one. Checking the violations of government forces in the East and bringing 
    greater accountability to the people will go a long way to make it very costly 
    for the Tigers to massacre Muslims and Sinhalese. This would, in both the 
    short term and the long term, be the practical way forward.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><font color="#990000">Another aspect where time has thankfully not stood 
    still is that there is some visible openness in the Southern press in trying 
    to understand what is happening to the Tamil people. There is no total blackout 
    in the independent English press on human rights violations by the forces.Inspite 
    of this, whenever questions of accomodating the minorities arise, undue prominence 
    is given in these papers to individuals with no sense of history. They are 
    unable to grasp the crucial reality of the development of the Sri Lankan state 
    since independence as an essentially Sinhalese state, and the consequent alienation 
    of the minorities. Much credit for the positive developments in reporting 
    should go to some of the smaller Sinhalese papers. Unfortunately there is 
    little openness in the Tamil press, even in some earmarked for that purpose, 
    in examining the legacy of Tamil nationalist politics, and particularly the 
    murder and alienation of Muslims.</font> <br>
    <font color="#990000"></font> <br>
    <font color="#990000">A number of incidents involving LTTE massacres of Muslims 
    have taken place since the publication of Report No.9, the last being on 15th 
    October 1992. In this instance three villages in the Polonnaruwa District 
    populated almost exclusively by Muslims were attacked resulting in 16O civilian 
    deaths. This followed an earlier attack in the same district the previous 
    May. We refer the reader to reports published by the International Centre 
    for Ethnic Studies in Colombo. We will cover aspects of these in coming reports.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><font color="#990000">For the present, high level talks in Colombo may be 
    of little consequence. Where therefore the people are not involved and the 
    electoral map remains fluid, there is little substance in the promises of 
    politicians and `betrayals' will remain the order of the day. With unpromising 
    leadership the deep paralysis brought about by decades of Sinhalese and Tamil 
    chauvinism will take long to thaw. Hence the role of international and non-governmental 
    organisations assumes a disproportionate importance. They must be vigilant 
    against slipping into some kind of paralisis. It is finally a climate of opinion 
    and a desire to act among the people that would move the politicians.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><font color="#990000">In this report we once more highlight the issue of 
    Tamil political prisoners. We have repeatedly raised the matter involving 
    the lives of about 4OOO persons which hang in the balance. Commendable work 
    in exposing this phenomenon has been done by Amnesty International and Article 
    19, and representations have been repeatedly made to the LTTE. Even though 
    this information reached a limited circle, the work mentioned has had a positive 
    influence over the LTTE's thinking on prisoners. Some of the prisoners have 
    been allowed visits by relatives. The LTTE has been trying to improve its 
    image on that score by giving publicity to token releases of prisoners. Much 
    more will be accomplished if concerted publicity is given to the matter and 
    the politics behind it is questioned. If not those in Jaffna and elsewhere 
    trying to raise the matter will continue to face considerable danger. Major 
    news organisations appear to view the matter with some incredulity and are 
    not geared to what would require a greater commitment to human rights rather 
    than routine journalism. That people in Jaffna do not talk about prisoners 
    seems an adequate reason for ignoring the existence of this phenomenon. Will 
    this too be exposed when it is too late for the victims, like the horrors 
    of Nazi concentration camps? This may be unfair to journalists when issues 
    of this kind and the fate of Muslims somtimes come low in the attentions of 
    major humanitarian and religious institutions.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><font color="#990000">The government's poor showing in the desire for a 
    settlement and continuing human rights violations by its forces, appear to 
    have persuaded more expatriates to render `negative' support for the Tigers. 
    These are often persons who would privately admit that the Tigers are `brutal' 
    and `fascist, but also that if the Tigers are weakened now the Tamil people 
    will be `finished'. Indeed while we write this preface,as though to emphasise 
    their point, news came in of 9 civilians killed in Siththankeni, Jaffna, as 
    the result of the airforce bombing a civilian area. We have argued throughout 
    that to say that the Tigers have in any sense protected the Tamils is to take 
    a very blinkered view of events. The only evidence, starting from events in 
    June 199O upto the massacre at Kilaly is that the Tigers deliberately endangered 
    civilians for their own benefit, in the face of brutal state forces.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><font color="#990000">But time has not stood still and there is another 
    stark ground reality. The population of the North-East has declined from about 
    1.7 million in 1987 to about O.9 million today. (5.1 inside). Disease and 
    malnutrition are rife. In 1987 when bombing and shelling in Jaffna was more 
    murderous, people did not flee in such large numbers. Why this situation today? 
    Why such deep rooted disillusionment about our future? Why much of our best 
    potential in underground prisons and foreign climes? What sort of liberation 
    politics is this that tries to excel the government in its oppressiveness?</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><font color="#990000">Even the present population of the North can only 
    decline. Most people have their only capital in terms of the one house giving 
    a roof over their head. They are not allowed to sell this and use the money 
    to move to Colombo. If they leave they lose their house to the Tigers. Thanks 
    to the dedication of individual teachers and university dons, the system of 
    education remains reasonably good at least for the present. Under these conditions 
    it makes practical sense for those with children to let them complete their 
    education in Jaffna, rather than being destitute in Colombo. The Tiger pass 
    system meant to keep people in the North is in many ways superfluous,except 
    to keep children, who are regarded as potential recruits, a captive population. 
    Again a very large number have decided that once their children complete higher 
    education, and are old enough to be on their feet in Colombo or abroad, they 
    will follow them - house or no house. If peace does not reeturn, it is the 
    Mosquito rather than the Tiger that will be master of the land. This is hard 
    reality.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><font color="#990000">If the government is determined to destroy the Tamils 
    in the</font> <br>
    <font color="#990000">North-East, they do not need to waste money on new weapons 
    and aircraft. The president has only to talk peace, do nothing about it, and 
    ask the army to stay put. Tiger politics will do the rest.</font><font color="#990000"></font> 
  <p><font color="#990000">It is important that the Tamils see this for themselves. 
    We have argued that a politics relying on destructive strengths will only 
    destroy the people. The survival of the people of the North-East surely needs 
    a more positive strategy. Our approach of putting human rights first is based 
    on experience and has been sufficiently vindicated.</font> <a href="#a">[Top]</a>
