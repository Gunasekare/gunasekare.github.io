<h3>&nbsp; </h3>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Although there was a feeling among those 
  Muslims who had come across our reports that we were trying to highlight their 
  plight and expose the atrocities meted out to them by the Tamil militant groups, 
  there is disquiet among them regarding certain aspects of our reporting. We 
  have regretted in subsequent reports that some of the things said about Muslims 
  in the East, particularly in <a href="../../SpecialReports/spreport3.htm">Special 
  Report No. 3</a> had been unfair, inaccurate and one- sided in certain aspects. 
  The situation prevailing in the latter half of 199O made it difficult for us 
  to talk to Muslims themselves. We have subsequently tried to make amends. Once 
  again we apologise for our shortcomings and for any injury caused as a result. 
  Within our limitations we try to give out information and analysis in the shortest 
  possible time, so that we could influence current developments and be of service 
  to those whose rights are being violated. It is not our brief to reflect with 
  leisure and erudition on events past which matter little to people in their 
  day to day lives. We will make mistakes, but will be most happy to stand corrected. 
  This has to be an ongoing development and part of a dialogue as well as mutual 
  education.</span> <a href="#_Toc515974832">[Top]</a></p>
<h3><a name="_Toc515974833">A.1.1&nbsp; A reaction from Mannar<span style='color:#990000'>:</span></a> 
</h3>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The following is an extract from a letter 
  sent to us by a Muslim academic: &quot;I am writing this letter to clarify a 
  statement in your recent publication titled &quot;The Trapped People among Peace 
  Makers and War Mongers&quot;.</span> <br>
  <span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;On page 46, under the sub- title&nbsp; 4.1.1 
  The Muslims of Mannar, you state that the Muslims of Mannar Island moved to 
  other areas during the Portuguese and the Dutch periods and that the Muslims 
  had been re-established in the present places during the British era. Further, 
  you state quoting Phillipus Baldeus that Erukallampiddy was not a Muslim village 
  during his time.</span> <br>
  <span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The above statements are historically wrong. 
  The following facts bear evidence to this. There is evidence of the Muslim presence 
  in the Mannar Island and other areas even during the Portuguese and Dutch periods. 
  The Portuguese and the Dutch documents indicate that the Muslims were employed 
  as divers, transporters and elephant catchers during the above two periods. 
  Secondly, the traveller Baldeus, though indicating a church near Erukkalmpiddy, 
  did so in close proximity to present Erukkalampiddy. The local traditions indicate 
  that Erukkalmpiddy village was not occupied by any religious group other than 
  Muslims at anytime in its history. There were churches established by the Portuguese 
  and the Dutch around Erukkallalmpiddy Muslim village (e.g., Sampaturai, St.Jude, 
  etc). Baldeus may have been referring to one of the churches in close proximity 
  to the prominent Muslim settlement Erukkalampiddy.</span> <br>
  <span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;It is very unfortunate that your misleading 
  report carries an account of the history of Mannar Muslims at a time when the 
  LTTE is denying the birthright of the Muslims to live in the Northern Province. 
  In addition, your historical account may be misinterpreted to mean that the 
  present Mannar district Muslims are new comers to the region. You probably know 
  that the history of the Muslims of the Northern Province has not been written 
  so far and your account may be taken as based on facts by uninformed people&quot;</span> 
</p>
<p><b><span style='color:#990000'>Note:</span></b> <br>
  <span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;We are sure that the reader is better informed 
  about Mannar's past than we are. What we made was only a suggestion that the 
  Muslims may have responded particularly to Portuguese persecution by moving 
  to safer areas. We have been clear that any community which is displaced from 
  its home for reasons of insecurity, whether Palestinian, Muslim, Tamil or Sinhalese 
  does not lose its right to the land. We have been clear that the historical 
  claims of Muslims in Mannar are not in any way inferior to those of others in 
  region.As for historical detail, we stand corrected.</span> <a href="#_Toc515974832">[Top]</a></p>
<h3><a name="_Toc515974834">A.1.2 A reaction from Sammanthurai</a> </h3>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;A group of Muslim citizens from Sammanturai 
  in the Amparai District has published a book in Tamil with the title &quot;Another 
  corner of Eelam&quot;. The book gives both historical detail and reflects the 
  Muslim feeling of alienation resulting from the misdirection of the Tamil struggle. 
  It also brings out the little known fact that 132 Sammanthurai Muslims were 
  killed by the various Tamil militant groups up to August 1991. The book also 
  answers inaccuracies from <a href="../../SpecialReports/spreport3.htm">Special 
  Report No.3</a>. It is a welcome book excellently written with moderation by 
  people with a deeply felt desire for reconciliation and peaceful co-existence 
  with their Tamil brethren. The book is a contribution from the people- in the 
  long run more important than the juggling of politicians in Colombo high society.</span> 
  <br>
  <span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;We give below an extract from the preface 
  and will follow it up in future reports. The book is obtainable from the Publications 
  Bureau, Jumma Mosque, Sammanthurai, Sri Lanka. Title: &quot;Eelaththil Innumoru 
  Moolai&quot;.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The preface begins by pointing out that Sammanthurai 

  was a fertile area where the Muslim majority and Tamils, mainly from the service 
  castes,lived in peace for centuries. The communalism of the state gave rise 
  to the Tamil liberation struggle. Not only did the Muslims support the aspirations 
  of the struggle materially and by providing safe places for militants on the 
  run, but Muslim youths too joined the militant groups.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The preface then proceeds: &quot;.... As 
  though an evil eye was cast on fraternal relations between Tamils and Muslims, 
  a contrary development took shape in the late 8Os. The guns of Tamil youth which 
  were trained on banks, government establishments, co-operatives, the police, 
  army and the STF turned their barrels towards Muslim shops, educational institutions, 
  social workers, Muslim intellectuals, responsible social leaders, high officials, 
  innocent civilians and farmers. The Muslims were left powerless and prostrated 
  in the face of these &quot;liberation activities&quot;. Tamil youths carrying 
  sophisticated weapons, the partiality of the IPKF, and later the LTTE&nbsp; 
  looking the other way in a bid to win support from local Tamils, are the main 
  reasons for this. Further, local elders and religious leaders made a conscious 
  decision to urge restraint on the part of Muslims. However the unfortunate events 
  of 17th May l989 and again 23rd July 1991, when Muslims had to run away from 
  their homes into refugee camps were carefully contrived and executed.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;&quot;On the other hand local and foreign 
  information networks , international terrorist agents and those in authority 
  who give them a voice, together with ` European' Human Rights activists have 
  in the name of` reports' spread mythical legends in this country, India and 
  Western Europe. These have represented Muslims as murderers, informers, bandits 
  and religious fanatics.More than all these, the Amparai District report( Special 
  NO.3) of the UTHR (JAFFNA), where it concerns Muslims, has the appearance of 
  being both subjective and far from the truth. Like a bull trampling over one 
  fallen from a tree, this international propaganda document which represents 
  the victim as the oppressor, leaves us in a state of deep shock. Who are these 
  international propagandists? We who are left wondering in anguish as to how 
  do we contact them and explain our true position are not approached any anyone.</span> 

</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;&quot;We have therefore been driven to bring 
  out the truth in a publication in our defence.... In a search for a future of 
  friendship and amity,we place this report before you with an open heart and 
  without ulterior motives. It represents the tragic history of a community that 
  has faced needless loss of life and has been driven to penury.</span> <br>
  <span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;&quot;This is not intended to be merely the 
  saga of a people. But it is meant to lay the foundation for an ongoing dialogue 
  that will bring about the rebirth of a new fraternal relationship...&quot;</span> 
  <br>
  <span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Towards the end of the book it says after 
  condemning the unfair propaganda against Sammanthurai Muslims : &quot; Again 
  we must defend every community and isolate the forces of evil. Each community 
  must respect the other and protect and establish the other's communal, cultural 
  and religious rights.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;&quot;Only thus can our fraternal relationship 
  be re-established. Each community instead of thinking about revenge must count 
  their memories&nbsp; of friendship and gratitude. We cannot continue to live 
  in the same house and break our common wall...&quot;</span> <a href="#_Toc515974832">[Top]</a></p>
