<h3> <br>
  <a name="_Toc515974514">5.1 General</a> </h3>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Addressing a public seminar in Colombo in 
  December, <b>Dr.Nithyanandan</b> of the Department of Economics, University 
  of Jaffna, gave the following figures giving an indication&nbsp; of what is 
  happening to the people:</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Population of the North - East down to 900 
  000 from 1.7 million in 1987, out of whom 50 000 have been killed or missing. 
  (since 1983 ?) of those who had left the region 30 000 Tamils had gone to the 
  West and 20 000 to India. 350 000 are&nbsp;&nbsp; in refugee camps through out 
  the island or were staying with relatives.The number who lost employment in 
  Jaffna District alone are well over 100 000 [Sunday Times 13th December 1992].</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp; These estimates may differ from those given 
  by others. But all figures are of the same order. NGOs in the region give long 
  term indicators of health which are more frightening. It is the growth of public 
  health care that made a considerable expansion in the population of the North 
  - East possible. With poor food and poor preventive health care , the best that 
  could be done is to administer drugs, which too are not always accessible. Malaria 
  and para-typhoid have almost become endemic in Jaffna itself. It is much worse 
  for those in the jungle areas of the North. At the UNCHR camps around Madhu 
  sustaining about 30000 refugees, there is an 80% incidence of malaria. Many 
  have to live with it as drugs have ceased to have an effect.</span> <br>
  <span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;In normal times Mannar hospital had 3 MLTs 
  (Medical Laboratory Technicians). Anyone taken ill in the mainland region was 
  quickly rushed to the hospital by public transport.Tests for malaria were immediately 
  performed and a cure administered. Now there is only 1 MLT who is often away 
  to be with his family. Also transport except by bicycle and boat is almost non-existence.&nbsp; 
  With so many unemployed and even middle class mothers undernourished and infant 
  food priced high, one could imagine the plight of infants.The young generation 
  in its formative years is growing up with severe handicaps.</span><span style='color:#990000'><a href="#_Toc515974513">[Top]</a></span> 
</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc515974515">5.2 Mannar</a> </h3>
<p><b><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>5.2.1 Security</span></b><span style='color:#990000'>:</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp; At one level the situation of the island 
  itself has an appearance of normality. The Muslim residents sent out by the 
  LTTE are coming back. People do not feel tense about the presence of security 
  forces. The police have been busy organising a series of sporting tournaments 
  ( cricket, football etc) where local teams played those from the different forces 
  and came on top. Christmas and New Year were celebrated with fireworks and public 
  dramas. All this is much in the spirit of enjoy today while it lasts. Beneath, 
  there is a deep seated anxiety. People still fear travelling on lonely roads. 
  The security forces still have power over life and death. The society is very 
  hierarchical. The local army brigadier is addressed as 'Sir' even by top government 
  officials.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;On Mannar Island itself there have been no 
  arrests since about August 1992. In the army controlled areas including parts 
  of the mainland, according to leading persons in Mannar, the lists of persons 
  detained in recent months with local organisations generally tally with those 
  admitted by the army. The procedure for questioning and release too is said 
  to be much faster - 3 weeks at the most unless sent to Magazine prison in Colombo. 
  The discrepancies could sometimes arise because when the army advances, some 
  remain within the army controlled area, while others flee into the interior.</span> 
  <br>
  <span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;One person to whom credit is given for the 
  general improvement is Brigadier Sarath Perera, who was in charge of Mannar 
  for about the second half of 1992.&nbsp; Given the previous record of the&nbsp; 
  army in Mannar, the improvement is creditable (See <a
href="chapter4.htm">Chapter 4</a>). Knowing the instincts of Sri Lankan forces 
  an improvement cannot result from the brigadier acting merely as a post box 
  between citizens' organisations, the ICRC and other NGO's, and his own subordinates.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Recent military advances in the area have 
  paid heed to the welfare of civilians. This may also be the result of other 
  calculations.There may be military and political reasons for the government 
  wanting civilians to remain in areas brought under government control rather 
  than drive them into the interior and to the UNCHR camp at Madhu. Further,the 
  LTTE is thinly spread out and the usual practice of bombing and shelling before 
  an advance results in the civilians fleeing the area and the LTTE having advance 
  warning to resist. Many recent advances have taken place by stealth, the civilians 
  coming to know about it only once the army is there.</span> <br>
  <span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Following a recent army advance into Suriya 
  Kaddaikaku&nbsp; near Nanaddan, the local civilians gave much credit to Major 
  Wickrematilleke who was in charge. There were no casualties or arrests.For three 
  days the civilians were asked to lock up their houses, spend the night in a 
  local school and return during the day. There was no looting at all.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;In Puthukaman on the other had there was 
  considerable looting and much damage to agriculture by the movement of heavy 
  vehicles,but no casualties. Over 40 men and youths were taken to Thallady camp, 
  given a lecture, brought back and released. From January 1993 Brigadier Karunatilleke&nbsp; 
  of the Armoured Brigade took charge of Mannar. He had earned himself notoriety 
  during the early days of the current war (after June 1990) when he was posted 
  to Valaichenai. Troops under him were noted for much cruelty and killing besides 
  recruiting for the LTTE. Those then at the Eastern University found him almost 
  totally unsympathetic and difficult to communicate with.It is left to be seen 
  what will happen in Mannar. On the other hand Brigadier Siri Peiris, who was 
  poorly thought of in Mannar seems to have improved his reputation after being 
  posted to Trincomalee in early 1991. The indications seem to be that an attempt 
  will be made to reopen the Mannar - Madawachchi Road. But observers are sceptical.</span> 
  <span style='color:#990000'><a href="#_Toc515974513">[Top]</a></span> </p>
<h3><a name="_Toc515974516">5.2.2 Refugees</a> </h3>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;In a district where more than 8O% became 
  refugees, people are anxious to re- establish themselves and resume normal living.Many 
  who were sent back from India see little prospect of returning to the mainland 
  in the near future and live in refugee camps in Pesalai and Sunny Village. Many 
  of the expelled Muslims with government employment have returned to Mannar Island. 
  Others too are coming back amidst many uncertainties.&nbsp; Towards the end 
  of December two Muslim fishermen who set out from Erukkalampiddy lost themselves 
  in bad - weather, ran out of fuel and went shore on the mainland near Vidathal 
  Thivu. The local folk were afraid to offer them fuel. The two fishermen it is 
  reported, surrendered to the local Roman Catholic parson. the latter contacted 
  the LTTE and pleaded for their safe conduct. The two fishermen were taken away 

  by the LTTE and their fate is not known. It is believed that the likely outcome 
  would be a ransom demand. It is notable that no concerted attempt has so far 
  been made by the LTTE to disrupt Muslim life on Mannar Island.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Tamil refugees are being encouraged to go 
  back to areas brought under army control. Several Vankali refugees returned 
  at the end of December. Many of them got back to Sunny village after finding 
  their houses either destroyed or beyond repair.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Given the total absence of building materials 
  , resettlement becomes merely a paper exercise. All received Rs 2000/-from the 
  government as a resettlement allowance after which they are considered resettled. 
  A further payment of Rs 4000/- is given to applicants for loss of trade upon 
  certification by the GS. This is meant to purchase implements of trade. Many 
  collected this in ignorance not knowing that after collecting this, they would 
  cease to receive food rations. For a mason with a family of 5 food rations are 
  worth Rs1000/- or so a month. With the Rs4000/-grant he could buy tools. But 
  without building materials there is no work. The Rs 15000/- allocated for those 
  whose dwellings were seriously damaged is unrealiseable since there are bo building 
  materials. The system does not work very well in providing relief. There are 
  war widows with children who did not receive any thing more than the first Rs2000/-. 
  But those with no losses could receive advice from a well - disposed GS on how 
  to benefit from all schemes.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The UNHCR's `open relief centres' at Pesali 
  and Madhu have functioned with the flag of the UNHCR, but as far as people could 
  make out , not much more from the UNHCR besides bringing in supplies. The neutrality 
  of these zones was largely ignored by both sides. During 1990 and 91 the army 
  took away people from Pesali, some still not accounted for. The LTTE carried 
  out an execution in Pesali in January 1992. Madhu has been virtually under LTTE 
  control. The current UNHCR representative in the area, a lady with an MSF background, 
  it is reported, is taking a strong line on the neutrality of UNHCR centres. 
  According to press reports, talks with the LTTE are deadlocked. Will the LTTE 
  promote a more pliable alternative to the UNHCR?</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;A key problem confronting those in areas 
  of the mainland recently taken over by the army is the near absence of government 
  services and medical facilities. A number of families have been separated by 
  recent army advances. Both sides want families to reunite in their area.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The army fears that those going to Mannar 
  Island may take another boat to Vidathal Theevu into the Tiger controlled area. 
  Thus those needing to go to Mannar Island for medical attention need to apply 
  to army officers for permits, the latter being mostly ignorant of medical matters.</span>

<h3><a name="_Toc515974517">5.2.3 The Vankalai mystery</a> </h3>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The following item appeared in the Daily 
  News of 06th January:</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Six human skulls, skeletons found in abandoned 
  well</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp; Mannar police found six human skulls and 
  some skeletons and bones in abandoned well in the area, on a tip off by a person 
  who had felt a foul odour emanating from the well while he was trying to clean 
  it.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp; Police believe that these bodies are those 
  of victims of some mysterious killing and that the victims may have been blindfolded 
  and shot in the head and dumped into the well by the culprits.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp; Three national identity cards belonging 
  to Anthonipillai Sebamalai, a school principal , Justin Lambert of Wankalai, 
  Sebamalai Anthony of Murunkan and Kandiah alias Kuruvi Kandiah of Virichchanmandi 
  were also found in the well. Police are trying to ascertain whether the identity 
  cards too belonged to any of the victims.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Further investigations are continuing.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The police need not go to Scotland Yard to 
  solve this mystery. Vankalai is perhaps the most influential village in Mannar. 
  A large number of senior government servants and policemen received their education 
  at St.Anne's, Vankalai. Just ask any one of them!. A report of the incident 
  appeared in Chapter 4 of UTHR(J) <a href="../Report9/Report9.htm">Report No.9</a>. 
  The victims were certainly killed by the army. It was then thought that there 
  were only 4 bodies in the well. Some of those killed were carrying their jewellery. 
  It was not clear whether the motive was robbery or because Principal Sebamalai's 
  school was in a Tiger controlled area. The well was covered up after the matter 
  was reported to the church and UNHCR authorities in Madhu (early l991) by a 
  passerby who saw an injured victim crying for help. Brigadier Srilal Weerasooriya 
  then in charge at Thallady when contacted by local civilians, stated that he 
  could proceed no further as the field officer, Major Dias, was unaware of the 
  incident!</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The well was excavated by relatives following 
  mediation by the ICRC when civilians returned to Vankali on 28th December l992. 
  The story also illustrates that many little known persons disappeared during 
  the course of travel whose stories have gone unrecorded. Their relatives were 
  left to live out their grief in some unknown corner. Will the police or the 
  presidential task force investigate the incident?</span> <span style='color:#990000'><a href="#_Toc515974513">[Top]</a></span></p>
<h3><a name="_Toc515974518">5.3 Coconuts and the fate of the North -East</a> </h3>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The fate of coconut production is a reflection 
  of what is happening to the people and the economy of the North-East. In Batticaloa, 
  local citizens talked to the brigadier about a large number of coconut trees 
  being chopped down by the army. The Brigadier replied that he sympathised with 
  the people. He added that the defence ministry had promised them concrete posts 
  to build defences for their camps. But these never came (IMF restrictions?). 
  Hence the unfortunate chopping of coconut trees.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The Tigers have been using some of the coconut 
  plantations in the sparsely populated areas of Thenmaratchi (Jaffna Peninsula) 
  for their prison camps and ordnance depots. Some months ago a community of toddy 
  tappers who held an estate on contract was told by the Tigers that they had 
  to cease work as the land was being taken over for the Eelam struggle. The tappers 
  pleaded that this was their sole livelihood. The Tigers gave them a month's 
  extension and promised to re-examine the matter. When the tappers returned the 
  following morning to collect the toddy, they discovered that the clay pots in 
  which toddy was collected had been systematically smashed. The tappers joined 
  the army of their unemployed fellows to live on government rations.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;In the Mannar District the widespread destruction 
  of coconut trees is evidence near army camps along the coast. On the island 
  itself the story is different. Mannar Island used to export coconuts. When the 
  war broke out and exports ceased, the price of a coconut dropped from Rs4/- 
  to about Rs 2/-. After the army entered Mannar Island in November l99O, they 
  were initially cautious, As time went and they felt safe, they went about plucking 
  coconuts. By doing this they were able to pocket their coconut allowance. These 
  nuts were used extensively in cooking. Later the soldiers became even more reckless 
  and not even the young coconuts were spared. These were used for drinking (a 
  natural soft drink). Now Mannar Island imports coconuts, a coconut now costing 
  Rs 15/- or more.</span> <span style='color:#990000'><a href="#_Toc515974513">[Top]</a></span></p>
<h3><a name="_Toc515974519">5.4 Wanni: The people and the Tigers</a> </h3>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The people in the Wanni region bordering 
  on Mullaithvu, Killinochchi, Vavuniya and Mannar were most assiduously cultivated 
  by the Tigers in early 199O. From the early days of the struggle these people, 
  hard working peasants most ill-treated by the Sri Lankan army, formed the backbone 
  of the militancy in the North. The Jaffna man could think of going West.But 
  these people were with their backs to the wall. Mahattaya understood this. With 
  the uprooting of the PLOTE it was thought that these people were solidly behind 
  the LTTE. The pattern is by no means uniform. In areas where army discipline 
  has shown a marked improvement, the people have often displayed a capacity for 
  independence.In such areas the Tigers have also become more circumspect about 
  imposing themselves on the people. In one such area the Tigers forced everyone 
  in a village to join a procession for a fallen hero. According to witnesses 
  the young boys in the latter teens were openly cracking sarcastic jokes about 
  the LTTE. The LTTE's grip was mainly on those very young and the older folk 
  with interests of personal gain.The Tigers are often viewed as a group looking 
  for every opportunity to grab money and gold, caring little about any- thing 
  else.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;In such areas, where fear has declined, the 
  Tigers have stopped conscripting people for forced labour in their civil works, 
  such as road building. These are now often given out on contract.</span> <br>
  <span style='color:#990000'>These patterns also illustrate that the appeal of 
  the Tigers in rural areas is not based on positive qualities. It is rather a 
  negative appeal based on the oppressiveness of the Sri Lankan forces.</span> 
</p>
<p><b><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>5.4.1 Executions in the Wanni: Monday, 6th 
  July 1992. An eye- witness account</span><span
style='color:#990000'>.</span></b> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;&quot;About 6.OO A.M travellers going south 
  to Vavunia queued up at Peikulam. Until 7.3O A.M no one was allowed to move. 
  Someone remarked, 'We may not be allowed to go today. At 8.15 two Tigers in 
  mufti arrived and ordered the entire crowd of several thousand to go back northwards. 
  A little further north the crowd was made to sit in a clearing on the right 
  of the road, with no idea of what was going on. At 9.3O A.M an LTTE man appeared, 
  silenced the crowd and began speaking: &quot; Today when our liberation struggle 
  has reached soaring heights, some traitors and anti-social elements are labouring 
  to weaken our struggle. We have apprehended many traitors who live on our soil 
  and clandestinely work against the people. During the last two weeks, on examining 
  letters carried by travellers, we have discovered several secret messages together 
  with information being passed on to traitors living outside Tamil Eelam. In 
  the past our struggle had endured great losses because of sabotage by traitors 
  and anti - social groups. Therefore, you the peoplle must help us to identify 
  the traitors&quot;.</span> <br>
  <span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;&quot; While the speech was being made, a 
  covered Elf van made its appearance. First, two women, blindfolded and hands 
  tied behind, were unloaded. This was followed by the unloading of 8 men in a 
  similar state. The women were aged bout 35 and with the exception of 3, all 
  the men were young. We then understood that these persons were traitors and 
  were going to be shown to us. We were eager to see their faces. They were made 
  to stand in a row 1O -15 yards to the south of us.At this point a Pajero jeep 
  arrived. A slightly obese man in mufti and a further 5 persons descended from 
  the jeep. The crowd whispered, `Mahattaya, Mahattaya'.Six persons had come with 
  the traitors in the Elf van who had a frightening visage. Although two were 
  huge, the smaller ones were no less daunting. They wore black arm bands on the 
  left hand , and not a hint of a smile escaped their faces.They positioned themselves 
  15 yards in front of the traitors, weapons ready.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;&quot;The first speaker resumed his harangue: 
  &quot; These ten for the crime of having worked against the struggle have been 
  sentenced to death. These, shame on them, for a sum of Rs 1000/-(US $ 25) and 
  a bottle of arrack (distilled fermented coconut toddy) have passed on information 
  to our enemies. They will now confess their sins&quot;. All the traitors began 
  saying that they had given information to the government and that they accept 
  the just and fair punishment. Two broke ranks and screamed aloud,&quot; We are 
  innocent, We admitted the charges only because we could not bear the torture. 
  Please forgive us!&quot;Immediately, the order &quot;Fire&quot; rang out ,followed 
  by gun shots. The women in audience screamed. &quot;Aiyo! Kadavule!'(Oh God!). 
  Many bowed their heads. A cold sensation crept over my body.The victims fell 
  to the earth screaming and gave up the ghost. Two of the executioners walked 
  towards the dead and examined their bodies. One of them pulled out a huge baynet, 
  severed the head of one of the dead.He&nbsp; lifted the head by the hair and 
  displayed it to the people. He then said,&quot; The army sent him here to spy 
  on us. We will now return his head to the army&quot;. The women and the elderly 
  travellers started shivering. My hands and feet became numb.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;&quot; The first speaker then said, &quot; 
  You can not go to Vaunniya today. Come tomorrow. You can all go!&quot; Many 
  stood up and went to view the corpses. I could not walk. I later returned to 
  Killinochchi. Unable to eat nor sleep, I guzzled a bottle of arrack which helped 
  me to drown my senses in a drunken doze. Resuming my journey on the 9th , I 
  heard many in the queue speaking about the incident.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;&quot; I gathered that the Tigers had parcelled 
  the head and had forced a traveller to leave it near the Thandikulam army sentry 
  point. The army had later forced a lady going north to leave her bags, take 
  the parcel to Tiger sentry point and return for her bags.</span> <br>
  <span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;&quot;On the 6th three&nbsp; lady medical 
  students from the University of Jaffna had been in the crowd. On sensing what 
  was going to happen, the students began to leave. At the back of the crowd a 
  Tiger stopped them, asked where they were going and asked for their identity 
  cards. On discovering who they were, he said,&quot; You want to be doctors and 
  need to cut up people. So you are afraid of blood? You are the ones who must 
  watch&quot;. The three ladies almost in tears pleaded,&quot; We are scared. 
  We want to go&quot;. They were allowed to leave. Hardly had they walked&nbsp; 
  3OO yards when they heard the gunfire.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;&quot;I later heard that the man whose head 
  was severed was the driver of the former Vauniya UNP organizer Pulendran, who 
  was shot dead about 198O. He had then worked as a lorry driver and was detained 
  by the Tigers at Viswa Madshu&quot;.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Other observers in the Wanni point out that 
  this show was put on by Mahattaya at a time when his authority within the Movement 
  was increasingly the subject of speculation. They think that the event involves 
  a strong element of internal LTTE politics. Mahattaya, according to reliable 
  reports, has now been delegated to do rehabilitation and refugee work.One reason 
  for the demotion, it is said, is a complaint that he was interfering too much 
  with the work of the intelligence unit!</span> &nbsp; <span style='color:#990000'><a href="#_Toc515974513">[Top]</a></span></p>

<p><span></span>Pathinathar Santiapillai was a resident of St. Mary's Street, 
  Navanthurai, Jaffna. He was arrested by the LTTE in early 199O and is known 
  to have been tortured. On Saturday 19th December l992 the LTTE informed Pathinathar's 
  wife that her husband had been executed. The reason given was that he was supposedly 
  the supporter of another militant group. The deceased leaves behind 3 children. 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp; About l986, the Tigers had difficulties 
  in the fishing village of Navanthurai. During the disturbances the Tigers shot 
  dead Pathinathar Visian. It is noteworthy that Pathinathar Santialpillai was 
  his brother. In many cases the Tigers have been known to wait several years 
  for an opportunity to move against a marked person.</span> <span style='color:#990000'><a href="#_Toc515974513">[Top]</a></span></p>
<h3><a name="_Toc515974522">5.5.4</a></h3>
<p><b><span></span></b><span style='color:#990000'>Ganeshasunderam, Chelliah 
  and Ganeshan worked for the People's Bank in Jaffna. The first was a senior 
  manager, the second, manager of the New Market Branch and the last a security 
  officer. All three were detained by the LTTE in early 199O. Ganeshasunderam 
  was among the foremost citizens of Jaffna, a member of several elite gatherings 
  and former president of the St.John's OBA, St.John's being Jaffna's elite school. 
  He was little different from his friends, friendly and given to conviviality 
  with old buddies. No one got the impression from his conversations that he was 
  in any way opposed to the Tigers.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;His arrest naturally led to a great deal 
  to consternation among his many friends and private representations were made.The 
  LTTE never directly made a single allegation against him. Rather , rumours were 
  circulated to the effect that he had entertained Indian officers and had passed 
  on information to them.It was not unusual during the IPKF presence for Indian 
  officers to visit leading citizens. The LTTE had lightly let off several members 
  of the elite who had been thrust into positions of intimacy with the IPKF and 
  who even served on vigilance committees appointed by the IPKF. Many of these 
  persons had no qualms about performing the same services for the LTTE or anyone 
  else in power. That Ganeshasuderam dealt with the IPKF in the course of his 
  duties or that IPKF officers sometimes called on him, as they did on many others, 
  was not in any way a serious charge even where the LTTE was concerned. But the 
  rumours circulated about him mainly served to silence those who may press for 
  his release.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The story becomes even more curious when 
  one goes into the circumstances of Ganeshasundarsm's arrest. It becomes clear 
  that Ganeshsundaram had no idea that the LTTE had anything against him. He had 
  been transferred to Colombo as a manager in late 1989 and he visited Jaffna 
  regularly to see his family and attend to residual matters in his previous posting.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;On a visit to Jaffna in March 199O after 
  the LTTE had taken control, there was a message at his home asking him to call 
  briefly at the LTTE office in Nallur. He went in good faith, thinking that it 
  was to iron out a small problem and that he could finish this and return to 
  Colombo.On the first day he was told at the camp that the man who had summoned 
  him was not there. The same thing happened on the second day. Each day he went 
  back home and returned the following day.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;On the third day it was said that he would 
  be questioned and released in a few hours. He was never released. According 
  to several sources, Ganeshasundaram is now dead - presumably killed as a 'Traitor. 
  His associates in Jaffna, according to these sources were prevented from publishing 
  an obituary for him , even with whatever charge made by the LTTE. But there 
  were no charges.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;It is very uncommon for the LTTE to be so 
  harsh with a member of the elite. To this class the LTTE tries hard to put on 
  a 'reasonable' and amicable face. To solve the mystery, one seems to have to 
  look for something that is inoffensive to ordinary people, but deeply offensive 
  to the LTTE. The solution seems to lie in the fact that two other colleagues 
  of Ganeshasunderam were taken in. Rumours merely suggested that they had 'given 
  information'. The security officer used to operate a radio communication set 
  to communicate with the head office in Colombo. many members of the public sought 
  the People's Bank's help to pass on urgent private messages to Colombo- marriages, 
  funerals etc. Although it may naively look plausible, it is silly to suggest 
  that the radio was used to `pass information'. Radio messages are easily and 
  routinely tapped. The IPKF was on the other had only a few yards away and called 
  in regularly. It then appears that the LTTE's concern is not with Ganeshasundaram 
  personally, but with some action of the People's Bank.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Bank sources suspect that the answer is `Gold'. 
  People's Bank was the only bank that accepted pawned jewellery and gold as security 
  for loans to farmers and other tradesmen. As the security situation in Jaffna 
  deteriorated from 1985, the gold in People's Bank, Jaffna was transferred to 
  the head office vaults in Colombo. This greatly inconvenienced local people 
  who had then to go to Colombo to retrieve their jewellery. Once the IPKF established 
  control in Jaffna and agreed to provide security for institutions, the gold 
  was brought back to Jaffna in 1988. When Ganeshsundaram was transferred to Colombo 
  in 1989, there was no one in Jaffna to accept responsibility for holding the 
  gold in Jaffna. Further, the IPKF's days seemed to be numbered. The gold was 
  returned to Colombo with the IPKF&nbsp; providing security from Jaffna to Palaly 
  airport. Ganeshasundram only acted as a dutiful banker looking after his customers. 
  Knowing the LTTE's predilection for gold, the knowledge when it assumed control 
  that gold had been transferred to Colombo would have been a source of irritation. 
  The LTTE's subsequent gold collection campaigns are well known.</span> <br>
  <span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;It also appears that anger against Ganeshasundaram 
  increased as he was questioned. Initially there was no general alert out for 
  him as a traitor or otherwise. Even the deputy in the LTTE camp where he was 
  asked to report was unaware that he was wanted for questioning. If his conscience 
  was not clean when he was asked to come to the camp, he would have simply boarded 
  a train and gone to Colombo.<a href="#_Toc515974513">[Top]</a></span></p>
