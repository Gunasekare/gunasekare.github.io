<h3>&nbsp; </h3>
<h3><a name="_Toc515973852">2.1 Introduction</a> </h3>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Many of our recent reports have averred to 
  detainees being taken by the Sri Lankan Forces - from their homes, removed from 
  public transport while fleeing the war zone, often from refugee camps, while 
  fleeing to India by sea and when sheltering from the war in the South. In <a
href="../Report5/Report5.htm">Report No.5</a> we referred to a press report in 
  the Virakesari where a convoy of buses going to Colombo from Batticaloa escorted 
  by the forces was stopped at the army camp in Valaichenai. Then home guards 
  under army supervision removed about 30 passengers. The incident took place 
  in late August 1990. We also referred (<a
href="../Report7/Report7.htm">Reports 7</a> &amp; <a
href="../Report9/Report9.htm">9</a>) to 16 persons removed from the refugee camp 
  in Pesalai, Mannar Island, by the army in November 1990.<a href="SpReport3\content3.htm"> 
  </a><a
href="../../SpecialReports/spreport3.htm">Special Report No. 3 </a>was written 
  at the time the STF was making mass arrests from refugee camps, a number of 
  whom finished up as headless bodies on the high seas. A number of Tamils in 
  the South continued to be arrested in the South during the course of the current 
  conflict and nothing more has been heard of several of them. Kugamorthy was 
  prominent among them. Representations made among very high circles, including 
  the President's office, bore no fruit.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Some have lived to tell the tale. We now 
  complement accounts given by former detainees in <a
href="../../SpecialReports/spreport3.htm">Special Report No.3</a>&nbsp; and <a
href="../Report7/Report7.htm">Reports 7</a>, <a
href="../Report8/Report8.htm">8</a> and <a
href="../Report9/Report9.htm">9</a> and also shed some light on the specific instances 
  mentioned above. The story still remains far from complete. These experiences 
  also tell us about the perverted notion of legality that has become current 
  in the wake of the PTA and the new emergency regulations. Even when it is evident 
  that the prisoner can have no information of the slightest military value, torture 
  is proceeded with until the prisoner confesses to something, such as giving 
  food parcels to the LTTE, to justify his detention. Those who survived this 
  ordeal have been kept for between one and two years before being released without 
  charges. These considerations are relevant to the question of sending back Tamil 
  refuguees from India and Europe.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;`Maskade' (Butcher's shop) is a term current 
  among detainees of the forces descriptive of the torture chamber. Its Tamil 
  equivalent,`Iraichikkadai', is used by the LTTE's detainees. They remain curious 
  symbols of national unity in a supposedly separatist war.</span> <span style='color:#990000'><a href="#_Toc515973851">[Top]</a></span></p>
<p><b><span style='color:#990000'>The general pattern</span></b> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;As mentioned in earlier repots, between June 
  and October 199O, the Forces made mass arrests in many parts of the East, and 
  the best information we have is that most of them were executed within a few 
  days. The pattern that took shape goes something like this. In the East, the 
  detainees not killed were generally tortured at the local forces' camp for one 
  or two weeks. In the Mannar District, the detainees were usually sent to Thallady 
  Camp if they survived the first day or two. At Thallady, torture followed a 
  fairly uniform pattern (See also Ch. 4,<a href="Report9\content9.htm"> </a><a
href="../Report9/Report9.htm">Report 9</a>) and lasted from one week to three.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Those who survived followed the initiation 
  of the first two to six weeks in the local centres were then sent to Magazine 
  Prison in Colombo. Survivors who were badly mauled and were refused admission 
  by Magazine Prison were sent to the Kadawatte STF camp until sufficiently presentable. 
  In some cases they had a further period of interrogation at the 4th floor CID 
  building in Colombo before being sent to Magazine. Magazine Prison has a routine 
  where prisoners on admission are beaten by guards on the first day - a kind 
  of rag, but not very serious compared to what they had been through. It is called 
  Varavetpadi (Welcoming beating) in prisoners' parlance. Thereafter the prisoners 
  were left in peace and even found the guards friendly and helpful. Those ill 
  at the time of admission escaped Varavetpadi. One prisoner who was earlier at 
  the Military Police camp in Trincomalee said that there was no infliction of 
  physical pain there.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Some prisoners finished the latter stage 
  of their detention at Magazine Prison and others at the detention camp in Kalutura.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Following their release, nearly all prisoners 
  had two or more of the following symptoms: Recurring loss of memory (LM) Recurring 
  blackouts (BO), Nightmares (NM), Gastrits (G), Body pains (BP), Hypertension 
  (HT) Abdominal pains (AP), Tremors of hands (TR), Skin infections like scabies 
  in nearly all cases (SK), Sleeplessness (SL), Loss of appetite (LA), and Frequent 
  ejaculations in the nights (FE). The last, sometimes symptomatic of sexual torture, 
  is something about which prisoners are understandably reticent.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;An observation made by some of the prisoners 
  held at Thallady, is that some prisoners with known LTTE links were released 
  on the intervention of certain leading local figures. Those tortured most often 
  had nothing to confess. Some undercurrents involving intermediaries who smuggle 
  fuel bought from the forces to the North have been touched in<a href="Report9\content9.htm">&nbsp; 
  </a><a
href="../Report9/Report9.htm">Report 9 </a>.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Nearly all those who were questioned have 
  gone back to their homes. To prevent identification, names and certain other 
  details have been suppressed.</span> <span style='color:#990000'><a href="#_Toc515973851">[Top]</a></span></p>

<p><b><span style='color:#990000'>Batticaloa District</span></b> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;4....(20s), Trincomalee. Was in Batticaloa 
  when war broke out in June 1990. Was travelling to Colombo in a bus on 21st 
  August 199O, as part of an army escorted convoy of buses and other vehicles. 
  The convoy was stopped at Ottaimavadi and 29 males and 3 females were picked 
  off buses by home guards under the supervision of the army at Valaichenai. Prisoners 
  were at first assaulted with batons by home guards. (This was done nine days 
  after the massacre of Muslims at Eravar by the LTTE). At the Valaichenai army 
  camp they were placed in sitting positions with hands and feet tied and were 
  assaulted with hands and wire. Three days later, prisoners were taken to the 
  army camp at Punani and were kept in six cells, each 8ft by 4ft, 6 or 7 persons 
  to a cell. There they were tortured almost without break for 14 days. Each time 

  the shift changed, torture commenced with new zeal. At Punani, the prisoner 
  witnessed about 6 others being beaten to death and burnt with tyres soaked in

<p><span style='color:#990000'>Note: Though originally from the same community

  rift between fishermen on both sides of the straits. Fishermen in Mannr Island 
  have been complaining that Indian fishermen intruded into their area, taking 
  their catch and sometimes breaking their nets with their boats. The navy, though 
  ready to show their power in the Jaffna lagoon, have been chary about acting 
  aginst Indian fishermen.</span> </p>

  ministry.&quot;</span> </p>

<h3><a name="_Toc515973854">2.3 Prisoners &amp; International Organisations</a> 
</h3>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The two international organisations with 
  which the prisoners above came into contact are the ICRC in most cases and the 
  UNHCR in several of the cases from Mannar District. We have in our reports recorded 
  the taking of prisoners from refugee camps in all districts of the Eastern Province, 
  a large number of whom were later not accounted for. The same thing has happened 
  in Pesalai, though on a smaller scale, despite a UNHCR presence.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The ICRC has had varying access to detention 
  camps in areas of the North-East with a Sri Lankan Forces' presence. As to whether 
  all or only selected prisoners were seen by the ICRC,the second has usually 
  been the case. We do not have adequate information on the pattern in recent 
  months. What is found in our reports represents the changing pattern up to about 
  a year ago (1991 end).</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Earlier on, certainly, prisoners to be eliminated 
  were not shown to the ICRC. In Mannar the ICRC in general had access to prisoners, 
  not upon arrest, but after the torture session was over. (See also Ch.4,&nbsp;<a href="Report9\content9.htm"> 
  </a><a
href="../Report9/Report9.htm">Report 9 </a>.). This role of the ICRC served a 
  purpose besides adding something to the safety of those already tortured. Those 
  seen by the ICRC could and have given information on others not seen. How effectively 
  such information is used depends much on the local ICRC representatives. Some 
  of the prisoners listed in our reports have the impression that the ICRC was 
  not aggressive enough. Of course, the long term benefits to the prisoners from 
  the ICRC presence depend on its overall institutional character and how the 
  Sri Lankan Forces as an institution respond. This is too large an issue for 
  our limited experience. But in our experience there are notable local variations.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The ICRC in Batticaloa once had a very conscientious 
  lady. As soon as an arrest was reported, she was known to go to the place immediately 
  and remonstrate with the person in charge until some assurance was given. According 
  to sources in Batticaloa, when the local office had a new head, this lady was 
  asked to go slow, to her annoyance. This may be because of a different perception 
  of what was best for the detainees.<a href="#_Toc515973851">[Top]</a></span></p>
