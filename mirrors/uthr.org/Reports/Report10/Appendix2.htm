<h2>&nbsp; </h2>
<p><b><span></span>Dr.Rajani Thiranagama</b><span
style='color:#990000'>, a founder activist of the UTHR (Jaffna) fell victim to 
  the assassin's bullet on 21st September l989. We assess here her lasting contribution 
  and the relevance today of what she stood for, and for which she gave her life.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp; Having identified herself so closely with 
  those thousands who were dying un -numbered in such degrading conditions, it 
  would not have concerned Rajani if no memorial could be erected for her today 
  among the people she served and loved. That those who killed her needed to go 
  in for barbaric repression and lead an entire people into a twilight existence 
  that could barely be termed human, is surely a sign that the memory of those 
  like her is greatly feared by them.</span> <a href="#_Toc515974980">[Top]</a></p>
<h3><a name="_Toc515974981">A 2.1 The Primacy of the People:</a> </h3>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;This forms the key element in the vision 
  bequeathed by Rajani. With her it was not a slogan or merely a sentiment. She 
  recognised that the basis for any benign and lasting change must be rooted in 
  the people. This change together with a realisation by the people their power 
  to chart their destiny required political vision and a practical programme.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;This is not so self evident as it might seem. 
  In fact it is all too easily seen in Sri Lanka that even among the Left leaning 
  elite there is widespread cynicism about the common people. The common people 
  are seen as vile or volatile and moved mainly by manipulation. This picture 
  emerges from a particular reading of Sri Lanka's post independence experience.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Thus whether it is the JVP crisis of l987 
  - 89&nbsp; or the current civil war, leadingg intellectuals have viewed the 
  making of peace as a horse deal between leaders for whom people do not matter. 
  Ordinary people may be suffering abject indignities from the parties in conflict 
  and may be dying their thousands without denting the optimism of peace makers 
  and intellectuals.Even&nbsp; effective political leadership and statesmanship 
  are seen as the ability to present cosmetic remedies for past failures of character 
  and intellect while&nbsp; fooling the people. Thus in the Sri Lankan context 
  the ability to pander to Sinhalese chauvinist sentiment while devolving some 
  power to the Tamils, or to dismantle local checks on economic life&nbsp; to 
  Western dictates of liberalisation while pretending that Sri Lankan culture 
  is being preserved in its pristine glory, are considered virtues in&nbsp; a 
  political leader. But there is no attempt to question the legacy of the past 
  and the constraint this continues to impose on the countrys direction.</span> 

  <br>
  &nbsp; </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;This cynicism about the people has reinforced 
  the view that politics is a crude business to be undertaken by immoral individuals. 
  In turn the people have become more powerless and further degraded, giving further 
  confirmation to the dim view of them. The notion of addressing the people, giving 
  them a sense of power and dignity through mobilising them on the basis of higher 
  human values and accepting the risks of confrontation with the dominant interests 
  is no longer in vogue among intellectuals. They have largely become analysts 
  talking to foreign audiences and elite circles, hardly moved by the immense 
  suffering below which they have come to see as inevitable. While intellectuals 
  have succumbed to various degrees of opportunism and cowardice, the rot goes 
  on apace below, with the progressive brutalization of culture. The chronic responses 
  of a lost people benumbed by oppression and massive death, and the callousness 
  of the authorities, go hand in hand. Bunkered&nbsp; intellectuals wringing their 
  hands peer at the panorama through mental slits.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;In time even the best minds lose their capacity 
  to analyse. One symptom of this is the bizarre notion of peace making that has 
  gained wide currency. Creating conditions of peace is seen as the appropriate 
  sharing of power between those ready to torture and kill rather than empowering 
  the people by creating conditions where they could democratically exercise it. 
  We have thus failed to learn from repeated tragedies.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;It is a sign of the depth of Rajani's commitment 
  to ordinary people, that she was never tempted by comfortable elitist notions. 
  Most of these elites did not see the tragedy of the war with the Indian Peace 
  keeping Force in late 1987 as one that had been in the making through the development 
  of our political culture. They rather saw the problem as one of talking to Indian 
  officials and LTTE leaders, and patching up relations between them. Rajani considered 
  this a waste of time.The issue has never been that both parties did not want 
  to talk to each other or simply that they only wanted to carry on with the war, 
  but rather that both wanted certain things achieved on their own terms. When 
  warring parties have a real contempt for people and do not directly represent 
  their interests,the people rarely come into the picture as factors determining 
  the course of events. She knew that the warring parties would take note only 
  when the people are organised to articulate healthy values and demand their 
  basic rights in no uncertain terms.</span> <br>

  <span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Rajani's response to the crisis of October 
  l987 was to go to the ordinary people, not as a patronising outsider, but as 
  one of them. She opened her home to distressed women and students who found 
  both shelter and counsel. Whether it was the case of a disappeared person, a 
  detained student, the university being importuned by the conflicting parties, 
  or a woman subject of the trauma of rape, Rajani laid stress on a collective 
  approach by students, women or people of the village who were to make a conscious 
  decision to identify with the suffering of the victim. She saw these as small 
  beginnings by which people would realise their power to change their world. 
  She frowned upon individual or class opportunism, and protested vehemently whenever 
  university dons approached their problems as a privileged class. With Rajani 
  political action acquired a new intense meaning, very demanding intellectually 
  and where both the intellect and action enhanced the quality of the other.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Although she attached little importance to 
  talking to those with the guns with the capacity to kill and to manipulate, 
  she took a great deal of time and trouble talking to the alienated young tempted 
  by destructive violence. She was warned by colleagues in strong terms. But through 
  her own past experience she understood the urges of the young and felt for them 
  deeply. She pleaded with them, not to commit their courage and devotion to unscrupulous 
  leaders who would readily destroy them and the community to realise totalitarian 
  power. Rajani's ideas on collective action were making an impact. Several of 
  her friends came to realise the potential of disciplined, self-effacing collective 
  action as distinct from being heroic voices in the wilderness. Her presence 
  was too much for the politics of destruction.</span> <a href="#_Toc515974980">[Top]</a></p>
<h3><a name="_Toc515974982">A 2.2 Rajani's Political Vision:</a> </h3>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The growth of cynicism about ordinary people 
  in Sri Lanka can be traced to the failure of the Left to understand that the 
  mainstream in political life was largely independent of parliament. The development 
  of this mainstream takes place by imperceptible changes in the minds of people 
  - what they accept or reject and how they perceive their interests. Saddled 
  with rigid ideologies taken from mentors abroad, a section of the Left viewed 
  success largely as success at the parliamentary hustings. Their inability to 
  secure the desired parliamentary success turned them to cynicism about the people, 
  opportunism, communalism and compromise as means of gaining power in the early 
  7Os. This largely destroyed the Left and brought parliamentary politics to an 
  all time low. In times when the Left was seen as standing for principles and 
  ideals it had a strong base in the universities, among mature students and the 
  workforce, and thus was very influential in large sections of the rising generation. 
  On the other hand those who opposed parliamentary politics and talked of revolutionary 
  politics had their own dogmatic models and sterile outlook which was neither 
  creative nor meaningful to the vast majority. The suicide of the Left, far advanced 
  in the 7Os, resulted in a dangerous vacuum, particularly because of increasing 
  alienation of the among young.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;In fairness to the very able leaders of the&nbsp; 
  old Left, the success of the Russian revolution of l917 in particular, turned 
  them away from the freshness and open-mindedness of Marx's thought and imposed 
  on them the identification of success with power. Rajani came into a generation 
  where old certainties had wilted and those with a sense of social responsibility 
  had to discover Marx's thought afresh.</span> <br>
  &nbsp; </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Without the presuppositions of ideologies 
  matured abroad, she set about the intellectual labour of seeking the causes 
  of the chronic social and political malignancy in her country in material relations- 
  the historical development of social and economic institutions. In keeping with 
  Marx's maxim, her intellect was sharpened by its application to change the state 
  of affairs. Her intellectual and emotional passion come through in her writings 
  in &quot; The Broken Palmyrah&quot;.</span> </p>

<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;In contrast to those who equated success 
  with power, and in consequence became disillusioned and abandoned the people 
  to demagogues, Rajani had implicit&nbsp; trust in the people. She saw the close 
  connection between the low state of morality and the cynicism and distrust of 
  politics and leaders in general. She knew that if the people found leaders whom 
  they could trust, to demonstrate to them through collective responsible actions 
  that there was an alternative, where they could shed their mental and physical 
  chains in the process of realising dignity and fellowship with justice, they 
  would opt for this with enthusiasm. She understood that try as she may, she 
  was also a prisoner of the current dispensation. Her personal liberation would 
  follow the empowerment of the people. Indeed she was very keenly aware that 
  this had happened elsewhere. She valued the experiences of modern Marxist thinkers, 
  both from the West and from the Third World. Marxism which posed as state ideology 
  has been discredited. Despite notable successes for a time in some major areas 
  such as eliminating mass poverty and perhaps in containing divisive nationalisms, 
  it tended to become totalitarian in nature. But Marx is very much alive , though 
  Marxists do not make headlines.</span> <a href="#_Toc515974980">[Top]</a><br>

<h3><a name="_Toc515974983">A 2.3 Rajani and feminism<span
style='color:#990000'>:</span></a> </h3>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;This was an area which was close to Rajani's 
  heart and where her blossoming as an intellectual and an activist were very 
  evident. She was far from the popular caricatures imposed on the term. She felt 
  deeply for the degradation of women, but also saw in the liberation of women, 
  the liberation of the society as a whole. Here again personal attention and 
  sympathy for victims went hand in hand with analysis.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;She saw, as evident in her writings, a close 
  link between the oppression of women and the rise of a politics with a leader 
  - god, sending thousands of young men and women on&nbsp; a suicidal course in 
  an apparent show of altruism.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The society in Jaffna is also one where there 
  was a powerful drive pushing young men towards material success. In the past 
  it meant joining the professions, and most recently it came to mean going abroad. 
  It's value system is dictated by a very mobile and aspiring middle class which 
  has very short sighted and narrow vision. The vision of possibilities in life 
  was so narrow that failing the O Levels or failing at university entrance could 
  appear to mean the end of the road. Thus the discriminatory move to restrict 
  university places for Tamils in l970, though affecting a small minority, was 
  one of the major turning points in Tamil politics.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Success for women was most often measured 
  as marriage to a &quot;successful&quot; man. A woman who attained this success 
  tended to be jealous of her privileges. A pernicious norm dealing with success 
  was set in accordance with which most women drove their sons. For a young girl 
  money and property bequeathed to her by her parents was the most likely means 
  of advancement. Rich girls were taught to be respectable and the poor to be 
  humble. A young woman bubbling with ideas and enthusiasm to go out onto the 
  world and help others was often broken and consigned to the subservience of 
  a `good' marriage. As everywhere a girl with extra- ordinary intelligence and 
  no means tended to suffer much more than a male. It was a society which disposed 
  women to be the natural enemies of women. The above factors may be common to 
  every other society but the rise of the middle class and its specific nature 
  of dependence for social mobility on a few avenues made the crisis more acute.It 

  was also a society which understandably had one of the highest suicide rates, 
  both men and women, before these troubles.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The material conditions of life affecting 
  the nature of this society are evident. The current Tamil politics instead of 
  liberating people from these constraints, deliberately, conspired with the adversary 
  to tighten them, and draw from its destructive energy. The dormant urge for 
  suicide was given a seemingly altruistic release by the interposition of a religion 
  of sacrifice and a leader- god.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Rajani set about unlocking this prison in 
  order to liberate women. This meant hard systematic effort. Women who had suffered 
  and were rejected were the most likely candidates for this work. Every moment 
  she spent consoling them and opening up new vistas for organised effort was 
  well spent. The social breakdown which made old norms of success unattainable 
  also created opportunities. Death and injury on a mass scale was pushing women 
  into roles of leadership in families. Many of them saw that the whole thing 
  was wrong. This made it important for the political leaders to repress and stamp 
  out any collective effort by women not under their supervision.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;It is clear that the degenerated Tamil politics 
  of today could not have survived liberated womanhood. To claim that mothers 
  consciously give their children to become cannon fodder for this politics is 
  an insult to human and animal motherhood.</span> <br>
  <span style='color:#990000'>Almost every time children were cajoled away by 
  liberators or were taken by the army, mothers spent days trekking from one camp 
  to the other and waiting hours in the sun. There have been recent instances 
  where mothers had spontaneously got together in villages to resist implied demands 
  that each household should give a child for the LTTE's struggle. Rajani has 
  recorded several instances where women of the lower classes had spontaneously 
  got together to stand up to gunmen of every colour.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Rajani has also exposed the true position 
  of women cadre involved in the struggle. Their position is an extension of that 
  of women in society. Women in uniform are often objects to boost the egos of 
  men. Blank faced women in uniform putting on cyanide capsules and shouting their 
  allegiance to, and willingness to die for a macho leader is more reminiscent 
  of some bizarre and ancient temple ritual.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Rajani saw in the natural urges of women, 
  particularly in their role of caring and bringers of life, and in the contradictions 
  they face as a consequences of social breakdown, one of the most potent forces 
  for the liberation of Third World peoples. As Rajani's death demonstrated, providing 
  the necessary organisation is going to be a hazardous task.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Rajani felt that feminism as a theory gave 
  her strength and&nbsp; allowed her to understand other forms of oppression in 
  a more creative way. Her understanding of the difference between biological 
  determinism and biological potential and its implications enabled her to understand&nbsp; 
  human potential and evaluate human nature in a more dynamic manner. On the other 
  hand she was appalled by the sectarianism in women's movements as well as Marxist 
  movements and was always aware of the danger of becoming too important in an 
  elite circle. She understooed the potential for an individual to degenerate 
  as a mere careerist who spends all her or his time in attending conferences 
  and seminars with little real contribution.</span><a href="#_Toc515974980">[Top]</a> 
</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc515974984">A 2.4 The Spiritual and the Material:</a> </h3>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Rajani never diminished the importance of 
  the spiritual. She did not reach any finality on the matter, but felt a sense 
  of awe and wonder about life itself. It would be true to say that like Marx, 
  she did not exalt the material realm with its dull routines. But did hold that 
  the chains in this realm must be broken for the emergence of a humanity with 
  higher aspirations. As such, she felt the task worth undertaking. She valued 
  being lovingly human. She was vehemently against using people as tools. Though 
  tactics were important, these were subject to principles and values she accepted 
  as part of caring humanity and the pre - condition of trust. Trust between people 
  was to be the vehicle for action and not manipulation.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp; During the years that have succeeded her 
  death, the UTHR(Jaffna) and several of those around her have drawn inspiration 
  from her ideals and vision. We have also come to realise the immense intellectual 
  depth of her analysis, and that has continued to guide the work of UTHR(Jaffna). 
  Even at this dark hour, there are ordinary men and women who shared her concern 
  for the people, risking their lives to carry on her work. Thanks to the worldwide 
  institutionalisation of human rights concerns, her family who most deeply feel 
  her loss, have been sustained .</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Rajani was in many ways a child of her time. 
  The oppressiveness she found in social mores made her rebel against tradition. 
  Yet she was also instinctively traditional in many ways - as a daughter , a 
  wife and&nbsp; a mother. She was instinctively religious and longed for some 
  of the certainties of faith without being an orthodox believer.In rebelling 
  against a tradition that left much to be desired, she walked a tight-rope, a 
  course that was often lonely, confusing and resulting in much private agony. 
  It was a heavy price to pay, but had its rewards as well. Her marriage was unconventional. 
  She married a Sinhalese intellectual from the deep South of peasant origin.This 
  undoubtedly brought her close to the common people of the land as a whole. Her 
  husband's interests shaped the direction of her political views and activism 
  was a product of her marriage.The rewards of such a life are not unmixed with 
  pain. We express our gratitude for the former. Only posterity can do justice 
  to the latter. Rajani lives in having shown us the potential of womanhood for 
  greatness.</span> <a href="#_Toc515974980">[Top]</a></p>
