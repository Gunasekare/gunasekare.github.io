<h3><a name="_Toc515972953">0.1 Press Reports</a> </h3>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Sri Lanka is a small island. The distance 
  from Colombo to Jaffna is barely 250 miles or even less as the crow flies. But 
  it is not unusual for goings on in those now distant parts to reach the pages 
  of the Colombo press, and perhaps the rulers of this land through Reuter International. 
  So the Island of 4th January broke the news of the massacre in the Jaffna Lagoon 
  of the night of Saturday 2nd January, quoting a Reuter report filed from Colombo 
  on the 3rd, headlined:</span> </p>
<p><b><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Nine Civilians Killed in Naval Attack</span></b> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;&quot;Nine civilians were killed on Saturday 
  night when navy patrol craft attacked a flotilla of boats trying to cross Jaffna 
  lagoon where travel is banned, residents said today. Sixteen boats each carrying 
  about 20 people were attacked as they tried to cross the lagoon from Jaffna 
  to the mainland, they said.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;&quot;People panicked and started screaming 
  and shouting,&quot; he said after he reached Vavuniya. &quot;I saw rounds of 
  tracer fly past my boat and hit the water. The Jaffna lagoon, the scene of frequent 
  fire fights between the navy and the Tamil rebels has been declared a no-go 
  zone by the military where people can be shot on sight.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The resident said the firing continued for 
  about 30 minutes.&quot;Only six boats in the flotilla reached the mainland. 
  The rest turned back&quot;, he added. . .</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The Island of&nbsp; 5th January (Tuesday) 
  carried the following item filed by Shamindra Ferdinando, referring to the same 
  incident headlined,</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;&quot;Navy demolishes Tiger boats&quot;</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;&quot;Naval patrol boats operating in the 
  Jaffna lagoon blasted at least four fibre glass dinghies last Saturday night 
  killing over a dozen persons, authoritative military sources revealed yesterday.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;&quot;The dinghies operated by Sea Tigers 
  were moving in a convoy when the Navy patrol boats had swooped down on them. 
  However some of the dinghies had escaped carrying the wounded persons.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;&quot;The Navy boats operating from Nagathevanthurai 
  radar-naval station had confronted the boats while they were moving towards 
  the peninsula the sources indicated . . .&quot;</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;&quot;According to the Joint Operations Command 
  (JOC) the navy's in shore patrol craft operating from Nagathivanthurai were 
  successful in controlling Sea Tiger activities in the Jaffna lagoon. &quot;All 
  boats trying to break the government imposed ban will be dealt with&quot;, an 
  officer said&quot;</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;It appeared from the hard attitude above 
  that the government and its forces had made up their minds that anyone using 
  the Jaffna lagoon was a Tiger crossing in a Tiger boat. Not so, it seems, according 
  to a Daily News front page report of 6th January headlined.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Tiger morale declining day by day</span> 
  <br>
  <span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Nearly 3000 Tigers killed in 1992</span> <br>
  <span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;By Daryll de Silva.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;&quot;A Senior military source yesterday 
  told the Daily News: &quot;They (the Tigers) are now being frowned upon by the 
  very people they claim to be fighting for. It is the people's pressure that 
  will ultimately be their downfall. . . . the Tigers are not allowing any traffic 
  to move up and down through the Elephant Pass Road, although the security forces 
  have repeatedly assured the civilians of Jaffna. .</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;&quot;This he said, left the civilians with 
  no option but the use of `no go' Jaffna lagoon Kilaly Point crossing, at great 
  risk to their lives, as the area is heavily patrolled by the navy.&quot;</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;&quot;Most of those moving to the mainland 
  on the Kilaly crossing were deserters, They are in such poor shape that they 
  are risking their lives to come South. . .&quot;</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Now what have we here? Are civilians Tiger 
  deserters, or is it that Tiger deserters with Tiger passes are crossing the 
  lagoon in Tiger boats? Some were getting their act mixed up.</span> <a href="#_Toc515972952">[Top]</a></p>
<h3><a name="_Toc515972954">0.2 The background</a> </h3>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;This supplements that given in 1.4 of this 
  report. See also 5.1 of <a
href="../Report9/Report9.htm">Report No9</a>. Shortly after the outbreak of war 
  in June 199O the northern railroad was stripped by the Tigers and even road 
  traffic through Elephant Pass, which was under army control, ceased.The Tigers 
  imposed a pass system to stem the civilian exodus and travel to the South became 
  a hazardous affair involving extortionate sums, with civilians subject to occasional 
  attacks from the air.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>Following the LTTE's failed attempt to overrun 
  Elephant Pass in July 1991, the army gradually expanded its control over surrounding 
  areas. It then prohibited civilian traffic through other routes and wanted civilians 
  to travel along the main road through Elephant Pass as during the previous bout 
  of war ending in July 1987. To reinforce the ban and cut off the peninsula, 
  the army subsequently took control of the alternative ferry crossing at Puneryn. 
  The Tigers cited military reasons for themselves banning civilian traffic through 
  Elephant Pass. They claimed that the army would advance behind the civilians 
  into Jaffna. Whether this fear was genuine is questionable. The forces are known 
  to have used civilian cover, particularly in the East, to move about in areas 
  where resistance was likely to be light and sporadic. [See 1.2 and 4.11 of <a
href="../../Briefings/Briefing1.htm">Briefing No. 1</a> &amp; <a
href="chapter6.htm">Ch. 6</a> of this report] But when commencing advances in 
  areas where heavy resistance was to be expected and much publicity would be 
  focused, there was a standard established pattern. This was to declare curfew 
  and advance behind armoured vehicles after heavy pounding from land - based 
  artillery and from the air. This has been the pattern for operations in Jaffna 
  since 1987. Civilian cover was used in Kayts in August 199O, but much after 
  the initial advance and when little resistance was expected.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The forces appear to have had tacitly accepted 
  that the civilians had little choice. After July 1991 civilians continued to 
  use the land route through Kompaddi, an open space about 2 1/2 miles east of 
  Elephant Pass, using boats for the flooded stretches when the rains came from 
  October. People travelled within sight of army sentries, occasionally shelled, 
  but for the most part ignored.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;This continued for about an year, both civilian 
  traffic and essential food supplies travelling by this route, until further 
  consolidation of the army's position in the Elephant Pass area put a stop to 
  this. The forces increased their insistence that civilians must use the Elephant 
  Pass route (highway A-9). With Puneryn cut off the Tigers responded by allowing 
  the civilians to travel only through the 20 mile sea-route from Kilaly - a new 
  course not known to living memory. Ordinary civilians made the crossing at 8 
  knots in slow boats while Tiger boats fitted with several outboard motors did 
  the crossing at about 30 knots or more. Whether the army or the Tigers had greater 
  need for civilian cover in this instance would be a topic for an interesting 
  debate among military strategists.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;It was clear that ordinary civilians had 
  a problem. Once more civilians continued to travel, occasionally shelled from 
  Puneryn and Elephant Pass and sometimes attacked by naval craft, where civilians 
  were killed. [See <a
href="chapter1.htm">Chapter 1 </a>of this report]. But there was no concerted 
  attempt to go all out and kill civilians, at least until December 1992. The 
  intention, from a purely military angle, seemed to be to apply pressure on the 
  civilians to use Elephant Pass.</span> <br>
  &nbsp; </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Even before the present massacre there had 
  been a regular toll on civilians.But this was consistently played down by the 
  Tigers. Little publicity was given to civilian casualties resulting from naval 
  action in the lagoon. Bodies were regularly discovered on the shores by local 
  villagers and buried. The news of these diffused slowly by word of mouth. It 
  is also significant that following the recent massacre, while Tamil political 
  figures in Colombo and the press were reporting the number dead at about 4O 
  or more, the LTTE office in London gave a figure of 14. This is contrary to 
  the normal Tiger practice of multiplying several fold casualties from airforce 
  bombing. Clearly the Tigers were trying not to scare people from using the lagoon, 
  resulting in greater pressure on then to allow the use of Elephant Pass.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The plight of the civilians remained largely 
  unaddressed in a balanced and effective manner. Given the necessity to travel, 
  the civilians had no choice, except to take the course that involved the least 
  risk as they saw it. In October 1992, the BBC correspondent raised with the 
  LTTE spokesman Yogi the question of civilians using Elephant Pass. Yogi responded 
  that this would be agreeable to the LTTE provided that the government gave an 
  assurance that it would not use Elephant Pass for a military advance into Jaffna. 
  The military command gave such a verbal assurance. But the matter dropped and 
  nothing happened with regard to enforcing such an agreement. It was widely remarked 
  by the people that Yogi went off the international air waves for a long time.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Something serious and big was waiting to 
  happen. The first moves towards this began in mid-December. The army began issuing 
  hand bills to travellers through Vavuniya not to use the Kilaly crossing. The 
  Tigers announced through the press in Jaffna that they would offer protection 
  to people using the Kilaly crossing.</span> <br>
  <span style='color:#990000'>Many passengers came to understand later that the 
  Tiger offer of protection amounted to giving fast rides to passengers in their 
  boats for a payment of a sum of Rs. 1500/-. For the vast majority who could 
  not afford it, it was to be the slow boat at Rs. 200/-. Which announcement came 
  first is probably unimportant. From the point of view of the forces it had become 
  a prestige battle. From the Tigers' point of view it was a propaganda gambit. 
  They had neither before nor after demonstrated a will or the capacity to protect 
  civilian traffic in the Jaffna lagoon. Though the navy claims to have destroyed 
  a number of Tiger boats variously ranging from 60 to many more, it is doubtful 
  if even a couple of them were Tiger boats rather than civilian sitting ducks 
  travelling at 8 knots. Both needed to make their point at the people's expense.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;For the navy to make its point, it needed 
  to sink some boats it could lay its hands on (i.e the sitting ducks). For the 
  Tigers to make their point, they needed to fire on navy boats and make a break 
  for it. The worst was bound to happen sometime.</span> <a href="#_Toc515972952">[Top]</a> 
</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc515972955">0.3 The Massacre</a> </h3>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The night's crossing on Saturday 2nd January 
  started in the usual manner. Passengers had queued up and were taking their 
  turn in crossing by boats leaving at intervals carrying 15 to 20 passengers 
  each. The first four boats from Kilaly reached the mainland to the south without 
  incident. A naval gun boat fitted with cannon was in the lagoon at that time. 
  This boat could operate in an area in the centre of the lagoon where the water 
  was deep enough. But could not approach the shores. Whether the naval men saw 
  the first four boats is not known. Since movements were monitored by radar, 
  it is possible that these being slow boats, they were monitored and allowed 
  to pass. We next come to a crucial fact based on the testimony of one witness, 
  but on which most others are understandably reticent. Following the first four 
  boats, according to this witness was a fast boat with three outboard motors 
  of the kind used by Tigers. According to this witness the three or so persons 
  in the boat were not armed and were thought to be Tiger helpers rather than 
  Tigers.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Upon seeing the gun-boat, the fast boat made 
  a U-turn and sped away northwards. The gun-boat gave a chase. The fast boat 
  ran close to a group of passenger boats heading south and escaped northwards. 
  The gun-boat opened fire at these passenger boats from a distance and kept firing 
  for a long time - half an hour according to the Reuter report quoted above.Not 
  having received return fire at any stage, it was then clear that there were 
  no Tigers about the place. The gun-boat did not go any nearer, probably because 
  it was then near shallow water. The stricken passenger boats were then boarded 
  by naval men who came in smaller boats. According to the testimony of Sellathurai, 
  a survivor,(`Virakesari' of 5/1): &quot;<i>A navy boat suddenly appeared alongside 
  our boats and ordered us to stop. Then a torch beam was flashed on us, followed 
  by gun shots. Those in my boat screamed and fell to the ground. I did the same. 
  The other boats were similarly shot at.The boatmen jumped into the sea.&quot;</i></span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;This happened between 7 &amp; 8 p.m and the 
  lagoon water was rough. The navy men set about attacking the passengers at least 
  in one boat with knives irrespective of age and sex. The boats were then towed 
  away. One of the boats broke loose and the navy men left it drifting without 
  attempting to secure it. It was this boat that was brought to the mainland subsequently.In 
  the meantime some other boats had taken in passengers and were about to begin 
  the crossing. Suddenly an LTTE boat appeared and asked them not to cross. Sensing 
  that things were not safe and that there had been a tragedy, many of the women 
  began to cry. Several of the boatmen who had become aneasthetised to danger 
  in return for a small income, told the passengers that if only the Tigers let 
  them go, they would do so without any trouble.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;These boat with casualities which came ashore 
  had about 4 survivors with cut injuries and about 9 corpses. A lady who had 
  lain against the prow of the boat had been missed by the attackers. The first 
  reports to emerge spoke of nine to fifteen or so dead. The figure later rose 
  to over 35 to include passengers from other boats who were either missing or 
  whose bodies were recovered. Among the first to be reported dead or missing 

  were Sellathurai, an employee of the Primary Courts, Mannar, Nalini, a lady 
  in her 20s, a school teacher in Killinochchi and<b> Dr. Sathiaseelan</b>, District 
  Medical Officer of Killinochchi.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;We ascertained the following from a close 
  relative of Sellathurai (quoted above) who spoke to him. He and his wife Parameswary 
  were travelling to Colombo to meet two children living there and two others 
  coming from abroad. Parameswary was among those killed when the naval men opened 
  fire. Sellathurai lay injured. Naval men came into the boat. A naval man first 
  assaulted him and demanded money and jewellery. Sellathurai emptied his purse. 
  The naval man then ripped the gold chain around his dead wife's neck. Sellathurai 
  tried to unscrew her ear rings to give the naval man. An order rang out asking 
  the men to return quickly. The man immediately cut portions the dead woman's 
  ears with the rings and vanished. The boat was then tied for towing,but broke 
  loose. It was left behind. A little later a boat man who had earlier jumped 
  out, came into the boat. It was he who took the boat to the southern shore. 
  Five boats were said to have been taken by the navy.</span> <br>
  <span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;</span> <br>
  <span style='color:#990000'>There was much evidence of the naval men's handiwwork. 
  Many of the bodies recovered were badly mutilated. Tharmaraja,the deceased director 
  of education had an eye gouged out. His thgh too had a deep cut. The corpse 
  of a lady which reached the shore was without its head. Of the five or so boats 
  towed away, the bodies of the dead were placed in one boat and the boat was 
  set on fire according to local reports. Many of the dead also had gaping wounds 
  suggesting that these were caused by cannon rather than small arms. A government 
  version of this incident broadcast over &quot;Makkal Kural&quot; for a Tamil 
  audience did speak about a fast boat which approached the gun-boat, did a U-turn 
  and ran into the passenger boats. But it also added that the fast boat had fired 
  at the navy, which was denied by civilian witnesses. several boats going north 
  reached their destination later in the night completely unaware that there had 
  been an incident. The wind and rough sea would have had the effect of muffling 
  gun shot noises.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The Virakesari of 5/1 said: 14 bodies recovered 
  were brought to the Killinochchi Hospital. Six of the bodies belonged to women. 
  Among the dead was <b>A. Tharmarajah (51)</b> from Nunavil, Regional Director 
  of Education Killinochchi. Of the 14 bodies, only 9 have so far been identified. 
  They are mostly persons from Jaffna past their middle age. The names of the 
  bodies identified were released by <b>K. Ponnampalam, Government Agent, Killinochchi. 
  These are: S.Subramaniam (57), retired police driver; S.Balasubramaniam (40), 
  bakery owner; S. Parameswary (52) and her daughter T. Nalini(20), teacher, D-5 
  Killinochchi; Gopalapillai (40), Tea Boutique owner, Pooneryn; Mdm A. Arulamma 
  (36); V. Sellathurai;(28)</b>, Mannar Courts.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The injured were: <b>Mdm. Rohinidevi Nadarajah 
  (26); N. Selvaratnam, Security Officer, People's Bank, Nallur; K. Alagan (25), 
  trader; K. Sellathurai (62), retired government servant; Aingaran (27), trader</b>. 
  The first was sent to Anuradhapura for advanced surgery.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>The Virakesari report added:<i> &quot;Five boats 
  proceeding South to the mainland were affected during the incident. . . . Those 
  travelling in the lagoon the following (Sunday) morning reported seeing floating 
  corpses. large numbers of ordinary people scoured both shores of the lagoon 
  for more bodies.&quot; </i>Despite the fear travel resumed two days later. As 
  the `Virakesari' of 6th January indicated, the people had become so alienated 
  from the forces, that they had come to believe that the Tigers were their protectors, 
  in Jaffna lagoon at least. There are also reasons for the high incidence of 
  government officers among the victims. It was the Christmas - New Year season. 
  Government leaks to thee Colombo press, highly publicised speeches by the president 
  and reports of Minister Hameed's talks with the LTTE in Europe had all given 
  the impression that an unofficial ceasefire prevailed in the North and that 
  peace was imminent. Thus many government servants and students who needed to 
  cross the lagoon for a quick visit to their families had assumed that this was 
  the best time.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The Virakesari of 9th January reported that 
  a further 11 bodies were recoved in the last few days bringing the total to 
  25. These have not been identified. The Vavuniya Police had said that Rohinidevi 
  Nadarajah who was taken to Anuradhapura hospital had died.</span> <br>
  <span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;There are several aspects of the navy's conduct 
  that are indefensible. The first is the gun-boat firing its cannon towards civilian 
  boats continuously for&nbsp; a considerable time without apparently a single 
  return shot being fired. The second, the frightning spectre of naval personel 
  dominated by indiscipline, greed and a concomitant readiness to kill and rob.</span> 
  <a href="#_Toc515972952">[Top]</a> </p>
<h3><a name="_Toc515972956">0.4 Government responsibility and responses</a> </h3>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The `Virakesari' of 6/1 and the Island of 
  7/1 reported that two Tamil MPs <b>Navaratnam &amp; Premachandran </b>had protested 
  about the incident to the president and had called on him to institute an independent 
  inquiry. There was in the coming few days no direct, response from the president. 
  But oblique government responses appeared in the front pages of the Daily News 
  of 6/1 and 7/1 although the government controlled paper had not recorded the</span> 
  <br>
  <span style='color:#990000'>massacre. The first filed by Lankapuwath headlined 
  `Main highway to Jaffna open since July `91', quoted a JOC spokesman:<i> &quot;The 
  security forces had done their duty by the public of Jaffna by clearing and 
  reopening the main A-9 highway and safe passage was ensured to the public by 
  the security forces. However, the public were being prevented from using&nbsp; 
  the highway by the LTTE who were more interested in extorting money by forcing 
  the public to use their transport in No-Go-Zones and also by preventing the 
  transport of ample stocks of food and other essential items. . . .&quot;</i></span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The second was a print out of what was broadcast 
  the previous day. This seemed to suggest that Jaffna lagoon had only now been 
  declared a prohibited zone. It read: <i>&quot;The Jaffna lagoon has been declared 
  a prohibited zone under section 5 (Chapter 40) of the Public Security Ordinance, 
  under which no person will be permitted to ply or use any vessel, other than 
  a vessel belonging to the Sri Lanka Navy or any vessel authorised in that behalf 
  by the competent authority.</i></span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;<i>&quot;Any person who contravenes the provisions 
  of this regulation will be guilty of an offence. These regulations will be cited 
  as the Emergency (Establishment of a Prohibited Zone) Regulations No. 1 of 1992 
  . . . . A certificate under the hand of the Commander of the Sri Lanka Navy 
  (Competent Authority appointed by the president), to the effect that any area 
  specified in such certificate is within the Prohibited Zone shall be admissible 
  in evidence and shall be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. . 
  . &quot;</i></span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;These attempts at a response lightly skirt 
  the serious issues. The Jaffna highway is by no means cleared and reopened by 
  the security forces in the sense of their being able to offer reasonable protection 
  and right of passage to those who use it. If people travelling on it are stopped 
  at gun-point a few hundred yards up or down the road from Elephant Pass, there 
  is nothing the security forces would do about it, except perhaps fire some shells.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;The second about the prohibited zone is a 
  very euphemistic representation of a harsh reality. It suggests that someone 
  using the prohibited zone will be committing an offence like trespassing on 
  private property. The offender will when caught be taken to court and the naval 
  commander's certificate will be produced as proof of an offence.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Firstly what is the effect of it? The prohibition 
  against the use of Jaffna lagoon has been in force for a long time whether given 
  legal sanction through gazette notification or not. Would the government state 
  publicly that government servants, corporation employees, university staff and 
  employees will not receive promotions and scholarships because the Tigers prevent 
  them from travelling to Colombo through Elephant Pass for appropriate examinations 
  and interviews? Will it pay teachers who cannot report for work for the same 
  reason, or find university places in the South for students so prevented from 
  attending the University of Jaffna? We know from experience that for practical 
  reasons and reasons of bad publicity the government will not take up such positions. 
  Indeed, letters for official functions, conferences, interviews and examinations 
  have been sent as if people could travel without hindrance! Is it then responsible 
  for the government to issue the navy commander with a certificate to enforce 
  the prohibition and close its eyes to the consequences?</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Secondly one must look at the pitiable traditions 
  in which the law of the land and its enforcement have evolved. One positive 
  aspect of the statement of the emergency regulation above is that it indicates 
  limits of action the navy could resort to in enforcing it. Implicitly it implies 
  that the navy could open fire only in self&nbsp; defence. Otherwise it could 
  only stop boats, question people and discretionarily treat them as offenders 
  to be produced in court. Firing on unarmed boats it totally ruled out.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Indeed for navy men to behave like parang 
  wielding pirates of the South China Sea or of the archipelagi of the East Indies 
  is unthinkable. The navy has shown that the spirit of the Kumudini boat massacre 
  of 1985 is very much alive. The action is also reminiscent of the days in 1987, 
  shortly before the Indian army arrived, when government servants in government 
  helicopters used to shoot at government servants on bicycles and vans reporting 
  for work via Kopay Veli (Open Land).</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Here we have the sight of the nation going 
  to pieces by the government not facing up to its responsibilities towards the 
  people and their basic needs.</span> <a href="#_Toc515972952">[Top]</a></p>
<h3><a name="_Toc515972957">0.5 Bad laws and corruption</a> </h3>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;In the 5Os and 6Os the imposition of curfew 
  did not mean that curfew breakers were meant to be shot. The forces were first 
  meant to ascertain whether there was a threat to security. If not there would 
  have been no meaning in the issue of curfew passes. People did get shot without 
  justification. But those with urgent needs, such as one to see a doctor, could 
  often talk their way through. The principle of the state being responsible for 
  the basic welfare of people was acknowledged. Care was taken to give people 
  notice and time to stock up and attend to essential chores. In the treatment 
  of the people of the North today, all these obligations are being violated. 
  Over the years the armed forces have been given the freedom to act without reference 
  to the basic needs of people. The armed forces have been given the freedom to 
  interfere with anything from the transport of essential goods and medicines. 
  Its only effect has been to make lots of people rich without bringing peace 
  any nearer. With the build up of cynicism all round, it has become a war with 
  widespread corruption in the forces accompained by a mistaken sense of pride. 
  Press reports of corruption in sections of the forces have been persistent.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;During the phase of the war ending in July 
  1987 a quantity of basic goods to be distributed through co-operative societies 
  was regularly passed. Today, it is charged by very responsible persons that 
  such societies with the least capacity to bribe are the most harassed by authorities 
  in Colombo, while private traders function smoothly. The Vavuniya check point 
  has been notorious. At times when passes were not issued in Colombo for large 
  quantities of kerosene to the North, lorry loads had been allowed through, while 
  people carrying small quantities with permits of authority coming immediately 
  behind had been sorely harassed.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;We have reliable testimony of a regular run 
  of banned items to the North from the Puttalam lagoon area to the LTTE controlled 
  coast further north with naval complicity. The run needs to be accomplished 
  between times of naval patrols from Talai-Mannar, given in advance. Those in 
  the Wanni intimately familiar with the network of corruption and vested interests 
  surrounding this war despair of its ever coming to an end. Corruption is a means 
  by which basic human needs triumph over the harshest restrictions. But at very 
  great cost to the moral fabric of the nation and the well-being of ordinary 
  people. Malaria, para-typhoid and malnutrition have become endemic among people 
  of the North. A generation of infants in the North is growing up permanently 
  impaired.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;When there is widespread corruption a wrong 
  sense of pride takes over. While allowing banned goods through some channels, 
  there is also an accompanying need for the forces to shoot up civilians and 
  boats transporting innocuous civilian goods in the Jaffna lagoon to prove that 
  a great job is being done in fighting the war. Press statements by the forces 
  unashamedly speak of the cargo of several boats captured or sunk as consisting 
  of stuff like rice bags and bicycles. That is the level at which military success 
  is being measured.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;A large part of the blame for this state 
  of affairs should be placed on the government. Had the government politically 
  identified itself with the well-being of the Tamil people, there would have 
  been no major war in the first place. When political paralysis leads to thinking 
  that the basic needs of the people, guaranteed by international conventions, 
  can be interfered with for military reasons, things are bound to deteriorate. 
  Once an ill-advised decision is taken to make it illegal for people to do what 
  they normally ought to do in the routine course of life, a military force vested 
  with enforcing it cannot be expected to sit around simply watching people get 
  about their lives .</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;If the ban on travel in the Jaffna lagoon 
  were to be lifted it would militarily make little difference to the government. 
  The Tigers will use it with or without a ban, as they did in 1987. It is not 
  food for the Tigers that comes through the lagoon. It is a piece of old wisdom 
  that bad laws which allow ordinary people no alternative but to break them, 
  only bring the law into disrepute and lead to corruption. The ban on travel 
  in the Jaffna lagoon must be lifted. Though appearing to be a military loss, 
  it will be an enormous political gain. Particularly when nearly all press commentators 
  are saying that the military mission of the government is an impossible one, 
  there is a greater practical need to make political gestures to the Tamil people. 
  <a href="#_Toc515972952">[Top]</a></span> </p>
<h3><a name="_Toc515972958">0.6 The responsibility of other organisations</a> 
</h3>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;We have said elsewhere in this report that 
  given the paralysis in the government, there was a duty which fell on other 
  international and civilian organisations to represent the interests of the people. 
  THe people of Jaffna could rightly and legitimately appeal to the government, 
  but they are unable to question the arbitrary actions of the Tigers. This gap 
  should have been filled by others outside, raising matters such as the Elephant 
  Pass affair with the Tigers. Sadly most statements and observations talked about 
  the government forces shooting at civilians in the Jaffna lagoon without asking 
  why the Tigers forced them to endure this. Clearly the interests of the people 
  are not being represented. When asked why the Tigers make them travel in this 
  manner, the usual answer is `We cannot speak'. It is one thing for leading international 
  figures, such as church men to promote the Tigers as sole representatives of 
  the Tamil people. If so they should be able to talk to them and influence them 
  to act in the interests of the people. If not leadership becomes a totally vacuous 
  and a merely verbal concept.</span> </p>
<p><b><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Army spokesman on the Jaffna Lagoon</span></b> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Reporting on the Cabinet news conference 
  of&nbsp; the previous day, the Island of 8th January reported as follows: &quot;The 
  military is prepared to consider opening the Jaffna lagoon which has been declared 
  a `prohibited zone' for civilian traffic to and from the&nbsp; Jaffna peninsula 
  during daylight under strict naval surveillance, military spokesman Brigadier 
  Anil Angamana announced yesterday.&quot;</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;Purely as a gesture, this announcement is 
  welcome. Whether it will bear fruit or not depends on whether there is also 
  the will to give considerable priority to the needs of civilians.</span> </p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;More inexcusably the military spokesman still 
  continued to deny having received confirmation of the civilian deaths, although 
  the list was issued by the senior-most government officer of the district. Also 
  there is the ICRC reporting directly to the president in addition to Reuter. 
  The government it seems had no contact with the government agent of Killinochchi. 
  But the spokesman when asked about the District Education Officer killed in 
  the incident said, &quot;I heard that he was executed by the LTTE&quot;. The 
  government's response in such instances continues to be silly and counter-productive.</span> 
</p>
<p><span style='color:#990000'>&nbsp;It transpired in the Cabinet news conference 
  that the government had no defensible position on the Kilaly issue, except to 
  repeat an umpteen times that the A-9 through Elephant Pass was the normal authorised 
  route to Jaffna. It was as though its being blocked by some other force that 
  could not be dislodged was not a fact to be taken cognizance of. In its blundering 
  manner the government was trying to limit the damage by pretending that the 
  navy's action was purely a military matter. That it was an act of blatant piracy 
  was something the government did not have the character to face up to.</span>
