<p class=MsoHeading9 align=center style='text-align:center'><a
name="_Toc515632368">THE I C R C</a><span lang=EN-GB></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>Our last report (No.4) presented some views about the role 
  of the ICRC shared by several of our southern friends, particularly because 
  they were relevant to the issue of the safety of Tamil prisoners. The main 
  intention was to provoke thinking on the matter rather than to give a thoroughly 
  researched conclusion. We emphasise that our friends are responsible persons, 
  who are sympathetic to the plight of Tamils and some of them have taken a stand 
  in confronting the National Defence Fund. Also, while being positive about 
  the role of the ICRC in the current war, they feel that the ICRC could have 
  been more effective in the South. As for killing of prisoners by the forces, 
  opposition members have raised questions in parliament during the past few weeks. 
  Only the extent seems to remain in question.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>Another group of friends has expressed strong protest over 
  the piece. They have said it was unbalanced and have made the following points: 
  The ICRC is experienced at tracing prisoners not officially accounted for and 
  because of the confidentiality observed by the ICRC, the state has no difficulty 
  in making un official prisoners official. Prisoners not known to exist have 
  been traced while looking for others and once identified by the ICRC, prisoners 
  are fairly safe. The Amnesty is in the first place not allowed into this country 
  and can only publicise information without necessarily being able to save prisoners. 
  They said that the ICRC has saved many prisoners and hoped the people would 
  not be discouraged from making representations to the ICRC. They also denied 
  that the ICRC could not be blamed for the killings which followed their arrival 
  as they needed time to set up a machinery. Criticisms of the ICRC they felt 
  was damaging as many Sinhalese chauvinists would like to get rid of the ICRC, 
  and are saying that it is helping the LTTE.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>On the other side, it is maintained that there is little 
  danger that the ICRC will be seen as pro-LTTE and that the ICRC was seen to 
  be more useful to the government. This was owing to the fact that the ICRC 
  reported to the head of state - President Premadasa. It was the government 
  they say who derived propaganda mileage from the ICRC presence and not the LTTE 
  or the JVP. The president was able to point to the ICRC presence to suggest 
  that little was amiss on the human rights front, while no substantial change 
  had been effected. In the meantime they say, some NGO&#146;s who were closely 
  watching the government&#146;s conduct, became less disappointed expectations. 
  They say that this situation would have been rectified, if instead of leaving 
  the initiative with the government, the ICRC had, through the press, told the 
  public what to expect and what not to expect. Unreal hopes were fed when the 
  government was able to give the impression that all was going to be well because 
  the ICRC was here. This was put to the ICRC by a group of university teacher 
  who met the ICRC. These persons far from being hostile to the ICRC were only 
  hoping to make it more effective. Some of them routinely advice students on 
  how to make effective use of the ICRC when their fellows get into trouble. 
  The ICRC&#146;s denial through the press of the government&#146;s claim that 
  the LTTE was preventing the ICRC from taking food to Jaffna, is the kind of 
  thing that will enhance faith in its impartiality.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>In the meantime, undeserved use of the ICRC to boast the 
  government&#146;s image, can come not just from the government but also from 
  quarters committed to liberal democracy. This comes in the wake of a breakdown 
  of civil society through terror and confusion among those who believed in liberal 
  values. Recently, President Premadasa was the chief guest at the annual sessions 
  of the Bar Association. The President of the Bar Association in his speech 
  heaped almost unqualified praise on Premadasa - as sharing their values, having 
  the highest regard for the judiciary, and the associations appreciation of his 
  respect for human values. The same speech praised the government for having 
  invited the ICRC in response to a call by the Association. It was also a speech 
  which was diplomatically balanced. It hoped for a resolution of conflicts by 
  negotiation rather than by violence and spoke of lawyers having been killed 
  or threatened for appearing in Habeas Corpus and Fundamental Rights cases.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>But in the reporting of this by the state media, it was the 
  praise of the president that was prominent, and the latter was reduced to virtually 
  small print. The casual reader would either read the praise, become angry and 
  form his suspicions about the ICRC, or would take it that all was well.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>That is why we have argued that it is futile for essentially 
  powerless individuals to think that the state can be changed through flattery 
  and diplomatic dealing, however well-meant. Such diplomacy naturally leads 
  to complacency and insensitivity.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>In such a society, where even nominally independent and influential 
  civilian bodies have been reduced to ineffectiveness through a climate of terror, 
  there is a greater need for international organisations like the ICRC to make 
  sure that their role is not misunderstood.</p>
