<h3><a name="_Toc515634464">5.1 Trincomalee District, 8<sup>th</sup> July:</a><span
lang=EN-GB></span></h3>
<p class=MsoListContinue>Dear Akka (elder sister) and Thangi (younger sister). 
  This a missive from your loving brother. We scrambled in fear because of the 
  atrocities unleashed by the armed forces at mid-day on Friday, 22<sup>nd</sup> 
  June. Siva and his family were killed. The four in our family were also at 
  the same place. I alone am left living. Father, mother and sister were killed. 
  What can we do? Do not be sad. But they are taking away the young boys. I 
  do not have my identy card and am very much afford. If you can, please ask 
  the boss where you are working and try to get me to Colombo soon. I am now 
  staying at the refugee camp at Nilaveli Church. Do let the others know. I 
  had sent two letters earlier.</p>
<p class=MsoListContinue><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>Your loving brother.........</span></p>
<h3><a name="_Toc515634465">5.2 Colombo, 3<sup>rd</sup> week of August:</a><span
lang=EN-GB></span></h3>
<p class=MsoListContinue>A Muslim lad from Kalmunai in the East was in the class 
  of a Tamil lady lecturer at a Colombo institute. The lad was friendly with 
  the lady and used to approach her privately to have his difficulties cleared. 
  The lady found that the boy had got into difficulties over paying his fees. 
  The reason she discovered was that the boy&#146;s parents had hoped to make 
  a profit of Rs.55,000/- from their paddy harvest and send him Rs.10,000/- for 
  his exepeses. But they had been unable to go their paddy land which was in 
  a Tamil village. The lady offered to contribute towards his fees from her salary. 
  But the boy declined. Over the period of Tamil-Muslim tension in the East, 
  the boy ceased to go to her. She ran into him shortly after the massacres of 
  Muslims at Kattankudy and Eravur. She asked him why he had not come. The boy 
  replied that he had many uncleared difficulties, but that he would face problems 
  from his community if he came to her. He said that he had moved out of his 
  room to a shophouse, because the mother of his room-mate from Eravur had come 
  down. His room-mate&#146;s father and youngest brother had been killed. On 
  the 12<sup>th</sup> August, someone had called out in Sinhalese. The youngest 
  brother had gone to the door and was shot down. The father ran to his youngest 
  son before the mother could stop him. He too was killed. The villagers said 
  that the LTTE was responsible for the massacre.</p>
<p class=MsoListContinue>The boy was absent from classes for a week and returned 
  later. He said that his parents had been able to harvest some of their paddy 
  under army protection and had sent him money to settle his fees. The Tigers, 
  who had harvested some of their paddy earlier had warned them not to come again 
  under army escort. He added that since the army was not going to be around 
  all the time, the warning had to be taken seriously.</p>
<p class=MsoListContinue>The lady also said that there was a Muslim officer at 
  her bank who used to come out of his way to attend to Tamil customers, while 
  the Sinhalese officers treated them with indifference. This time the Muslim 
  officer smiled from a distance. But did not come forward.</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc515634466">5.3 Colombo, 4<sup>th</sup> week of August:</a><span
lang=EN-GB></span></h3>
<p class=MsoListContinue>A Tamil lady met a Muslim boy from Samanthurai who had 
  come to Colombo to try for a visa to go to Canada. He said that some Muslims 
  had been killed at the Veeramunai Mosque. Asked what he felt was behind the 
  troubles, he explained: When two people are in a compound a third person shies 
  stones at one or both of them, and sits giggling behind a wall, while the first 
  two accuse and tear at each other. That is what is going on now. He further 
  added: &#147;Only ten percent can understand that it is instigated.&#148;</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc515634467">5.4 Jaffna 12<sup>th</sup> August:</a><span
lang=EN-GB></span></h3>
<p class=MsoListContinue>The bombing during these last few days has been severe. 
  The noise is unbearable and there have been many casualties. A bomb which fell 
  inside Schwartz Lane, by God&#146;s grace, did not explode. Many people in 
  that area have just left by van for Kayts. My daughters-in-law left with them 
  with her infant daughter. The people are thoroughly worn down. May god protect 
  us.....Love, amma.</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc515634468"><span lang=EN-GB>5.5 Jaffna, 7<sup>th</sup> August:</span></a><span lang=EN-GB> 
  </span></h3>
<p class=MsoList>....Vast number of youth are joining the movement, some as an 
  outlet to their own family circumstances and others deceived into believing 
  that training is for self- defence purpose only. A large percentage of youth 
  are being treated as psychiatric patients - constant bombing and shelling thought 
  this new wave of violence triggers vivid memories for those having seen their 
  loved once killed previously. What will become of this generation? The government 
  proceeds to order new bomber from Italy, now numbering ten. Because pamphlets 
  have been dropped warning civilians to vacate a certain radius, loss of life 
  has been less this time, though property damage has been much greater. The 
  LTTE claim civilian deaths are too low for international propaganda and intervention....</p>
<p class=MsoListContinue>June 25<sup>th</sup> is a date I will never forget. 
  The bombing and shelling began at 3.00 a.m. and continued most of the following 
  day - it was brutal. The pattern seemed to Fort, Palaly, Karainagar and back 
  again. Each time the bombers passed over- head and in many instance, we could 
  actually see the bullets from the heli-firing in Chunnakam market. I was amazed 
  to hear that the bomber pilot&#146;s conversation could be clearly heard through 
  the FM 1000 antenna. What was even more disturbing was to hear callous comments 
  in English! One such conversation went as follows: &#147;Do you see the library, 
  go to the second junction, the two storey white building behind the pavilion 
  is the target&#148;, and seconds later we heard the bomb around the Fort. Sometimes 
  the response was &#147;completely out&#148; and once the pilot exclaimed, &#147;beautifully 
  done!.&#148; I could hardly believe that I was listening to a real life situation 
  and the sick feeling of being helpless to prevent someone&#146;s inevitable 
  death moments later.</p>
<p class=MsoListContinue>Another conversation said, :How many bombs do you have 
  left? .....One.....Drop it anywhere you like and return to base (Vavniya)&#148;. 
  Then suddenly we heard &#147;I&#146;m too high.... Don&#146;t come lower than 
  5000 feet.....(later).....We&#146;re under fire.....Pull out, I said pull out&#148;.</p>
<p class=MsoListContinue>At 3.00 p.m. that same day some one informed us that 
  the LTTE was holding a meeting at the nearly school. This was the first of 
  many meetings for gold collections, training camps, refugee camps with an LTTE 

  office on the premises - it almost seemed as if the famous school was being 
  targeted. That evening we decided to build a bunker.</p>
<p class=MsoListContinue><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>Since all the palmyrah trees are being chopped, there will soon be an environmental 
  crisis, not to mention that this particular tree is the source of food and employment 
  for many.</span></p>
<p class=MsoListContinue>By early evening the news came that Jaffna was burning 
  and the sky was filled with heavy black clouds. An eeric silence loomed and 
  the spirits were at an all-time low. The looting of shops and homes became 
  rampant that night as people evacuated the area and poverty escalated......</p>
<p class=MsoListContinue>The LTTE has stated clearly that this is the final fight 
  and that they are not prepared for further talks. Yogi makes such statements 
  that all should worship the gun and not think of peace at this time. Fear of 
  the army marching and a sense of desperation has given the people no alternative 
  but to side with &#147;the Boys&#148; though most have lost confidence in their 
  actions. Everyone longs for peace yet no one has a voice to speak in this silenced 
  nation for fear of not living long enough to enjoy it. I was disheartened to 
  learn that the church, in most instances, feels they do not have a part to play 
  in this process.....</p>
<p class=MsoListContinue>Development projects have all come to a half and NGO&#146;s 
  are attempting to organise relief into the peninsula under trying circumstances. 
  The Tigers have set up an organisation called the ROOTE to discuss projects 
  and funding of NGO&#146;s in the North. Since people are bound by silence,

<h3><a name="_Toc515634469">5.6 The Policeman, Akkaraipattu, mid-August</a><span
lang=EN-GB></span></h3>
<p class=MsoListContinue>A church worker was travelling to the East when his passenger 
  van stopped at Wellawaya. A man got in who had obviously recovered from a long 
  illness. It became evident from his talk that he was one of the Muslims policemen 
  who had surrendered to the LTTE at Kalmunai, in June and had been taken into 
  the jungle along with others to killed. He showed the church worker two injuries 
  on his head and one on his shoulder. After being lined up and sprayed with 
  automatics, the executioners had come and looked at them, firing single shots 
  at those who groaned or moved. The policeman said that he had resolved to act 
  dead until everything was clear. He then struggled along to the lonely hut 
  of a Tamil chena cultivator. This man had cared for him and helped his escape.</p>
<p>The policeman who was returning to his native village of Akkaraipattu, said 
  that he harboured no ill-feelings against Tamils. It was the LTTE who had done 
  this him. On the other hand he was helped by a Tamil peasant. He recalled 
  that the Bible had much in common with the Quoran. He made the church worker 
  promise that he would send him a copy of the Bible, which he hoped to read during 
  his convalescence.</p>
