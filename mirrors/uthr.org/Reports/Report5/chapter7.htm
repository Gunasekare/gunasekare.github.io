  Kandavallai : 21<sup>st</sup> August</span></a><span lang=EN-GB></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>The normal route from Vavuniya to Jaffna was blocked, and 
  the Pooneryn ferry was bombed. The route through Kandavalai across the bed 
  of the lagoon - passable by light vehicles and persons on foot during summer 
  - became the high road to Jaffna. On this day one militant who was carrying 
  a gun was also going along with others who crossed that open lagon bed. One 
  helicopter which was hovering above spotted the boy and gave a chase. The travellers 
  ran here and there for shelter. Two priests were also there. 6 people dived 
  for cover into a bush. The militant boy also ran into the same bush. The helicopter 
  sprayed the bush and killed all of them. They landed the helicopter and took 
  off after a man had stripped the boy&#146;s weapon.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>The callousness of the government and the army has prevented 
  the people from carrying out their normal lives. The lack of humanity by helicopter 
  gunners is only too commonplace</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB>10<sup>th</sup> August : Chettikulam</span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>25 civilians were dismembered by the army in Chettikulam. 
  They were hacked to death with their hands and legs severed. Among those killed 
  3 were relatives of Sister Sagunthala, who belongs to the Sisters of Charity 
  in Kollupitiya. The information came from Roman Catholic authorities in the 
  Mannar district.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>A refugee at Madhu said that on the 11<sup>th</sup> the army 
  rounded up 17 men in Vavuniya. Only he had escaped death. m The rest, he said, 
  had been shot and killed. It was believed that this incident and the last one 
  were reprisals for the blasting of a bridge, in which some soldiers were killed.</p>
<p class=MsoList>7.3 Thiruketheeswaram, 2<sup>nd</sup> August (From the Veerakesari)</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>According to the government sources, 5 sentry point which 
  were in the neighbourhood of Thiruketheesweram railway station, Mannar, were 
  destroyed by the security forces from Thallady camp. </p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB>Following this, the security forces, who 
  came in several armoured vehicles surrounded the Thiruketheesweram temple and 
  fired at random.</span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>They set fire to the &#145;inn&#146; catering for sojourners 
  and the temple trustee&#146;s houses. They also burnt the tractor and the lorry 
  which brought refugees to the temple. They, then opened all the stores and 
  looted everything. They also forced open the rest-houses and searched till 
  noon.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>The following day several hundreds of them came again in 
  3 lorries and were shooting at random in the temple premises. They took away 
  the generator and miscellaneous property belonging to the temple. During the 
  whole operation they did not evince any interest in terrorists.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB>In the whole operation they neither looked 
  for the militants nor caught any of them.</span></p>

  army atrocities and are now at the refugee camp in South India.

  I came down Rs.50. He could not give even a cent. So I returned back to 
  after 15 days. I realized that if we do not get away from that place, we will 
  have to die of starvation. So we proceeded with the intention of going to India.</p>

  10 miles. On the way a few elderly as well as little ones died of starvation.

  with a one footed carter who was generous enough to take us to which 
  was a 7 miles journey. There a pot of drinking water was Sold at Rs.2.50.

<p class=MsoList>7.5 The Rural North</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>The people living in the middle part of the North-East are 
  relatively poor, when compared to the others. Framing and fishing are their 
  main livelihood. This applies to most people from Mannar to Mulaithivu, and 
  from Pallai to Mathavachi. These people were the most affected by the wars 
  that took place in the North-East. In addition to army atrocities, farming 
  and fishing were disrupted. This forced many people to evacuate their place 
  and seek refugee camp or go across to India.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>According to government sources, the food that was sent to 
  these people was a small fraction of what was needed there. There were several 
  cases of people who died of starvation without proper medical care or who committed 
  suicide. One such incident was at Palai where 12 in a family committed suicide, 
  among whom 7 were boys and the father was an invalid. This was reported in 
  Parliament on the 27<sup>th</sup> August by a Tamil M.P. M. Letchumi of Kilinochchi 
  was among those who committed suicide due to starvation. According to Veerakesari 
  of 8<sup>th</sup> August, during June, July, in the Kilinochchi area alone 50 
  died. More than 150 were injured. On the 24<sup>th</sup> July the government 
  imposed a 72 hrs curfew in Kilinochchi with the intention of putting up an army 
  camp. Kilinochchi was subject to heavy air attacks. Many got stranded in Paranthan. 
  Few persons went missing. Heavy damage was caused to property and agriculture 
  due to bombing. Many animals died to air attacks. Nearly 200-3-- animals were 
  found dead in Kilinochchi.</p>

  Operation Fort</span></a><span

<p class=MsoBodyText>An indefinite curfew was imposed in the Jaffna district, 
  since the 24<sup>th</sup> (Wednesday) morning with leaflets air dropped in Jaffna 
  warning people to stay indoors. Since morning air force fighters and bombers 
  have staffed LTTE position in the peninsula while the navy was firing shells 
  from Karaingar. 2000 troops from two battalions were brought to Kayts by air 
  and sea Kayts is one of the Island off the peninsula, 10 miles from the Jaffna 
  Fort, where 50,000 civilians are living. Within 3 days the army moved into 
  Mandaithevu (another Island) and Allaipitty. It was reported abroad by the 
  Tigers that there were heavy civilian casualties at Mandaithevu. At the time 
  of writing the operation to relieve Jaffna Fort is still going on.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB>The incidents given below are taken from 
  the &#145;Veerakesari&#146;, which were confirmed by other sources.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Revenge killings of the Muslims and Tamils are still going 
  on, even at the time we write this. Most of the Tamil residences in Chenkallady, 
  Eravur and Thannnamunai were burnt to ashes. Many took refuge in a Catholic 
  church at Chenkallady. A Sexton of this Catholic church was hacked to death 
  while several others were assaulted. The refugees found that even the churches 
  were not secure places. They fled to the jungles out of fear. Former M.P. 
  Devanayagam&#146;s brother Arasakone, who was a lawyer and a Sinnapoddyar were 
  also among victims who were hacked to death.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>They were staying together in Kandy. On the 8<sup>th</sup> 
  of July, 4 men in black uniforms went in night and put them in their jeeps and 
  drove away. They did not give ear to the land lady&#146;s good recommendations 
  about those students. They only said that they were taking them just for an 
  inquiry.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>When the news got around the parents went and inquired at 
  the police station as well the army camp at Araipoddai. They denied that they 
  ever apprehended such persons. The anguished mothers came to Colombo and lamented
