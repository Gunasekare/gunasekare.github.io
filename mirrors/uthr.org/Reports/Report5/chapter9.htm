<h3><a name="_Toc515632357"></a><a name="_Toc515635175"><span lang=EN-GB>9.1 
  Eastern Province, Southern Sector : The Events of June</span></a><span lang=EN-GB></span></h3>
<p class=MsoBodyText>In our report No.4, we gave some indication of what had happened 
  in this area. But precise information was unavailable. The following description 
  of event was compiled for this report by a group of university students from 
  that area.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>We have already described the fighting at Kalmunai police 
  Station, the death in an ambush of 11 soldiers and the killing by the LTTE of 
  several policemen who had surrendered. What followed has remained largely unknown 
  as the result of an official news black out. These massacres of Tamils, coupled 
  with the highly visible use of Muslims by the security forces laid the ground 
  for succeeding tragedies.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>On 11<sup>th</sup> June there was a detachment of soldiers 
  at the Kalmunai guest House which too came under attack by the LTTE. Eight 
  soldiers escaped by sea while an unknown number were killed. Kalmunai town, 
  which was mostly inhabited by Tamil was then shelled by the army from Kondavedduvan, 
  18 miles away. Of the 28 who were killed, nearly all were Tamils. On 21<sup>st</sup> 
  June, the army advanced from Amparai into Weeramunai. 150 males were rounded 
  up, tied, piled in groups surrounded by wooden blocks on four sides, and were 
  then set on fire.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>On the 20<sup>th</sup>, the Karaitivu refugee camp which 
  was set up in a school and was flying a white flag, was bombed from a helicopter, 
  killing 3 and injuring 3. The army arrived in Karaitivu on the 21<sup>st</sup> 
  noon and rounded up all males. 26 of them were shoved into a room and a grenade 
  was thrown, followed by automatic firing. There of them escaped miraculously. 
  At about 3 p. m. 25 were burnt ar Karaitivu junction.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>A large number of males were brought into Kalmunai on the 
  same day. Over 250 were tied, shot and burnt. Of those who escaped, one fell 
  into the police station toilet pit, one with burns fell into a well and died 
  and another was admitted to the Nintavur hospital. 3000 were detained in the 
  Kalmunai Kachcheri, three ladies amongst whom were raped. 100 of them were 
  later taken to Amparai along with the forces who went to attack the LTTE camp 
  in Kanjikuddichcharu. There is no definite information on what happened to 
  them. It is believed that they were used in some way as a human shield. 75 
  of the detainees at the Kalmunai Kachcheri were murdered during the night. 
  The rest were released. Many shops in Kalmunai were burnt with dead bodies 
  inside them. Some of these shops are Photo Rio, Vel Stores, Uma Traders, Cecelia 
  Recording Bar and Saraswathy Hotel. Skulls were also found in front of Wesley 

  College. During the round up at Karativu, Muslim militants operating with the 
  army had reportedly pointed out particularly those males who in time would become 
  community leaders school teachers, university students and even professionals.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>There was another round up at Karaitivu on the 27<sup>th</sup>. 
  75 were taken to Nainakadu and were burnt. 80 were taken from Pandiruppu and 
  what happened to them is not known. There were to more round ups of Neelawanai, 
  Maruthamunai and Pandiruppu. 34 were missing after the first and 40 after the 
  second. During the following days. a white coloured van used to take away persons 
  released by the army from Kalmunai and Karaitivu. A female teacher who went 
  from the Kalmunai refugee camp to ask for food from the GS (HEADMEN) was raped 
  by the army. In due course 27 headless bodies were washed ashore on Kalmunai 
  beach.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>Figures of missing persons compiled by local citizens&#146; 

  groups stood at about 4000 for Batticaloa, 200 for Karaitivu, 5000 for the Kalmunai 
  AGA&#146;s division and above 1200 for Amparai. Official sources put the number 
  of Muslims killed at 7000. </p>

<h3><a name="_Toc515632358"></a><a name="_Toc515635176"><span lang=EN-GB>9.2 
  Tamil - Muslim Troubles in the East, 1979 - 87</span></a><span lang=EN-GB></span></h3>
<p class=MsoBodyText>The following brief outline of Tamil-Muslim troubles in the 
  East was again complied by a group of university students from the area. There 
  was suspicion and bouts of tension as would not be unusual between two communities 
  living side by side. From the escalation that can be discerned in this account, 
  it could be seen that earlier troubles were in the nature of minor clashes 
  between rowdy elements on both sides. These differences assumed sinister proportions 
  when the state set out to exploit these differences.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>In 1979, Jalaldeen, a Muslim tailor in Akkaraipattu, cut 
  the plait of a Tamil girl at the main bus stand. In the clashes that followed, 
  some Muslims cut off the ear of a Tamil and the Tamils in turn cut the ears 
  of 6 or 7 Muslims. Then things calmed down. In 1981 again rioting broke out 
  after some Muslim boys bathing in the river splashed water on some Tamil girls 
  who passed by on the bridge. This too calmed down quickly.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>On 13<sup>th</sup> April 1985, members of the PLOTE in Karaitivu, 
  took car of a Muslim at gun point and also robbed some bags of rice from Muslims. 
  Muslims from Kalmunai and Maligaikkadu came along with the Special Task Force 
  (STF), burnt over 5000 Tamil houses in Karaitivu and killed about 40 Tamils. 
  Hindu temples were also desecrated.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>At 10.00 p. m. on 15<sup>th</sup> April 1985, a cry went 
  out over the hailer at the Kattankudy Mosque, saying that the Tamils are coming 

  to attack, and called upon Muslims to come to the Mosque with sticks and knives. 
  Because of the tension in Kalmunai, Tamil boys armed with petrol bombs, knives, 
  swords and a few shotguns, had been guarding the Manjanthoduwa (Navatkudah) 
  - Kattankudy border. Manjanthoduwa was inhabited by a Dhoby (washermen) community. 
  They sighted an armoured car with rotating lights, leading a group of similarly 
  armed Muslims. Suddenly, the house of a dhoby caught fire. No one quite knew 
  how. The Tamils ran away. The Muslims proceeded to burn houses in Manjanthoduwa 
  while the police armoured car circled the area. The Tamils returned in the 
  morning and set fire to some Muslim houses in Manjathoduwa. Later on 9 Tamils 
  who went into the area to retrieve belongings were hacked to death by Muslims. 
  5 Muslims who travelled to Kattankudy from Batticaloa, unaware of the disturbances, 
  were killed by Tamils.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>Following the LTTE&#146;s war with the IPKF, in December 
  1987, Muslim and Tamil LTTE cadre from the locality demanded large sums of money, 
  amounting to several lakhs of rupees each, from Muslim businessmen in Kattankudy. 
  Two Muslim supporters of the LTTE were shot dead allegedly by members of the 
  Jihad. The LTTE took away 15 jihad suspects in a van and demanded that the 
  remaining Jihad members should surrender. Again suspected Jihad members shot 
  dead 6 Tamil labourers employed in Kattankudy, one of whom was an LTTE supporter. 
  The Jihad consisted of Muslim homeguards trained and armed by the state during 
  the last 3 years as a counter to the Tamil insurgency.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>As a reprisal,the following day the LTTE stopped a passenger 
  coach from the Hijira company at Navatkudah, carrying passengers from Colombo 
  to Kalmunai and Kattankudy. 30 of the Muslim passengers were killed. The 15 
  suspects who were taken in earlier were also killed. Earlier during September, 
  some LTTE cadre were also behind the burning of Muslim shops in Kalmunai. It 
  can be seen that the LTTE as early as 1987 had adopted Sri Lankan army traditions 
  in its dealings with Muslims. The totalitarian demands of its ideology led 
  to poor quality of leadership in the East. Able local leaders such as Kadavul 
  and Francis were driven to isolation while those amenable to Jaffna control 
  were brought into prominence. The lack of democracy in the LTTE and its insensitivity 
  to Eastern problems and to the vulnerability of Tamils there, laid the foundation 
  for a major disaster.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>9.3 The East : What the People feel</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>For the Tamil and Muslim people of the East, it is a time 
  of major reappraisal. They have been victims of intrigue. The people were 
  the victims of every move by the powers around. Following the IPKF inspired 
  conscription campaign which was widely resented, for those not subject to Tiger 
  suspicion and victimisation, the Tigers for a time appeared to offer them dignity. 
  Tamil passengers could go past police barriers in the South, simply casting 
  the logs aside while the police looked on. Such people found it an exhilarating 
  experience in contrast to the memories of 1983. Tamils appeared to be strong 
  for once a tragically shortlived illusion.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>But when one looks closely, irresponsible and cynical as 
  it was on India&#146;s part, views on the conscription for the TNA in the East 
  are more complex. Some Tamil villages in the East which felt most threatened 
  by adjoining Sinhalese and Muslim villages, sent their young voluntarily to 
  the TNA. In some ways the TNA was the direct result of the government&#146;s 
  failure in its pledge to devolve power to the provincial council for the North- 
  East, and most importantly its failure to appoint the promised police commission 
  for the North-East. The SLMC leader has blamed the present tragedy on the security 
  vacuum created as a result, out of deference to the LTTE. The LTTE with its 
  power base in Jaffna failed to appreciate how the Tamils of the East had been 
  cornered by events into depending on India. It simply branded as traitors all 
  those who had dealings with the Indian state, something that it had itself done 
  very prominently not long ago. In conniving with the Sri Lankan government 
  to dismantle the prospects of a healthy provincial council for the North-East 
  in control of its own security, the LTTE had removed the very basis for minimising 
  dependence on India. To many in the East, the LTTE theoretician Balasingam&#146;s 
  pledge made in Jaffna on 18<sup>th</sup> May, that in the event of the government 
  failing to do justice to them, they would &#145;not hesitate to take up to arms 
  to protect our people and to carry on our aims&#146;, would seem a black farce. 
  The LTTE simply took on the police and army sometimes killing them, and then 
  withdrew from population centers, leaving the people at the memory of advancing 
  forces in a vindictive mood.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>A very eminent scholar with close connections in the East 
  had this to say: &#147;I talked to some of my highly placed friends. They 
  said that every gain made during the IPKF presence has been lost. The Tamils 
  had been relatively secure and the coastal path from Jaffna to Trincomalee and 
  Batticaloa was clear. I do not know how we are going to recover from this. 
  People continue to disappear. A good deal of Tamil property in Trincomalee 
  has been taken over. All Tamils in the residential area of Orr&#146;s Hill 
  have been driven out. People are even afraid to complain about missing persons. 
  The provincial governor is sympathetic, but he is helpless.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>&#147;People in Jaffna fail to appreciate what the IPKF meant 
  to the people of the East. True, had a nasty experience. But a price has to 
  be paid for taking on an army. But in the East, many Tamils and even Muslims, 
  have a good word to say for the IPKF. Do you realise what it was like for the 
  people of Trincomalee during the dark days of 1983? The Sri Lanka forces,particularly 
  the navy, went on a rampage. People were cowering in their houses. Suddenly, 
  the house caught fire when burning oil soaked rags were thrown in. When they 
  tried to escape being burnt to death, they were shot as curfew breakers. </p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>&#147;You people in Jaffna cannot understand the gravity 
  of the problems confronting the Easterners. When there is trouble, you find 
  it relatively easy to find places to stay in Colombo or even to go abroad. 
  Mow many from the East have facilities to stay in Colombo?</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>&#147;The government has gone back on every pledge made to 
  the Tamils and has dishonoured every which will take every opportunity to ensure 
  that the Tamils get nothing. The LTTE played into their hands. Take the EPRLF- 
  led provincial administration. They were elected, though in a process which 
  was as unsatisfactory as the presidential and parliamentary elections. They 
  were, with there serious faults,willing to surrender their arms work within 
  the framework of Sri Lanka. But the government failed to honour its pledges. 
  The Chief Minister is blamed by the government for declaring a state of Eelam. 
  But he did this only when the flood waters were at the gates, when the LTTE 
  backed by the government was creating a situation where he had to flee. Instead 
  of sympathising with him, the very government which let him down scorned him 
  and poked fun at his discomfiture. That evinced a deplorable human quality 
  very distant from statesmanship. What was one to expect in a deal between the 
  LTTE and such a government? With all their sommersaults and their hypocrisy, 
  the LTTE can out saying that the government had betrayed them and the Tamils. 
  The government in turn would oblige by proving them right.&#148;</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>A Muslim government official from the East, expressed a feeling 
  shared by many Tamils. He felt that the LTTE was not serious about raising 
  their eastern recruits to leadership positions, where Jaffna influence was dominant. 
  There was a tendency, he said, to use local Muslim and Tamil recruits as frontline 
  material.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>An eastern citizens&#146; committee figure, not unsympathetic 
  to the Tigers, became reflective as the disastrous was progressed. He said, 
  &#147;I wonder, whether at this rate, the Tamils have a future in the East.&#148; 
  While saying that the Tigers had made sacrifices, he known to him, who had been 
  bypassed or had been victimised with what he felt were undeserved allegations. 
  He voiced strong feelings over the other Tamil groups and the SLMC, whom he 
  thought were trying to use the Sri Lankan army to re-establish their influence. 
  He added, &#147;If the Tigers were not serious about the East, they should have 
  left us alone.&#148;</p>
