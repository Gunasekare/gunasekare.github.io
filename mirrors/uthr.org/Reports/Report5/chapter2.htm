<p class=MsoBodyText>Following the outbreak of war, all Tamils were rendered refugees,a 
  large number of them fleeing to Thirukkovil. Towards the end of June the STF 
  command at Pottuvil sent a message through a senior government official, that 
  it was safe for the people to go back and that they would be protected. The 
  people did go with hesitation and shortly after their return, the STF did a 
  round up and took all their young men away. The people had no one to complain 
  to. The government official who had persuaded them to go had himself remained 
  behind in Thirukkovil. Stricken with terror, the people fled back to Thirukkovil. 
  The young men have since not been heard of.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>A grieving mother said,&#148;Oh God, why did I go back to 
  pottuvil? I had three sons and lost them, and am back to being a refugee.&#148; 
  The southern press has hailed the return of tourists to pottuvil as a restoration 
  of normality, and have published of tourists on the beach and of President Premadasa 
  switching on a new electrification scheme. The Tamils have become the lost 
  and forgotten natives of pottuvil.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Mavai S.Senathirajah: More than 2,500 Tamil and Muslims civilians 
  have been killed in the East since the withdrawal of the IPKF. The LTTE had 
  left Trincomalee town on 13<sup>th</sup> June. But on the 14<sup>th</sup> and 
  15<sup>th</sup> when the army and the police entered town, shops and houses 
  were looted and burnt up to Gopalapuram in Trincomalee town. These same forces 
  killed and burnt 60 Tamil persons in city. 23 persons at Chelvanayakapuram, 
  42 at sittur, 25 to 75 at Thambalakamam and 12 at Chinabay were killed and 
  burnt. Even children 12 and 13 years old were killed.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>The soldiers who entered Trincomalee town took a large number 
  of women and about 58 men to the Muttaveli esplanade, and several of them were 
  murdered. Women whose blouses were torn and with their eyes tied were led to 
  the army camp. What became of them is not known. At kattaiparichchan and Mutur,230 
  bodies were seen in a burnt state and hundreds of Tamils were missing according 
  to reports.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>Mr. K. Premachandran added that persons roaming around Trincomalee

  done by an armed Muslim gang against harmony between and Muslims.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>Following the attack on the community of snake charmers,8 
  members with serious injuries were admitted to the Thriukkovil Hospital. The

<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><span> </span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>The Island of 9<sup>th</sup> August carried as its leading 
  item the killings of 57 Sinhalese in two separate incidents. The victims are 
  said to have been hacked to death and included at least 20 women, an off duty 
  soldier and children. The report said:</p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&#147;On the Mahadivulweva-Rotaweva road yesterday 
  &#145;Tigers&#146; bombed a private bus on its way from Morawewa to Horowpatana 
  before dragging people out and shooting them at point blank range and running 
  into the jungle. Twenty five persons including 14 women were killed. Seven 
  people with serious knife and gunshot injuries were rushed to hospitals by the 
  police who rushed to the scene of the gruesome massacre...People who escaped 
  death said that at least 40 &#145;Tigers&#148; were involved in the attacked.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>&#147; With yesterday&#146;s massacre tension was rising in the area.</span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>Transport had come to a standstill with people keeping off the roads fearing 
  more raids in the area.</span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&#147;Another 32 Sinhalese were hacked to death in 
  the remote jungle village of Bandaraduwa in the Uhana police area, Amparai District 
  on Tuesday (7<sup>th</sup>) night. Four others critically injured were admitted 
  to hospitals in Amparai and Colombo.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>According to police investigations, terrorists had entered 
  the village clad in uniforms similar to those of the army and attacked the inmates 
  of houses with long handed kathi knives. About one hundred terrorists had taken 
  part in the in human attack the report said. It is alleged that this attack 
  was by the Tigers from a Tiger camp set in the upper reaches of an ancient tank 
  min Nawagiriya, a few miles from this jungle village&#148;.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB style='font-weight:normal'>The report also 
  added that the scene of the incident was visited by senior police officials 
  including Chandra Fernando, D.I.G.Eastern Province and that 30 of the victims 
  were given a state burial attended by two Ministers, including the Minister 
  for Defence.</span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>Two aspects are worth nothing. The Sinhalese being killed 
  are some of the most underprivileged in this country with no particular grievance 
  against Tamils. They are placed in vulnerable situations through the chauvinistic 
  dictates of the state, under political conditions where they and the local Tamils 
  naturally fear each other. State funerals and visits by top officials are a 
  poor substitute for the raw deal given them by the state. The other aspect 
  is the contrast with the treatment given to Tamil victims and the reporting 
  of such. </p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>The Island of 10<sup>th</sup> August reported the killing 
  of 8 sinhalese living in railway line rooms at Nawagama, a border village 12 
  miles south of Vauvniya. Nilmini, a 17 year old girl who was injured had died 
  after admission to Anuradhapura hospital. Among the dead were one railway labourer 
  and other who had fled vavuniya.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>These were about the last major killings of Sinhalese reported 
  in August. The Island of 28<sup>th</sup> carried this curious report:</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>&#147;Four villagers of Dematawewa and Halmillakanda in the 
  Horowapatana police area were abducted by Tigers on Monday (27<sup>th</sup>) 
  and released the same evening ordering them to evacuate two villages within 
  24 hours. A group of 5 armed LTTEers, who had carried out the abduction had 
  also obtained from the captives information regarding police and army deployments 
  in the areas...&#148;police and army deployments were said to have been beefed 
  up after the incident.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>While the LTTE leadership views massacres tactically and 
  has a basically chauvinistic line towards Sinhalese, It would be wrong to blame 
  all killings as coming directly from orders from the top. One must also look 
  into the possibility of there being a strong element of local tensions arising 
  from colonization and traditional fears exacerbated by war and the activities 
  of the army. There have been periods when the LTTE had co-existed with these 
  villagers. The last report may be an indication that following bad publicity 
  resulting from massacres, an order may have gone out to handle Sinhalese civilians 
  differently. Even if that is the case, it is difficult to predict what would 
  happen when there is a qualitative change in the situation.</p>

name="_Toc515633804"><span>2.4 More on the Kattankudy Massascre:</span></a><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-family:"Times New Roman";'></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>In a statement issued by the federation of Kattankudy Mosques 
  and Muslim Institutions, and signed by its secretary Mr. M.K.M.Aliyar 
  it is stated that 101 Muslims were killed and 80 injured during the attack on 
  the two Mosque on 3<sup>rd</sup> August. It also stated that an LTTE member 
  Nagarajah alias Ranjith Appah played a leading role in the attack and that several 
  villagers were eyewitnesses to it.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>The statement issued on 5<sup>th</sup> August was in response 
  to denial made by Karikalan, the LTTE&#146;s political commander for Batticaloa, 
  and broadcast over the BBC&#146;s Tamil service the previous day. The statement, 
  hand written in Tamil, is the kind indignant response one would expect from 
  villagers angered by the denial. </p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>The statement further went on to say that on 12<sup>th</sup> 
  July, a convoy of vehicals with 242 persons and 5 million rupees worth of goods 
  was detained by the LTTE. The villagers, it said , approached Ranjith Appah 
  who was well known in kattankudy, who in turn promised to release the people. 
  Instead, the statement went on, the people were massacred and the 6 lorries 
  and 4 vans were burnt.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>A Muslim public servant from Kattankudy who was contacted 
  vouched for the second incident and said that the list of persons missing is 
  still being compiled and at present number\s about 170. Asked whether the victims 
  were home guards as some have alleged, the public servant said emphatically 
  that they were civilians and that his relations had been among the victims.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>One aspect of the reporting which puzzled Tamils from the 
  East was that Ranjith Appah was not a military man to lead an incursion into 
  an area under army control, and had the LTTE wished to deny its involvement 
  it would not have used a man well known in kattankudy who had a prominent squint. 
  Ranjith was chiefly a tax collector. Sources in neighboring Tamil villages 
  have since said that the LTTE was involved and that Ranjith had been present.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>It thus suggests itself that Ranjith was a guide rather than 
  the leader and that no though had been given to concealment. The denial was 
  an afterthought following the top leadership&#146;s realization of the gravity 
  of the consequences. It is very likely, as the Defence Minister had stated 
  in parliament quoting intelligence reports, that the top leadership had not 
  been apprised before hand.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>The attack can then be attributed to localized anger between 
  Tamils and MUslims which the government had used every opportunity to promote. 
  A feature which again puzzled many was the fact that the attack on the Mosques 
  co-incided with the Defence Minister&#146;s trip to Middle-East countries, including 
  Iraq and Libya to seek military help in its war with the LTTE. More than 1000 
  Tamil boys were missing or had been killed in the neighboring towns of Batticaloa, 
  Kalmunai and Karaitivu due to military action organized in such a way that Muslims 
  would be blamed.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>The intervention of the state in 1984 to deepen Tamil-Muslim 
  suspicion for its own ends was such that, to local Tamil minds, the sanctity 
  of a Mosque as a place of worship had been diluted. There is a history which 
  complicates reporting in the East. Attacks on Mosques which may come as a shock 
  to an outsider may not sound so extreme to local Tamils.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>A Tamil who lived near the Kattankudy, Navatkudah border 
  testified to an experience in 1985. After night prayers at the Mosque a call 
  made over its hailer said that Muslims were being attacked, and called upon 
  Muslims to lay hands on any weapon at their disposal and come to the Mosque 
  in haste. After some time the resident saw an armoured car followed by a crowd. 
  Tamils in the area fled as their homes were attacked. The person leading in 
  the armoured car was identified as piyasena. Piyasena and Upul were two policemen 
  in the Special Investigations Unit who became notorious over the disappearance 
  of several Tamil boys. A senior citizen in Batticaloa who related this incident, 
  said that he had personally gone to the Kattankudy border to retrieve the dead 
  body of a tamil. The fact that a Mosque was used in such a manner does not 
  cast an aspersion on Islam, but testifies to the degrading character of the 
  state&#146;s intentions, calling for greater alertness from both Tamils and 
  Muslims. To place matters in context, the manner in which the influence and 
  authority of the Church has been misused during the last decade of our national 
  crisis, is something that should be of great concern to christians. It has 
  diluted the standing of every Church as a holy place.</p>

  August:</span></a><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-family:"Times New Roman";'></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>The massacre of Muslims at Eravur was described in the Island 
  of 13<sup>th</sup> August. This was the first of its reports during the war 
  with direct reference to killings of Tamils without the normal adjectives. 
  It is said that about 200 &#145;Tigers&#146; armed with razors and automatics 
  took part in the attack in the villages of Saddam Hussein Village, Pooaikadu 
  and Kalawaichnai in the Muslim division of Eravur electorate. The attack began 
  at 9.00 pm an the 11<sup>th</sup> and went on until the early hours of the 12<sup>th</sup>. 

  Many of the victims are said to have been decapitated.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>The report also quoted a TELO source to the effect that 8 
  Tamils warded in Eravur hospital were killed by armed men who raided the hospital. 
  According to other sources, this incident preceded the massacre. The report 
  added: &#147;At Chenkaladi, close to a rice mill at least 50 Tamils including 
  many women were killed by a gang of armed men, TELO sources further said. The 
  bodies of victims were reported to have been set on fire by the killers, the 
  sources said: &#147;At Sammanthurai, seven muslims described as peasant were 
  shot by Tigers on the same day while 3 other Muslims were killed at Akkaraipattu 
  where many Tamils and Muslims were killed during the past few weeks of bloody 
  violence. The Tigers were shot dead by the police.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>&#147;At Weeramunai yesterday (12<sup>th</sup>) morning armed 
  men raided a refugee camp and slaughtered 24 men and women. At least 40 suffered 
  serious injuries. The Special Task Force (STF) men were yesterday scheduled 
  to escort about 2000 Tamils at Akkaraipattu....&#148; </p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>Fr. Selvarajah was among those killed at Weeramunai. Mr.Alagakoon, 
  brother of the veteran UNP Minister, K.W.Devanayagam was knifed to death at 
  Chenkalady. Though there was direct reference to Tamils killed for the first 
  time, the reporting was silent or vague on many questions. The killers involved 
  had to be Tigers on the one hand and unidentified persons on the other. At 
  the time of writing we have (because of our own limitations) received no independent 
  confirmation that the Tigers were involved in the Eravur massacre. According 
  to one source from Eravur, the killers went along calling people in Sinhalese 
  and shooting or killing whoever they accosted. There also some village talk 
  that Ranjith Appah was seen. It appears that the reason for identifying the 
  killers as Tigers is mainly circumstantial. Tigers had been identified as killers 
  of Muslims in many other instances. Even if other parties, such as the state, 
  found it in their interests to kill Muslims directly and blame the LTTE, the 
  risk of being found out and the consequent liabilities were both high. This 
  country has never had a reputation for keeping secrets, no thanks to the press. 
  Whether it is the killers of Richard de Zoysa or the perpetrators of the Anuradhapura 
  massacre, within a matter of days or weeks, the most awkward details become 
  subjects of drawing room talk.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>Why did the Muslim Congress say in its statement that &#147;the 
  massacre of Eravur Muslims is raising the doubt whether the LTTE is going ahead 
  with its barbaric attacks on the Muslims with the connivance of the government&#148;? 
  The answer probably lies in what the army was doing. The report quoted also 
  said: &#147;Many bodies were recovered by soldiers who arrived in Eravur from 
  Batticaloa and Chenkalady to help people bury their relatives&#148;. The report 
  had earlier said that the attack went on into the early hours of the following 
  day. The massacre which began at 9.00 pm had gone on for more than 3 hours 
  and the army from the Chenkalady-Eravur border area had come the following morning. 
  The explanation that the army is afraid to get out in the nights is human and 
  plausible. If one cannot expect more from a professional army, it makes the 
  recruitment of home guards all the more questionable. The motive has evidently 
  little to do with the protection of the people. Who had been responsible for 
  the killing of 8 or 9 Tamils at Eravur hospital prior to the massacre? Muslims 
  living with Tamils have asked home guards not to come any where near.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>About this time it became clear that the SLMC leader Mr.Ashraff 
  had begun distancing himself from the government, whose kind intentions towards 
  Muslims, became more doubtful. The government signalled its annoyance at the 
  SLMS not towing the line by refusing Mr. Ashraff a seat on the flight which 
  flew Muslim dignitaries from Colombo in to Eravur as part of the propaganda 
  exercise. Ar. Ashraff is a native of Eravur. We call it a propaganda exercise, 
  because not only was similar consideration not paid to the Tamil dead, but also 
  the matter was officially denied. About this time SLMC members in Colombo were 
  arrested and harassed. </p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>In the following days the sun and the Island newspapers claimed 
  that 75 and 89 Tamils had been killed respectively. The official denial was 
  published in the Daily News. Minister Wijeratne said that members of the Batticaloa 
  citizens&#146; committee who had been taken to Chenkalady by the army had failed 
  to find evidence. This is hardly surprising. The truth, as far as we have 
  been able to verify, is that a large number of Tamils had been killed and the 
  rest had mostly scattered. For this reason the compilation of the list of dead 
  persons is still going on slowly, with official hostility rather than help.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>On the other hand there is little mystery about the identity 
  of the &#147;armed persons&#148; responsible for killing the Tamils. This happened 
  in the morning after the army found itself able to leave the camp. Men in army 
  uniform had gone house by house pulling people out. One such armed person came 
  into a house and found 15 boys in a bedroom. He asked them to quickly get into 
  the kitchen. He then outside and shouted to someone who made an inquiry, &#147;Mehe 
  Kowruth nehe&#148; [&#148;There is nobody here&#148;]. The 15 escaped later.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>A postscript to the incident exemplifies the folly of lying 
  through the media and of denying the obvious. A boy from Chenkalady, now living 
  in Germany, made a frantic call to this country. In a video shown in Germany 
  of the damaged and looted houses that his parents had fled their home in Chenkalady 
  and were living with relatives in Batticaloa. On the other hand, concern for 
  the Tamils and balanced reporting by the state, would have largely eliminated 
  the possibility of biased reporting by either side for propaganda and collection 
  of funds. There is a desultory game being played in the East at great cost 
  to the people by both sides. Its rule is: If you go into one village with a 
  gun, you them go into the next village with a video camera.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Mahesan from puloly regarded by many of his colleagues as 
  being, by far ,the most brilliant amongst the first batch of science graduates 
  from the University of Jaffna, who were admitted in 1974. Mahesan had little 
  interest in politics and life was a sad one. His family was poor and his father 
  committed suicide when he was to sit for his last paper at the A levels. His 
  results were otherwise brilliant. He obtained 1<sup>st</sup> class honours 
  for his general degree. His knowledge of the subject matter was so through 
  that he spent most of his time in explanations to his fellow students. His 
  family&#146;s circumstances made him seek employment in Nigeria from where he 
  proceeded to the USA for doctoral studies in Statistics. Now, being a families 
  man, he returned home before submitting his doctoral thesis. He applied for 
  temporary employment in the universities of Jaffna and Batticaloa and was accepted 
  in the latter. From Batticaloa he was to travel to Jaffna on 16<sup>th</sup> 
  June to face an interview for a temporary appointment at the University of Jaffna. 
  The war began on 11<sup>th</sup> June and a ceasefire was declared on the 13<sup>th</sup>. 
  Mahesan travelled from Chenkaladi to Batticaloa to reserve a seat on a coach 
  going to Jaffna. On his way back, the van was stopped by LTTE cadre who hitched 
  a ride. This was spotted by an airforce helicopter which followed the van and 
  opened fire. Obviously, the LTTE cadre had seen the helicopter and not expect 
  to be attacked in view of the ceasefire. The passengers took shelter under 
  a tree. Mashesan was killed by a bullet in the abdomen. Such callousness by 
  the air force towards civilians travelling in vehicles was to become a regular 
  feature of the war.</p>

  Trincomalee</span></a><span> </span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>It will be clear from our reports that Tamils in these parts 
  are living in state of terror, with many killed and most of them refugees. 

  The pattern suggests that this is a part of deliberate policy. It come as no 
  surprise that attempts are underway to settle or resettle Sinhalese in these 
  areas, with state aid and promised protection. In the meantime Tamils continue 
  to disappear or live in the disease and neglect of refugee camps. The Island 
  of 22<sup>nd</sup> August carried the following:</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>&#147;About 250 Sinhalese families who had been almost languishing 
  in refugee camps in Trincomalee town for the past three years, have now been 
  resettled in the villages in the Trincomale District which they deserted due 
  to conditions at that time. The first batch of refugees to be resettled had 
  come from Sirimapura numbering 140...Each of these families was given Rs.1,000 
  worth of kitchen utensils, other household items and dry rations at a simple 
  ceremony by K.B.Wijekoon, Government Agent, Trincomalee. They were also given 
  items like pillows and mats by the Sarvodaya representative in the Trincomalee 
  District, Anne Dissanayake. Pipeborn water and electricity have been provided 
  to some of the resettlement homes and in the case of others, steps are now being 
  taken to provide them.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB style='font-weight:normal'>&#147;These villagers 
  got aid in the from of cadjans, tiles, cement and other items of building materials 
  from donors in various parts of the island...&#148;</span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>The Daily News of the same day added: </p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&#147;Minister of State for Defence Mr.Ranjan Wijeratne 
  during his tour of Trincomalee on the 18<sup>th</sup> visited those who had 
  been resettled at Sirimapura. Army,Navy,Airforce and Police Officers and GA 
  Trincomalee, K.B.Wijekoon accompanied him...He went round to see the workmen 
  from Kurunegala District renovating damaged house at Sirimapura on a voluntary 
  basis. They sent here by the Chief Minister of the NW province Mr. Gamini Jayawicrama 
  Perera...&#148;</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>The blatantly discriminatory manner in which the state machinery 
  is at work shows an instinctive chauvinistic drive towards an objective. Sarvodaya 
  is of course a well-funded NGO, avowedly Gandhian and careful in its diplomacy, 
  but not well known for a position that could be called principled or courageous. 
  Its position on Tamil refugees in Trincomalee has not been reported. </p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>There is no accountability where Tamil representatives can 
  check what exactly is going on. Existing Sinhalese settlements were made under 
  questionable conditions on land encroached with state connivance, often under 
  cover of racial violence. We do not make distinctions between human beings 
  and we live in a world where the movement of human beings and exposure to other 
  cultures is accepted as being healthy. Many Tamils too would welcome Sinhalese 
  living in the North-East under conditions where racial politics had been marginalised 
  and where accountability and equality in the functioning of the state can be 
  secured. At present the conditions are deteriorating very much in the opposite 
  direction. The political motivation can only be termed diabolical by its effects.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB style='font-weight:normal'>Anyone who cares 
  genuinely for these Sinhalese settlers must ask:</span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>Are they placed in conditions where they can live as healthy 
  human beings? Are practical conditions being secured where they can live in 
  good neighbourliness? What are the prospects of their children entering university 
  in a country that boasts of universal free education?</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>We know that they live in squalor, cynically inducted into 
  a paramilitary culture, hated by their neighbours as much as they hate their 
  neighbours. Indeed at every bout of anti-Tamil rioting, they were encouraged 
  to attack their neighbours under military protection-a treatment which the Tamil 
  groups returned when the IPKE arrived. They are victims of decadent uncaring 
  nationalism. It comes as no surprise that such scheme should be undertaken 
  by the same state that has killed Sinhalese relentlessly in the South-a state 
  and ruling class equally cynical of the Sinhalese poor as of the Tamil people.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The Sunday Times of 26<sup>th</sup> August published a full 
  page article with the title above, by Malinga Herman Gunaratne, author of &#147;For 
  a Sovereign state&#148;, published by Sarvodaya printers. the article concerned 
  the subject of his book, of breaking the contiguity of the Tamil region by planting 
  Sinhalese settlements. The plan of settlements on the Yan Oya and Malwathu 
  Oya was worked out before the 1983 communal riots, by what are described as 
  &#145;some of the keenest minds&#146; in the Mahaveli Ministry, now holding 
  international positions. The secret operation was scuttled by President J.R.Jayawardena 
  whose son supported these settlements. Some senior persons in the ministry, 
  including the author lost their jobs and Gamini Dissanayake, the minister concerned, 
  was reprimanded. The author feels keenly the long hours of incarceration in 

  dark, dank police cells-nothing compared with what his friend Ravi&#146;s paramilitary 
  forces did first to Tamil and then extended Sinhalese boys. The Sunday Times 
  introduces the article as a first person account of the plan...(and in keeping 

  with its editorial suggestions of using military advantage to settle the land 
  questions), whether such an operation cannot still be mounted, this time with 
  official blessings.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>The fact that Jayawardene . no friend of the Tamils, had 
  to act as he did suggests that the plan was blatantly loony as it was racist. 
  The plan was calculated to make Sri Lanka a permanent issue in Indian politics, 
  giving India and Tamil Nadu stronger grounds for legitimate leverage in local 
  affairs, than had the &#145;83 riots. Indeed, the president&#146;s action suggests 
  strong Indian protest. As past events, as well as today&#146;s, poignantly 
  make explicit, the execution of such a plan requires genocide, at least on a 

  limited scale. The fact that the July 1983 racial violence proved an appropriate 
  setting for the plan make that clear:</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>&#147;The riots had set the stage for a tide of nationalism. 
  Some 45,000 flocked to the Maduru Oya in search of the promised land...Our first 
  proposal was only to place a few settlers as deterrent against illegal encroachments 
  by Tamil separatists.&#148;</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>The Tamil militancy was weak at that time, and was in no 
  position to help Tamil encroaches. In fact Tamil victims from the 1977 violence 
  from the South who had settled in Pankulam, were driven away quite simply, by 
  the AGA walking in with a few others and setting fire their huts, shortly before 
  the 1983 anti-Tamil violence. Under cover of this violence several Tamil victims 
  from 1977 in these areas were rounded up, taken to the hill country, and dumped 
  amidst the 1983 violence.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB style='font-weight:normal'>The 45,000 were 
  not moving spontaneously into Maduru Oya with nationalist fervor, as the article 
  later admits:</span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>&#147;We conceived and implemented a plan which we though 
  would secure the territorial integrity of Sri Lanka for a long time. We moved 
  a large group of 45,000 land-hungry peasants into the Batticaloa and Polonnaruwa 
  districts of the Maduru Oya delta. The second step was to make a similar human 
  settlement in the Yan Oya basin. The third step was going to be a settlement 
  of a number of people, opposed to &#147;Eelam&#148; on the Malwathu Oya. He 
  claims that his group was responsible for the Weli-Oya settlement, separating 
  Mullaitivu and Trincomalee districts. </p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>The article also presents a colored photograph of Ravi Jayawardene 
  with Moshe Levy, recipient of the Star of David, suggesting Israeli inspiration 
  behind the plan. It also reminds a person, mischievously perhaps, that Premadasa 
  is the man who threw out the Israelis, much to the chagrin of an section of 
  the ruling party, who looked upon Israelis as good friends. Behind the propaganda 
  thrust represented by the article, one cannot dismiss the possibility of a power 
  struggle within the ruling party.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>The views of the author of this article are not those of 
  an isolated individual of questionable sanity. The publicity enjoyed by his 
  views suggests that influential persons are helping him to by the author and 
  his own article indicate that his views command considerable influence within 
  the armed forces. The author is at pains to disclaim originality for the ideas. 
  It is logical expression of the instinctive chauvinism of the ruling elite. 
  It represents their idea of how a united Sri Lanka can be preserved within their 
  overlordship. Settlers are pawns to them. The author is a planter, a respectable 
  alternative to an army career for mission school boys. An argument offered 
  for these land settlements is land hunger in the South with its vast tea, rubber 
  and coconut plantations. The declining prices of these products on the international 
  market make their continuance questionable, against pressure for land redistribution. 
  To make matters worse, the UNP which held power for over 10 years has even taken 
  over peasant lands in the South and given them over to sugar multinationals 
  for questionable returns. This is how killing disenchanted Sinhalese in the 
  South and setting others in Tamil areas are two sides of the same coin. The 
  author indirectly appeals for support for his plan to the Minister for Defence, 
  himself an ex-planter.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>Variations of the author&#146;s plan have ben in execution 
  for some time without being so explicitly stated. Senior citizens of Trincomalee 
  who have been watching with concern for several years would tell you that. 
  Unfortunately, out of the few able spokesmen the Trincomalee Tamils had, some 
  were killed in political rivalry and a drive for influence by Tamil group within 
  the last two years. Nearly every ministry and every government corporation 
  operating in Trincomalee has been devoting resources to settling Sinhalese, 
  whether directly or indirectly-Ministry of ports, Ministry of Industries and 
  Scientific Affairs, Ministry of Tourism, Cashew Corporation etc. Thus the plan 
  represents the instinctive thrust of the whole government machinery, inclusive 

  of the armed forces, to the point of becoming institutionalized. Official with 
  sober views have ceased to count, and indeed even Tamil officials who share 
  the anxieties of their fellows, have become integrated into the system. </p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>Genocide is a logical consequence of this ideological thrust 
  though perhaps in a limited form. At some point state sponsored induction of 
  Sinhalese in a politically hostile environment would threaten the Tamils and 
  Muslims, first in the milder form of encroaching on their lands. A ministry 
  by gazette notification designates a piece of land as being taken over either 
  for a tourist resort, to build quarters for employees, for the use of Prima 
  Flour mills or for some such purpose. The squatter colony of Sirimapura suddenly 
  springs up on a piece of land belonging to the municipality. One way or the 
  other locals lose land-it may be personal property, temple property or public 
  property used by locals. Where there were disputes, law courts had long ceased 
  to be of much use, but the Sinhalese had the police, the army and the navy. 
  The Tamil boys in 1983 assuaged their helpless anger by going for training arms 
  by the hundreds. Next, the forces behaved as though every Tamil was a terrorist. 
  At this point we were on the slippery slope towards genocide. During the current 
  war, a close look at events would reveal both a qualitative as well as a quantitative 
  difference between massacres by the state forces and those by the LTTE. The 
  latter reveal a strong component of localized anger and insecurity felt by local 
  Tamils, and have the character of spontaneous communal violence. The former 
  act on orders from Colombo and the manner in which Muslims have been used strongly 
  suggests a powerful element of per-meditation. Figures complied by local citizens 
  reveal irreplaceable losses to the strengths of tamil communities in vulnerable 
  places- About 200 killed and missing in Karaitivu, 500 in Kalmunai, 400 in Batticaloa, 
  several hundreds in Trincomalee, next to no Tamils remaining in Pottuvil with 
  the young men taken by the STF. In some places, such as Akkaraipattu, those 
  singled out for killing include leaders of the local community. Then there 
  is the manner in which the state machinery is setting Sinhalese while the Tamils 
  are totally beaten. All this suggests a pattern. It is the only possible logical 
  execution of Herman Gunaratne&#146;s plan.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>Where it will lead the country to is not hard to imagine. 
  We must question not only the saintly of one individual, but of the whole ruling 
  class. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><u><span lang=EN-GB style='font-weight:normal'>Batticaloa, 
  4<sup>th</sup> September:</span></u><span> </span>Three girls were shot dead 
  near the Batticaloa railway station on the 4<sup>th</sup> night. One girl was 
  the sister-in-law of David, member of the TELO. The girl&#146;s mother was 
  taken off a Colombo bound bus by the LTTE during July. The dead girl, David&#146;s 
  wife&#146;s elder sister, had reported the mother&#146;s abduction to the ICRC. 
  The mother is since missing. According to rumour, the other two girls are said 
  to have &#145;misbehaved&#146; with the many.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><u><span lang=EN-GB style='font-weight:normal'>Batticaloa, 
  28<sup>th</sup> December 1989:</span></u> 65 members of the Tamil National Army 
  (TNA) are reported to have been buried in one huge pit at Nallathanni Madu, 
  Muhattuvaram. The victims had surrendered to the LTTE and a were being held 
  prisoners. Prior to burial, their hands were tied and some were alive while 
  some had been shot. Vehicles were then run over the grave. The incident was 
  reported by two independent witnesses and is distinct from the killing of about 
  75 TNA prisoners shortly after the LTTE took over Batticaloa on 14<sup>th</sup> 
  December 1989, backed by the Sri Lankan Army.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><u><span lang=EN-GB style='font-weight:normal'>Casualty figures,

<p class=MsoBodyText>Karaitivu, June: Following the appearance of 27 headless 
  bodies washed ashore on the Kalmunai beach in June, the STF and the army addressed 
  Karaitivu citizens. The citizens were told that 2 Muslims who had been responsible 
  for these bodies had been taken in with several identity cards. Appropriate 
  action was promised.<a href="#_Toc515633798">[Top]</a></p>
