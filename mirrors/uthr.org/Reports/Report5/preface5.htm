<p class=MsoHeading7 align="center"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><a name="_Toc515632303"><span lang=EN-GB>PREFACE</span></a></font></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The UTHR [Jaffna] 
  became better organized<b> </b>over the last few weeks. Information was transmitted 
  until the new military offensive of 23<sup>rd</sup> August, with the aim of 
  relieving the Jaffna Fort. Information with regard to the situation in Jaffna 
  collected by members of the university community together with Pax Christi, 
  was published in our Special Report No.1. We also received help from students 
  in reporting on the situation in the East.</font></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In addition to 
  reporting on events, the current report also gives reflections of our members 
  on issues which will deeply concern those organizations working towards restoring 
  peace. We argue from experience that a ceasefire which merely seeks to end 
  the fighting without the enforcement of human rights and lay the foundation 
  for the people to participate in deciding their future, would only lead to worse 
  disasters. As an organization, the UTHR [Jaffna] suffered its greatest loss 
  when Dr. Rajani Thiranagama was murdered just after the announcement of a ceasefire. 
  The first anniversary of her death falls soon on 21<sup>st</sup> September.</font></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Concerning a ceasefire 
  and the allied question of rehabilitation, we hold that it is important to look 
  into the legitimacy of the parties concerned. We contend that no party can 
  claim legitimacy unless it arises through a broadly democratic process. In 
  the absence of that the parties cannot deliver the goods they know are necessary, 
  and their moves will be governed by the need to survive in power, whatever the 
  cost to the people. Events in this country bear ample testimony to that. 
   </font></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">What we want from 
  our friends is not to decide, directly or de facto, which party represents the 
  Tamils or who represents the Sinhalese. But we would like, and do need help, 
  to establish conditions for people&#146;s participation in deciding their future. 
  To act as though a people is represented by persons who regularly perform detestable 
  acts is damaging in many ways. For one thing, such representatives can in practice 
  deliver very little that they promise in their rational moments and frustrate 
  most attempts at helping the people. Another is that such associations diminish 
  the humanity of the people. Once it is assumed that the natural representatives 
  of the Tamil people perform inhuman acts, it is easy to justify bombings and 
  massacres of Tamils. Similarly, to assume that a legitimate government of the 
  Sinhalese can only carry on by regularly exterminating hundreds and thousands 
  of Sinhalese, carries terrible and totally unjustified assumptions about the 
  Sinhalese people. The problem we are posing is not an academic one, but concerns 
  life and death.</font></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In this respect, 
  we must also ask our friends to be alert about the kind of reporting that is 
  done on events here. Tamil civilians are often questioned following the impact 
  of something traumatic, such as aerial attacks unleashed by the state. In 
  their helplessness and anger, people may come out with expressions of support 
  for the only force they see as standing between themselves and the state. Even 
  otherwise in a culture of terror where the people are powerless, it is commonplace 
  and instinctive for people to talk in order to survive. When casual assessments 
  are made about the kind of leadership the Tamils desire, it trivialises both 
  the tamil people and their aspirations.</font></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">On the other hand, 
  to understand the people&#146;s feelings at some depth, some of the questions 
  to ask are: Are they moving towards the kind of future they want for their children? 
  Why are people trying to send their children abroad rather than accede to the 
  demand of the leaders to fight to the finish? Is it pure selfishness? Does 
  it help Tamil interests to have themselves identified as supporting the killing 
  of Sinhalese and Muslims? </font></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">What went wrong 
  if the Tamils were reported to have desired the departure of the IPKF a year 
  ago and want India to intervene now?</font></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Such questions, 
  to which answers would reveal a complex phenomenon, are seldom asked. It becomes 
  only too easy to assume that people in the third world like to have some peculiar 
  leaders, while for the Germans to have a like Hitler was an aberration. While 
  a concerted effort was made after the second world war to ensure that the socio-economic 
  factors which were conducive to the rise of Hitler do not recur in Germany, 
  the real needs of the third world lie buried below comfortable assumptions. 
  </font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"></font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><a name="_Toc515632304"><span lang=EN-GB>ABOUT 
  THE WAR</span></a><span> </span></font></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">On the government&#146;s 
  part, it is acting with greater license against Tamils than what it would have 
  found difficult to justify in 1987, as the massacres in the East would testify. 
  The unstated policy that is in operation now in the East, is the old one of 
  marginalising Tamil influence through a mixture of terror and state sponsored 
  colonization. The reader should weigh the evidence. The aerial strafing of 
  starving civilians in Jaffna seeking food and shelter is given legal sanction 
  through curfews. These are not curfews imposed for the safety of occupying 
  troops, but are supervised from the air. Despite the weeks of time available, 
  no moves were made by the government to seek the help of the ICRC and of civilian 
  organizations to organize centres where people can be sheltered and fed without 
  being molested from air or land. In normal times feeding the people of Jaffna 
  requires 100 lorry loads or 500 tons of food stuff a day. Figures available 
  with government will show that only a small fraction of this has been getting 
  through for the last 3 months. It is dishonest for the government to evade 
  this fact by accusing the Tigers of black marketeering. It is plainly inhuman 
  to restrict the movement of civilians under such conditions, whose other alternative 
  is to starve. The description of the bombing as a policy of destroying the 
  concept of a Tamil homeland by bombing the house of Tamils, as a parliamentarian 
  put it, does not appear to be far from the truth. It is hard to imagine how 
  such a policy could have been justified in human terms, even against an alien 
  people.</font></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Visitors and human 
  rights activists from overseas who came to this country were deeply shocked, 
  that local NGO&#146;s and churches were carrying on with almost total insensitivity 
  to the fact that their own country men in this small island were being bombed 
  by their own government. They appeared oblivious to sitting on a powder keg 
  themselves, where the lid was being pressed down hard on anger iniquity seething 
  below.</font></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">On the LTTE&#146;spart, 
  there is reason to believe, that out of tactical considerations at least, the 
  leadership is not keen on news of massacres of Muslims and Sinhalese. </font></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">faced with a disillusioned 
  Tamil people, the LTTE has to depend more on overseas publicity of the government&#146;s 
  atrocities _ with which the government, as always, is readily obliging. But 
  what happens on the ground reveals either a lack of clarity in its thinking, 
  or both. The events in Kalmunai during June represent a scenario that has been 
  repeated again and again during the struggle.</font></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Prior to the massacre 
  of the policemen,11 soldiers in a group that had come to buy vegetables in Kalmunai 
  were killed. The civilian population itself was disgusted with the manner in 
  which their bodies were desecrated and dragged with ropes. They were lying 
  in public places for six days, until health authorities intervened. The LTTE 
  then withdrew knowing well what would happen to the people. The voiceless people, 
  already afraid with their sense of decency violated, were left cowering in their 
  homes and refugee camps, awaiting the inevitable holocaust. A feeling, sometimes 
  unconscious, which guides such actions is that civilian deaths are good for 
  propaganda. The scenario in Trincomalee was similar. What happened was a caricature 
  of the LTTE propaganda leader Anton Balasingam&#146;s pledge, &#147;We will 
  not hesitate to take up to arms to defend our people and carry on our aims&#148;.</font></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">If the government 
  had really cared for the Tamil people or had wished to win them over, the forces 
  should have behaved in a disciplined manner. Then the people themselves would 
  have shared their feelings. Instead, their behaviour sent the survivors running 
  to the jungles, where the LTTE was, for safety. The government itself is instinctively 
  or deliberately following a course of creating conditions for justifiable genocide.</font></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">It is no use talking 
  about army psychology. The army as an institution has degenerated with the 
  political culture of this country. Prior to the slaughter of Sinhalese Youth 
  in 1971, the army was evolving under its use in breaking up the Tamil satyagraha 
  in 1961. Its subsequent history in Tamil areas in the 60&#146;s, was one of 
  increasing indiscipline and insensitivity to the law.</font></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">What has become 
  evident in the militarisation of the Sri Lankan state during the last decade, 
  and its increasing complacency with indiscriminate killing, is that it now feels 
  itself strong enough to disregard international human rights pressure. This 
  illusion of strength is supported by the approbation or silence of nearly all 
  persons and institutions of influence. This is why the government&#146;s efforts 
  to promote the LTTE as every one&#146;s common enemy must be resisted. This 
  alluring notion has cast a veil over what is being done to the Tamil people 
  by the state. The fact that the government which embraced and strengthened 
  the LTTE can now bomb the Tamils on the absurd grounds that they are harbouring 
  the LTTE is an example of how external interference can make the people powerless. 
  The LTTE must be confronted for what it stands by the Tamil people. The requires 
  sympathetic external pressure of the kind that will help the people to find 
  a voice in their destiny. </font></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">For the moment 
  government will continue in its disastrous course thinking itself strong. The 
  truth is that it is faced with economic disaster, a Sinhalese people tired of 
  war drums and an army showing signs of weariness with the political leadership. 
  [See Appendix II]. The annual cost to the country of the Middle East crisis 
  is put at US $500 million. The government will go on playing with the war, 
  unable to win and lacking the will to seek a political solution. soldiers marching 
  through manifolds will not relish the thought that their leaders gave the LTTE 
  7 tons of explosives, over 2000 AK-47&#146;S, several lakhs of ammunition rounds 
  and several hundred LMG&#146;S. (Karunakaran M.P.in parliament, 19<sup>th</sup> 
  July and other sources). [This makes it even more unlikely that a surrender 
  of arms by the LTTE was part of the LTTE-Premadasa deal as the government has 
  insisted]</font></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The war will be 
  fought on crude, low cost terms. General Ranatunga told a press conference 
  (Island 31<sup>st</sup> August), &#145;In a populate area an unidentified targets 
  taken on by the pilot with great risk&#146;. (To whom?) The Defence Minister 
  added that they still do not have guided missiles. The Minister had earlier 
  made a sensational announcement in parliament that the government was setting 
  up a massive refugee camp in Vavuniya to accommodate the 800,000 strong population 
  in Jaffna. It was announced at the same press conference by the General that 
  the government was setting up a refugee camp in Vavuniya that would take in 
  refugees from anywhere, including Jaffna. The Rehabilitation secretary added 
  that it would take in 5,000 for a start! A rumour spread by the government through 
  a defence ministry press release that the LTTE was preventing food from getting 
  to the civilians, was denied by the ICRC in a rare press intervention. In fact 
  the army had disallowed an ICRC food convoy from diverting from a pre-assigned 
  route to avoid crossing lines of combat at Mankulam(Sun 5<sup>th</sup> September). 
  These illustrate the degree of seriousness about Tamil civilians. </font></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">There has for 
  years been a wilful blindness to the plight of Tamil civilians. during the 
  Vadamaratchi Operation of 1987, civilians who had constructed air raid shelters 
  were in may instances killed as having done it on LTTE orders. Even officers 
  spoken to could not understand the stupidity of punishing civilians.</font></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Today, when the 
  government says the LTTE is demanding 2 gold sovereigns from people, it does 
  not acknowledge the government&#146;s duty to protect people from expropriation. 
  But the context rather indicates that is an additional excuse to bomb them.</font></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">When it says that 
  Tamil children are being forced to join the LTTE &#145;s baby brigades, a duty 
  to protect children of the nation from an awful destiny is not acknowledged. 
  But its actions indicate that it feels justified in killing Tamil children.</font></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The direction 
  of the war is not towards victory, nor are there attempts to win over civilians 
  and isolate the LTTE. But it is moving towards creating conditions for justifiable 
  genocide by identifying all Tamils as terrorists. This is the logical aim and 
  culmination of the ideology which was at work during the 1983 racial violence. 
  A great misfortune of the Tamils was to have themselves, from a position of 
  weakness, given birth to an ideology which devalued life of other communities 
  as well as its own.</font></p>
