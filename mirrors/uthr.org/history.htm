    <ol>

        through a portrayal of individual characters together with an analysis 
        of social pressures and external circumstances governing their behaviour. 
        We try to show that the characters involved, even in the worst violations, 
        are often human, whose actions are governed by mislaid human potential, 
        past choices and oppressive circumstances.Its an endevour to capture a 
        narrative space for the people who were trapped in the conflict and in

        their life even without knowing our recent history, we feel it is necessary 
        to leave a record. Moreover, in this country, we seem to suffer from historical 
        amnesia combined with a moral vacuum, forcing us to re-live an unpleasant

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>S</strong>ri Lanka, once a role model for third world democracies, 
    is now for the last 20 years, a scene of obdurate violence and war ( See <a href="BP/Content.htm">Broken 
    Palmyra</a>, <a href="Rajan/selfdet.htm">The Tamil Secessionist Movement in 
    Sri Lanka (Ceylon):A Case of Secession by Default?</a> , <a href="Book/Content.htm">Sri 
    Lanka:The Arrogance of Power: Myths, Decadence &amp; Murder</a> on this site). 
    The long simmering ethnic crisis, which metamorphosed into a full-scale war, 
    has now gone through several phases. From 1956, the Tamil community was at 
    the receiving end of several bouts of ethnically motivated violence that had 
    the connivance of the State. This compounded the increasingly blatant discriminatory 
    policies of the Sri Lankan State. Ethnicisation of the political landscape 
    has resulted in a polarization that now appears difficult to disentangle. 
  </p>
  <p>The intransigence and opportunism of the Sinhalese polity in its turn gave 
    boost to an insensitive Tamil nationalist politics that was high on rhetoric. 
    The chauvinist camp among the Sinhalese capitalized on this, playing on the 
    fears of the Sinhalese. Though a majority in Sri Lanka, the Sinhalese are 
    in relation to the Tamils a minority in the region. Both communities had launched 
    into a confrontational political course and for both internal and external 
    reasons, the rights of the Tamils and their quality of life suffered progressive 
    degradation.<br>
    <br>
    The armed struggle of Tamil youth to achieve a separate state, which commenced 
    in the 1970s, attracted an unprecedented number of Tamil youth to its banner 
    following the government sponsored pogrom of July 1983 which left about 2000 
    Tamils dead. India, fearing the Sri Lankan government's canvassing of Western 
    military assistance, provided arms and training to the Tamil militants. Various 
    militant formations sprang up. The internal and internecine killings by the 
    militant groups, introduced a new horrifying dynamism that altogether changed 
    the character of the struggle.</p>
  <p>The continuing war thus resulted in the dehumanization of our society resulting 
    in a violent political culture Human rights violations are carried out by 
    all parties without any accountability ie. the state, armed militant groups 
    and paramilitary forces with the connivance of the State (<font size="+1"><b> 
    See <a href="Thuoughts.htm">some thoughts on armed oppostional groups</a>)</b></font>. 
  </p>
  <p>The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) achieved its dominance in 1986 
    after decimating other militant groups. In the meantime the Sri Lankan Army 
    gaining upper hand in consequence was on the verge of capturing Jaffna (in 
    the North).The first half of 1987 was a period of intense hostilities between 
    the Sri Lankan forces and the LTTE. Jaffna was continually subject to bombing 
    and shelling. The arrival of the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) in August 
    1987 led to a brief peace. </p>
  <p>The ordinary Tamil people had reposed hope in the direct Indian intervention 
    of 1987. That hope gave way to shock and bewilderment, when the intervention 
    failed, giving way to full-scale war. The feeling of powerlessness and nakedness 
    among the civilian community was overwhelming. At the University, a number 
    of us took the initiative to mobilize the university community to work for 
    democratic alternatives to the violent snare that was consuming us. The first 
    internal effort resulted in the book, <a href="BP/Content.htm" target="_blank">The 
    Broken Palmyra</a>, describing the plight of the people. It touched various 
    aspects of the conflict, describing the roles of all actors and was based 
    on information we were able to collect through students, colleagues and others. 
    We published the book openly putting our names to it. </p>
  <p>In the meantime unprecedented human rights violations were also occurring 
    in the South of the country in connection with the JVP uprising and the UTHR(J) 
    was born in mid-1988 as the local chapter of a countrywide organization launched 
    to address these issues. </p>
  <p>The UTHR(J) began publishing reports on human rights violations in 1988 from 
    the University of Jaffna. Although it started as a branch of the national 
    organisation, it is still continuing to function against several odds, long 
    after the national organisation ceased to function.</p>
  <p>During this period the LTTE was at war, not only with the IPKF, but with 
    all alternative voices in the Tamil community as well. In time the war displaced 
    almost two thirds of the community in the Jaffna peninsula. The LTTE engaged 
    in brutal acts of torture and assassination in its struggle for hegemony within 
    the Tamil community. The Indian army, in turn, was responsible for its own 
    brand of terror, with widespread violations and killings of civilians. The 
    few independent institutions in civil society that could have given voice 
    to the concerns of the common people were paralysed by fear.</p>
  <p>The University of Jaffna faced the challenging task of maintaining its independence 
    in the face of external and internal terror. We initiated a novel action committee 
    with support from colleagues - including academic and non-academic staff, 
    as well as students. The traditional university fora -- faculties, senate 
    and council - still functioned, but focussed narrowly on academic and administrative 
    matters. The action committee became the primary forum for addressing the 
    day-to-day problems of living with the war. It succeeded to some extent in 
    rebuilding the community spirit, at least within the university community. 
  </p>
  <p>It also sent a signal to the IPKF and the LTTE, demonstrating that the community 
    still retained a measure of dignity and courage. But while it had some effect 
    on the IPKF, the LTTE was intent on disrupting the life of the Tamil community 
    and rupturing its civil society. They came head on to suppress the University's 
    hard earned independence, in their effort to shut down all educational institutions. 
    The students, with their newly regained sense of responsibility, articulated 
    the need to keep the University open in the common interest of the community. 
    The University thus succeeded in asserting itself as an institution in which 
    alternatives could be aired openly.</p>
  <p>The new Indian government of V.P.Singh announced the withdrawal of the IPKF 
    on September 20, 1989. The very next day, we were given the most grim indicator 
    of what was to follow: The LTTE assassinated <a href="Rajani.htm">Dr.Rajani 
    Thiranagama</a>, a founder activist of the UTHR(J), the head of the Anatomy 
    Department and one of the four who co-authored 'The Broken Palmyra'. After 
    the withdrawal of the Indian forces in 1990, the LTTE became the de-facto 
    state in the Northern Province. It secured its control of Jaffna through concerted 
    suppression of internal dissent through detention, torture and executions 
    [see <a href="Reports/Report10/Report10.htm">Report 10</a>]. </p>
  <p>The war between the LTTE and the Sri Lankan forces resumed full scale in 
    June 1990 and with it the LTTE crackdown on dissent intensified. Many of those 
    associated with the UTHR(J) fled Jaffna - including the other founding members 
    of the UTHR(J) -- or ceased from open political activity. The last person 
    to remain and be openly engaged in monitoring had to leave in September 1990, 
    when there was an attempt to arrest him. All those who helped him to escape 
    were later arrested by the LTTE and imprisoned for several months.</p>
  <p>With the UTHR[J] moving operations to the South, Jaffna lost its last organisation 
    for open political dissent. There was a continuance of individual acts of 
    resistance that persevered against severe odds; but the LTTE succeeded in 
    crushing all organized collective effort.</p>
  <p>In August 1991, two students, Manoharan and Selvy (Selvanithi alias Chelvi) 
    who had been close to the UTHR(J) were detained by the LTTE and have since 
    disappeared. Chelvy was a poet and recipient of awards from International 
    Pen and Poetry International. Her disappearance attracted considerable international 
    attention, but there has been no official confirmation of what happened to 
    her. </p>
  <p>By combination of internal terror and narrow nationalist ideology the LTTE 
    succeeded in atomizing the community. It took away not only the right to oppose 
    but even the right to evaluate, as a community, the course they were taking. 
    This gives a semblance of illusion that the whole society is behind the LTTE. 
    Since the UTHR(J) was part of the initiative in trying to open up space in 
    the University, many sharing its aims associated with it openly in the early 
    days. This was until Rajani Thiranagama was killed. Abandoning and winding 
    up the UTHR(J) now would mean capitulating of the oppressor. We therefore 
    felt that it is essential to continue with the reports under the same name, 
    although we had been forced to leave the University of Jaffna [See Report 
    11, <a href="Reports/Report11/appendix5.htm">Appendix</a>].</p>
  <p>Accusations that no one in the University of Jaffna is at present associated 
    with the UTHR(J), only highlights the stark reality of a terrorized political 
    environment. Its says volumes about the internal terror which paralysed the 
    community rather than diminishing the legitimacy of the UTHR(J). After years 
    of terror and paralysis in the mis-1980s, the University re-established its 
    role during the short period following the Indo-Lanka Accord and functioned 
    as a vibrant institution with the students and staff regaining their dignity. 
    The killing of Rajani Thiranagama was the first step in pushing the University 
    back to the dark days of 1985-86. Acquiescing in that terror and disbanding 
    the UTHR(J) would have nullified the sacrifices made by many. We continue 
    to use the name as guardians of the legacy and values born through the sacrifice 
    of several others directly and indirectly associated with us.</p>
