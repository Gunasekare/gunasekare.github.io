style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A SECOND PREFACE</span></b></font></p>
<p class=Headera align=center style='text-align:center;
'><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>February, 1990</span></b></font></p>
<p class=Headera style='text-align:justify;'><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";letter-spacing:-.1pt'>A second 
  preface was thought necessary because two years have elapsed since the original 
  manuscript was ready, and many things have taken place in the intervening months, 
  including the murder of Dr.Rajani Thiranagama, one of the co-authors. The authors 
  have also had time to reflect on what they wrote nearly two years ago during 
  the heat of the October 1987 war and its immediate aftermath. While preserving 
  the emotional impact of these events, some editing has been done on the material 
  in the pre-publication issue in the interests of greater fairness and objectivity. 
  We have also removed impressions which affected us then, but would now obscure 
  the book's wider significance. Also included is a postscript written by the 
  late Dr. Rajani Thiranagama. Although we privately circulated the pre-publication 
  issue, we delayed mass distribution because of a few revisions we wanted to 
  make. But unfortunately, certain happenings led to the widespread distribution 
  of the copies of the pre-publication issue. To further compound matters, Rajani 
  was killed in September last year. Therefore we decided to publish the book 
  with few changes.</span></font></p>
<p class=Headera style='text-align:justify;'><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span> 
  </span>As we have mentioned earlier, countless young men had voluntarily taken 
  up arms and laid down their lives for a cause on behalf of the entire Tamil 
  population, in a war that was being waged against the chauvinist Sri Lankan 
  state. Sometimes they fought in the hope of obtaining their goal of Eelam - 
  a separate state - only in the distant future. The writing of an analysis of 
  the whole period of struggle, of its willing and unwilling participants, and 
  its history, which questions many an assumption and theory, may seem, to many, 
  irresponsible and foolish. Others may say, to indulge in self-criticism in the 
  hey-day of nationalist fervour was adventuristic and suicidal.</font></p>
<p class=Headera style='text-align:justify;'><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span> 
  </span>Apart from other considerations,we felt that we owed the writing of 
  this book to our young men in their teens who are on the streets carrying some 
  of the most sophisticated weapons in the world. We also owe it to our young 
  men and women to whom we hand down nothing but hypocrisy, despondency and hopelessness.The 
  present drift was destroying the creative capacity of a whole generation of 
  youths, exploiting their aspirations and transforming them into enemies fighting 
  one another.</font></p>
<p class=Headera style='text-align:justify;'><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span></span> 
  We also felt the need for the articulation of independent but authentic sentiments 
  of the people. The people generally reacted instinctively to contingencies, 
  without going beyond what is apparent. Nor did they have the will to look at 
  them critically. It was hoped that a space for independent, objective, thinking, 
  keeping the people as its focal point, would evolve.</font></p>
<p class=Headera style='text-align:justify;'><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span> 
  </span>In the process of writing this book, we have over and over again come 
  to the conclusion that any positive development of our history rests primarily 
  on ourselves. Therefore, while condemning in no uncertain terms all open and 
  covert subversion of the politics of the liberation period by external forces 
  such as the Indian State, and the short-sightedness of its present and erstwhile 
  local allies who had lost sight of original goals, we have stressed the need 
  to study our aspirations, assumptions and susceptibilities. This may well be 
  too great a challenge to those whose exclusive idealism is not sympathetic to 
  criticism. The liberation struggle has always opted for militaristic solutions. 
  Critics and adversaries were killed. Dissidents were killed and branded traitors. 
  Criticism is often termed &quot;an attempt to sully the sublimity of the movement&quot;. 
  Politics becomes the prerogative of the militarily strongest group. And even 
  its capitulations to the pressures of discredited forces are interpreted as 
  a furthering of the cause of Eelam.</font></p>
<p class=Headera style='text-align:justify;'><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span> 
  </span>Thus in this strait-jacketed ethos of ours, there was a strong need to 
  tap the seething but dormant consciousness of the people. It is appropriate 
  at this moment to quote an excerpt from Rajani Thiranagama's writings:</font></p>
<p class=Headera style='text-align:justify;'><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";letter-spacing:-.1pt'>&quot;A 
  state of resignation envelopes the community. The long shadow of the gun has 
  not only been the source of power and glory, but also of fear and terror as 
  well. In the menacing shadow play, forces complementing each other, dance in 
  each other's momentum. The paralysing depression is not due to the violence 
  and authority imposed from outside, but rather to the destructive violence emanating 
  from within the womb of our society.&quot;</span></font></p>
<p class=Headera style='text-align:justify;'><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span> 
  </span>Why was Rajani Thiranagama murdered ? It is a question not answered by 
  her killers who have chosen anonymity. When there were moves to commemorate 
  her life and work, questions were raised by many Tamils from around the world: 
  &quot;Why should she alone be remembered and commemorated amidst so many killed 
  and unremembered?&quot;</font></p>
<p class=Headera style='text-align:justify;'><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span> 
  </span>She was killed because her sense of responsibility demanded that, in 
  her concern for the meaningless deaths of ordinary people, the dominant political 
  trends of this society ought to be questioned. The accepted practice was to 
  use the statistics of the dead to castigate the villain of the moment from the 
  capitals of the world. It accorded well with the thrust of using people as cannon 
  fodder for the purposes of propaganda. Rajani did what was unacceptable. She 
  asked questions that went deep into the causes of destruction and questioned 
  the politics behind it. She viewed the writing of &quot;The Broken Palmyrah,&quot; 
  not as an isolated scholarly socio-historical analysis, but as a democratic 
  treatment of the people. She was never indifferent to the fate of those who 
  had taken up arms for a cause they knew little about. She was often sympathetic 
  to their stated aspirations and tried to begin a dialogue with them, although 
  she did not share their views.</font></p>
<p class=Headera style='text-align:justify;'><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span> 
  </span>Right from her undergraduate days, Rajani had yearned and fought for 
  social justice and equality. Whether it be student issues, the discrimination 
  against Tamils, the National Question or general strikes, she always aligned 
  herself with the oppressed parties. She stood up in very delicate situations 
  and argued, confronted and negotiated for the rights of the people. During her 
  stay in Britain from 1983 to 1986, she, together with her postgraduate studies, 
  participated in the various political and socio-cultural struggles of the black 
  people. She shared in the striving of blacks for an end to discrimination and 
  their recognition as a political force to be esteemed. She did this with her 
  characteristic enthusiasm. It was particularly in the sphere of black women 
  and feminism that she explored specific issues and concepts concerning women, 
  within the broader framework of class, black struggles and other third world 
  phenomena.</font></p>
<p class=Headera style='text-align:justify;'><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span> 
  </span>Rajani's involvement with women's groups and issues was part of her broader 
  concern for people, especially oppressed people. She found in women's struggles 
  for survival with dignity and independence, a message for all struggling people. 
  When a group of women in Jaffna came together to establish a home for women 
  in need-&quot;The Poorani Women's Centre&quot; - she gave generously of herself 
  to the task of establishing it and seeing it through its teething problems. 
  Her theoretical undertakings in feminism and her personal relationships with 
  women inside and outside the university are instances of how she yoked theory 
  and practice together.</font></p>
<p class=Headera style='text-align:justify;'><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span> 
  </span>A peace march to express the people's feelings about the militarisation 
  of the young had been one of Rajani's last wishes. She had also suggested the 
  slogan &quot;We want bread; not bullets&quot;. This was taken up by those who 
  had been inspired by her and such a march, quite independent of any political 
  group, was held on 21 November, 1989. It was joined-in by representatives from 
  the Sinhalese South, Britain, India, Pakistan, Netherlands, South Africa and 
  Tanzania. Tributes were received from persons great and small from around the 
  world. </font></p>
<p class=Headera style='text-align:justify;'><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span> 
  </span>When a medical student spoke at the meeting held after the peace march 
  to commemorate Rajani, he recalled Rajani in connection with this particular 
  issue of militarisation. Shortly before her death, after her return from England, 
  she had called him up and had asked him gravely, what they were doing about 
  it as a student body. This was during the height of the I.P.K.F. sponsored forced 
  conscription. He further said at the commemoration meeting: </font></p>
<p class=Headera style='text-align:justify;'><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";letter-spacing:-.1pt'>&quot;During 
  the peace march which preceded this meeting, I was struck by what two conscripts 
  from the T.N.A. said as we passed them. They said, 'Had you marched a few months 
  earlier,we would not be here in these uniforms, holding these guns'. On the 
  other hand, in Vadamaratchi where I come from, boys around 13 and 14 years old 
  are induced to carry weapons without any political understanding. Disillusionment 
  sets in fast. All that remains is a thirst for vengeance&quot;.</span></font></p>
<p class=Headera style='text-align:justify;'><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";letter-spacing:-.1pt'>These 
  student leaders knew the risks. They understood the nuances when gunmen came 
  and spoke to them. They knew that business was meant. When they walk the streets 
  after dark or go to their rooms for the night, they are exposed and helpless. 
  The death that threatens them is not instant death in the rush of battle, but 
  death as an ever present possibility. They knew why their friend and mentor, 
  Rajani, was killed. They were keenly aware of the fate of Vimaleswaran, a former 
  student leader</span></font></p>
<p class=Headera style='text-align:justify;'><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span> 
  </span>The courage and an unyielding analytical and emotional thrust that Rajani 
  had inspired in this particular student is the kind of influence she had on 
  many around her. Her actions, writings and her passionate concern, stand in 
  stark contrast to those who hold positions in this society without acknowledging 
  the associated responsibility. It is because of the explosive potential of her 
  memory that many are trying to either play it down or suppress it. It also explains 
  why many were uncomfortable with her - some even to the point of wanting her 
  killed. </font></p>
<p class=Headera style='text-align:justify;'><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span> 
  </span>A chronic fear of violent bodily harm is an ever present feature of Tamil 
  life. Many Tamils fled this country in fear following the anti-Tamil violence 
  of July 1983 and its aftermath. Now they live in London, New York, Toronto, 
  Oslo, Amsterdam and so on. And the fear remains and is more subtle, but it still 
  is very real. This time it comes from within. Speakers billed to speak at meetings 
  suddenly tender excuses. Someone participating in a cultural show receives a 
  call because it is sponsored by persons independent of a powerful group. Those 
  not happy with the main propaganda line talk in hushed tones at public gatherings. 
  Messages are passed on half jokingly that someone whose views were unpalatable, 
  would be kidnapped. Persons organising something like a scheme to help ex-militants 
  abroad, receive a call from Colombo or Madras threatening with death their close 
  relatives back at home. This plague of fear becomes obscene only by being tolerated.</font></p>
<p class=Headera style='text-align:justify;'><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span> 
  </span>The Tamils have become isolated individuals without a sense of community. 
  Even in conditions where they can appeal for help from the forces of law and 
  order, and where the press could be sympathetic, they find themselves unable 
  to organise in the interests of their self-respect and dignity. With a few exceptions, 
  the Tamil-Associations that dot the world are gatherings where they can conveniently 
  and uncritically misrepresent events at home. They are inextricably linked to 
  the sickness and its cure back at home. </font></p>
<p class=Headera style='text-align:justify;'><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span> 
  </span>This brings us to hundreds of young men who had once meant well and later 
  left their militant groups, often broken and disillusioned, to live out their 
  existence in India and the capitals of the West, as men in a hangover. Many 
  of them helped to recruit large numbers to their organisation. Others have been 
  well known killers. Some number their murdered victims in the tens. If these 
  persons have any sense of responsibility or any courage left, continued silence 
  is not the honourable option open to them. For the good of those of their community 
  who can still be saved, they must risk coming out openly and confessing that 
  they were wrong and that what they had advocated is wrong. Rajani had once helped 
  a militant group. It is a measure of her sense of responsibility that she came 
  out and openly repudiated what the group had stood for. In this she was almost 
  an exception. That was why she felt inclined to carry on her shoulders in tears, 
  the responsibility of the community for having brought our young to this.</font></p>
<p class=Headera style='text-align:justify;'><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span> 
  </span>With the passage of time, and after what happened to Rajani - a supreme 
  act of intolerance- we have felt a greater need to publish this as a collective 
  work. Any reader is bound to come across within these pages, a divergence of 
  views. Much of this will turn out to be complementary. We wish to demonstrate 
  that despite our differences, we are willing to work together, listen to reasoned 
  argument, and remain open to being changed by each other. This is not only the 
  ideal of science, but also of the search for truth. We would also defend each 
  other's right to hold his or her different opinions.</font></p>
<p class=Headera style='text-align:justify;'><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span> 
  </span>We wish to thank many friends and acquaintances who have been sympathetic 
  to the publication of this book and have helped us by making many suggestions 
  in the interests of fairness, have pointed out errors of fact, and have given 
  much valuable time to going through the contents, paying attention to detail. 
  Finally we thank all those who helped us in the several aspects of publication 
  and distribution.</font></p>
