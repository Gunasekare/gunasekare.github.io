<p style='text-align:justify;'><b>6.1       Introduction<u></u></b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>The tragedies of the October war continued relentlessly 
  into November and December. It left us among the dead, the debris and the crumbling 
  structures. The smell of putrefaction clung to the fresh morning air. The terror 
  of the army on every street corner, molestation and even rape became facts of 
  life. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>It left us paralysed - benumbed as a community in a political 
  and structural vacuum. It also left us with this terrible knowledge that people 
  are but dispensable numbers: rape and molestation inevitable facts for the warring 
  parties. It left us bitter, and angry that these gruesome consequences were 
  even awaited with certain satisfaction as good material for international propaganda 
  by the &quot;leaders&quot;of the people. The sadism of this situation seemed 
  the greatest blow to the community. We sat by, watching the Indian military 
  presence become well entrenched in our land, sea and sky, and Indian political 
  dominance a creeping reality.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>Unlike other analyses that have come up, we do not see 
  the current crisis as resulting from distinct events that stand on their own 
  and, therefore, one that is subject to being analysed episodically. As such 
  we do not consider this war as a catastrophic consequence of a simple misjudgment 
  on the part of the Tigers or India. Nor do we consider it as a consequence of 
  the inbuilt fears that the Tigers are presumed to have of democracy and elections. 
  Contrary to the popular view, we do not think that if the single event of handing 
  over the 17 L.T.T.E. men had not occurred, every thing would have been fair 
  and fine for the peace accord, the L.T.T.E., the Tamils and the I.P.K.F.. Though 
  all these views have elements of truth in them, we agree with those who place 
  the war in a geopolitical context. However we do not agree that the correct 
  and methodical interaction of foreign policy institutions or the clever manoeuvring 
  of foreign policy can simply determine this geopolitical reality in our favour. 
  </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>All these opinions view history as a chain of events. 
  Rather, history is an evolutionary process where events are manifestations. 
  We see this war as a historical legacy of the way social forces within the Tamil 
  and Sinhalese nations developed and interacted. An analysis of the political 
  background of the war and Indo-Sri Lankan relations, would entail analysing 
  not only the geopolitical situation, but also the internal contradictions of 
  the Tamil and Sinhalese communities. Such a treatment is very important for 
  us, because many Tamil intellectuals of nationalist leanings see the contradictions, 
  objectives and interactions within the Tamil nation in a simplified framework 
  in isolation of southern Sri Lanka. This cloistered view had been one of the 
  deterrents to constructing a viable nationalist objective. </span></p>

style='font-size:10.0pt'>In this sketch an encompassing view is attempted, within 
  the framework of historical analysis. However, this does not come in the best 
  forms of polemical discourse enthralling left intellectuals and Marxist theorists, 
  but rather breaks into emotional and descriptive scenarios. This has been inevitable 
  for us, as we are participants in the pain and agony of a nation. This sketch 
  is attempted principally to bring out into the open the little known side of 
  our nation (already people are adapting themselves to living with reality, pushing 
  and smothering the pain into the recesses of memory) and the underlying causative 
  processes and forces. However, this study is incomplete as no particular force 
  is dealt with in detail and the sketch draws in broad strokes certain outlines 
  of the tendencies.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;'><b>Present Crisis</b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><b>6.2.1       Mother India: Illusion or Reality</b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>Many in the Tamil community expressed shocked disbelief 
  in the way the October war was conducted. The ruling classes of the Tamil nation 
  had always seen India as a patron, an arbitrator, and an advocate of Tamil aspirations. 
  This perception was not only based on the cultural and emotional links with 
  southern India, but also on a studied intellectual approach. Ideas such as exploiting 
  India's great power pretensions as a useful tool for advancing the Tamil separatist 
  cause, have been put forward by Tamil intellectuals. But is this a correct perception? 
  What is India's thrust abroad?</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><b>6.2.2       India's thrust abroad</b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'>It is argued that in the context of power relations 
  in South Asia, India has some autonomy and its foreign policies may sometimes 
  even conflict with imperial centres - although it still remains basically dependent. 
  It has been proposed that the development of Indian capitalism pushes it to 
  look abroad for markets and resources. This is further enhanced by the perception 
  of India as a potentially great power. These analyses trace this great power 
  perception to the colonial period when emerging Indian elites acted as imperial 
  agents for Britain.         Another reason given for India's thrust abroad is 
  the pre-capitalist social formation in India, and the inability of the local 
  market to respond to the needs of India's growing industrial power and further 
  capital accumulation. This can be seen as part of India's diplomatic thrust 
  in the neighbourhood. In this, those interests of India, that can supply goods 
  at very competitive prices, would run counter to those of the western countries 
  and Japan.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>Therefore despite the fact that India is in size and 
  scale a big nation in the region, its influence abroad is impeded by internal 
  contradictions. Moreover its influence is uneven in the region. For example, 
  take the case of Sri Lanka, the southern neighbour, and in the north of the 
  region, Nepal and Bhutan. Nepal and Bhutan are more or less totally integrated 
  into India economically, and due to their strategic importance (along the northern 
  border), politically and militarily as well. But Sri Lanka had been able to 
  circumvent such integration and control. To understand the reasons for the relative 
  autonomy of Sri Lanka, we have to search the historical roots of Indo-Sri Lankan 
  relations since the colonial time. </span></p>
<span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";"Times New Roman";'><br clear=all style='page-break-before:auto;

<p style='text-align:justify;'><b>6.2.3       The Colonial past and the evolution 
  of </b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><b><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>Sri Lanka's Economy</span></b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>During British rule some sections of the Indian elite 
  assisted in the administration of colonial structures and the imperial capitalist 
  system, not only in India, but all over the British Raj. In the imperial interests 
  Sri Lanka was designated a crown colony and received preferential treatment 
  in the region because of its smallness in size.This rendered it amenable to 
  control. India's ruling class, because of its relative internal strength and 
  independence, was always more of a threat to the colonial administration than 
  the Sri Lankan ruling class. Furthermore, Sri Lanka's geographical position 
  in the Indian ocean and the possession of a natural harbour at Trincomalee, 
  made this accommodation and preferential treatment useful for continued control 
  of the important sea-lanes of the Indian Ocean. Apart from the colonial designs 
  to subjugate the whole region, internally there was overwhelming consensus on 
  stubbornly maintaining Sri Lanka's relative autonomy from India. For instance, 
  the East India Company administration was forced to withdraw the Indian civil 
  administrators in its service, after agitation by the indigenous population. 
  This shows a contrasting experience to that of countries like Nepal and Bhutan 
  where Indian civil administrators and migrant traders were an instrument in 
  controlling the indigenous people. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>There is another side to this story of opposition to 
  Indian influence however. In the mid-nineteenth century the colonial administration 
  brought in large numbers of impoverished Indian Tamil peasantry from South India 
  to work the plantations in Sri Lanka, when the local Sinhalese had refused to 
  be incorporated into the plantation sector. These Indian Tamil labourers were 
  brought in as indentured labour in conditions of near slavery. The Indian Tamil 
  labour who built up the plantation sector and who, even to this day, remain 
  the backbone of the country's economy, were simply grafted on to Sri Lankan 
  society by their colonial masters and were rejected as aliens by the local population. 
  In post-independence Sri Lanka their situation deteriorated. They were disenfranchised 
  and became the most exploited and oppressed social group within the country. 
  Unfortunately the growing contradiction between the local subsistence agriculture 
  and the plantation sector manifested itself in the most fierce antagonism towards 
  this under privileged group. Unscrupulous political elements used this contradiction 
  to their advantage by portraying this dispossessed poverty stricken group as 
  an arm of Indian expansionism. Even opposition to Indian supremacy in the region 
  was expressed by victimising this minority group. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>The local ruling classes, both indigenous Tamil and Sinhalese 
  however, had an upward mobility during colonial rule. The Tamils especially 
  in the lower rungs of the civil service; The Sinhalese in trading, small scale 
  plantations, and satellite services to the plantation sector as well as in the 
  civil services. In fact though there were prosperous Indian and Moor traders 
  in Sri Lanka, they were viewed with intense antagonism by the Sinhalese trading 
  class. The real content of this anti-Indianism was that the local ruling classes 
  did not want another group that was exercising control. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><b>6.2.4       Post Colonial Sri Lanka: Rise of 
  </b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><b><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>Narrow Nationalism</span></b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>Unlike in many other small states in the region, Colonial 
  Sri Lanka occupied a defined place in British imperial designs in the South 
  Asian region, and the Sri Lankan ruling class had a competitive relationship 
  with Indian counterparts who came into the island. Furthermore, the historical 
  development of nationalist movements in Sri Lanka, showed that, though their 
  anti-colonial ideologies were complementary to and derived inspiration from 
  the Indian nationalist movements, they had also an underlying contradiction 
  with them. This contradiction arose from the content of nationalism itself, 
  which was based on the economy of the ruling classes of Sri Lanka. Colonial 
  penetration had made the Sri Lankan economy totally integrated and fully absorbed 
  into the imperial economic system. Plantations became the main economic activity 
  of this island. The rising middle classes of the Sinhalese and the Tamil communities 
  were integrated into servicing the colonial economy and administration. Therefore, 
  though anti-colonial struggles were waged, and nationalism was espoused by the 
  middle classes, the thrust was limited. The middle class had no strong economic 
  base to rely on, except the colonial economy; nor did it have indigenous economic 
  roots to compete with the colonial power. Thus the anti-colonialism of this 
  class and its anger against domination were only emotional. Its link with the 
  nation and the people took the form of cultural and religious identity. Its 
  alienation made it necessary for its assertion as part of the broad sweep of 
  the people. This assertion was articulated in terms of overwhelming enthusiasm 
  for the emotional content of culture and past history. Its real economic contradictions, 
  for example on the Sinhalese side, lay in its competition with the Tamil middle 
  class and Indian trading class for colonial spill-overs. Therefore the contradictions 
  between the rising Sinhalese middle class on the one hand and the Tamil middle 
  class and Indian trading class on the other, made Sinhalese nationalism contain 
  seeds of anti-Tamil, anti-Indian sentiments. Excellent studies on this subject 
  have been done by Kumari Jayawardana.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>In post-colonial Sri Lanka, under the system of parliamentary 
  democracy, this class aimed at domination of its competitors from the Tamil 
  community for the economic and political control of the newly independent state. 
  Sinhalese chauvinism played on the cultural connection between the Tamils of 
  Sri Lanka and the Tamils of South India and created fears of Tamils conniving 
  with India to submerge the Sinhalese nation and destroy its language and religion. 
  The Sinhalese chauvinists mythified their role in preserving the Buddhist religion, 
  the Sinhalese race, and the language, and with this ideology they were able 
  to appeal to a broad base, across class, caste and region. Thus it became the 
  most useful ideology for a ruling class, who sought power through parliament. 
  On the other hand, Tamil nationalism, though of similar class base and aspiration, 
  could not attain to power in the independent state. Thus incipient anti-Sinhalese 
  sentiments could never take the offensive in a concrete form. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>Therefore, to sum up, for the ruling classes of both 
  communities consolidation of power depended on the espousal of these narrow 
  nationalist ideologies, and because, since independence &quot;state power&quot; 
  rested in the hands of the Sinhalese ruling class, Sinhalese Buddhist chauvinism 
  became institutionalised, over a period of time. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><b>6.2.5       Sinhalese Chauvinism and Tamil Nationalism</b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>This presentation does not provide the scope to digress 
  into a detailed account of the history of Tamil nationalism. We instead concentrate 
  on certain aspects which throw light on the nature of the forces leading to 
  the particular history of the Tamils. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>There was a basic difference in the material base of 
  the ruling classes of the two communities. The plantation sector, the mainstay 
  of the colonial economy, was physically placed in the South and it opened up 
  many avenues for the Sinhalese ruling class to enter into the colonial capitalist 
  system. There was no economic activity of comparable dimension introduced in 
  the Tamil areas by the colonial rulers, that could stimulate indigenous economic 
  enterprises and create wealth. Therefore the rising Tamil middle classes found 
  economic prosperity by servicing the colonial administration in the South and 
  elsewhere. The Tamil middle class sought to prosper by the assiduous pursuance 
  of British education; and thus serviced the lower rungs of the colonial bureaucracy. 
  They produced professionals and personnel to service other civil institutions, 
  such as the schools. They were a class created by British colonialism. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>This colonial legacy ensured their position as an intermediary 
  controlling group even in majority Sinhalese areas of the South. This privileged 
  position produced an overblown psychology of superiority. However the underpinning 
  material base consisted of economic activity totally under the control of the 
  state structure, and dependent on the South. This weak and paradoxical position 
  was to produce both the impetus as well as the impediments to the growth of 
  Tamil nationalism. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>After independence the state gradually pursued overtly 
  discriminatory policies against the Tamils. As Sinhalese Buddhist chauvinism 
  became institutionalised, the pervasive influence of this ideology touched every 
  aspect of Tamil life-employment, land, education, and industrial development. 
  The discriminatory policies eroded the mainstay of the Tamil middle class's 
  economic base. This increasing threat to their livelihood in the state structure 
  and in the South, and the feeling that they were being pushed around and treated 
  as second class citizens, frustrated and angered the middle class Tamils. However, 
  being economically dependent, they could not be free. Thus they continued to 
  be accommodating, while suppressing their bitterness and anger. The political 
  parties of this class harnessed this anger to consolidate their power. They 
  also reflected this paradox of conflict between their emotions and the economy. 
  Their rhetoric was fiery and appealing to the consciousness of the Tamils, who 
  considered themselves intellectually superior to the Sinhalese. But the political 
  practice was one of bargaining with the Sinhalese leadership for parliamentary 
  power sharing- reflecting their dependency in fundamental areas.. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'>However the most important aspects of national 
  oppression, such as the question of the state aided land colonisation of Tamil 
  lands by Sinhalese, and the encroachment into Tamil fishing areas by marauding 
  Sinhalese fishermen with state patronage, were hardly identified as the primary 
  issues by the nationalist leadership of the T.U.L.F.. These issues were simply 
  exploited to raise rhetorical cries in parliament about national oppression. 
  In fact there was no attempt to mobilise and take forward those poorer sections 
  of the Tamil community whose very existence was threatened by these activities 
  of the state. Thus they ignored the erosion of the material base of the broad 
  masses of the Tamil people and concentrated on a few problems of the Tamil ruling 
  class. The Sinhalese leadership was fully immersed in its chauvinistic ideology, 
  which was intolerant of any real power sharing with the Tamils. Invariably, 
  up to the 1970s, the Sinhalese parties had to rely on some participation of 
  Tamil nationalists in forming    governments and this created an illusion among 
  the Tamils regarding power sharing. In 1970 the S.L.F.P. came to power with 
  an absolute majority and thus exposed the Tamil leadership's parliamentary political 
  limitations in parliamentary politics. Discrimination and oppression worsened 
  over the 1970s Passive protests by Tamil nationalists were quelled violently 
  with the use of state power, and worse still, from 1977 onwards, anti-Tamil 
  mob-violence (euphemistically called &quot;race riots&quot;) was periodically 
  let loose, at increasing frequency.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>The failure of the Tamil national leadership to get anything 
  from the Sinhalese ruling class through parliament was in contradiction with 
  the rhetoric of anger and the slogans of valour they were feeding the electorate. 
  As a consequence of this a sense of frustration and bitterness was created among 
  the people. And as brutal mob violence was the reply to non-violence, Tamil 
  nationalism no longer confined itself to a class but reached out to all sectors 
  of the people across class, caste, and regional barriers. Sinhalese chauvinist 
  oppression became the objective common denominator. Anger and frustration at 
  this ignominy and threat to life brought a binding emotion and a feeling of 
  togetherness in the community. The youth who were most affected by the discriminatory 
  policies (such as media wise standardisation in higher education and the quota 
  system in employment) demanded a more autonomous life and voiced the anger of 
  the people..</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>The youth and the more radical elements felt that the 
  parting of the ways had come and that coexistence with the Sinhalese was no 
  longer possible. Thus the Tamil bourgeois leadership had to adopt the slogan 
  of &quot;Tamil Eelam” - the cry for a separate state-for their political existence. 
  But they had no concrete programme towards this objective. Of course the Tamil 
  nationalist leadership could not pull the Eelam rabbit out of the parliamentary 
  hat. The leadership had put forward a cry that they knew could never be fulfilled 
  in a constitutional way, and Eelam had never been practicable with their class's 
  economical integration and dependency on the South. Moreover they failed to 
  discuss these realities with the people and give them a more viable alternative. 
  They kept the people under an illusion, by such slogans calling the T.U.L.F. 
  leader Chelvanayagam the Mujibur of Eelam, and even hinted at taking up arms 
  from the election platforms. Critics of these slogans were called traitors to 
  the &quot;cause&quot;. However little progress was made inside or outside parliament 
  apart from the T.U.L.F. leadership's praising the President as the greatest 
  democrat in South Asia.At the same time the Tamil people faced the 1977 race 
  riots and they had to run away, again hunted. The T.U.L.F. was impotent. As 
  a result the sense of betrayal was acute amongst the youth and the people. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>The Tamil national struggle became increasingly isolated 
  and separatist through the intransigence of the Sinhalese nationalists, in whom 
  the power of the state resided. But it would be wrong to view Tamil nationalism, 
  even though the cry of secession was raised after three decades of increasing 
  oppression, as defensive in every aspect; or that it became narrow nationalist 
  and aggressive only after the ascendence of the militancy.(Tamil nationalists 
  like their counterparts, had a sense of superiority. Their historical build 
  up from the feudal past was equally mythical and romantic. They were feeding 
  their electorates and the youth with images of valour, preservation of race 
  and language, and a history heavily loaded with anti-Sinhalese, pro-Indian ingredients. 
  </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>Tamil politicians often drew images from history harking 
  back to the &quot;glorious&quot; days of the Tamil kings and the days of the 
  Chola empire in South India. They contrasted the antiquity and purity of the 
  Tamil language with the more recent development of the Sinhalese language, scoffing 
  at the latter as a derivative of other Indian languages. They attributed the 
  high levels of literacy and education amongst Tamils to their superior intelligence 
  as opposed to the Sinhalese whom, they claimed, were lazy and less intellectually 
  inclined. The anger that the old guard Tamil leadership felt against Sinhalese 
  domination was due to their perception of themselves as rulers in the past now 
  enslaved by an &quot;alien&quot; people. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>Though nationalism was meaningful due to the threat to 
  existence under the Sri Lankan state, its narrowness, violent rhetoric and bigoted 
  imagery were the reactionary elements that were to remain with the nation. The 
  militants were not the initiators; they were the continuation of this history. 
  The ideology in its totality, goes to the credit of the &quot;moderate&quot; 
  and &quot;middle of the road&quot; nationalists, who were the initiators of 
  this narrowness. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>The extreme narrowness of their ideology prevented them 
  from organising at grass roots level around the real issues of national oppression. 
  They whipped up nationalist fervour from election platforms, repeatedly evoking 
  these reactionary images and sentiments. The people were not politically conscientious 
  or prepared for the kind of events to come. Their political consciousness was 
  simply taken up to a secessionist stage, just for the political existence of 
  a party and its need to get into parliament, </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>Another serious defect of Tamil nationalism was its regional 
  bias. The nationalist leadership even within the ruling class was confined to 
  the educated middle class which was mainly from the Jaffna peninsula. This group, 
  most affected by state discrimination in education and employment, unfortunately 
  became the leading force in the struggle.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>The Eastern Province, despite its extreme underdevelopment 
  in comparison to Jaffna and the South, remained a rich agricultural area, self 
  sufficient in major crops such as rice. Some sections of the ruling class in 
  the Eastern Province had their base in large land holdings and were not as dependent 
  on the South or on state patronage as the Jaffna Tamils. Therefore they responded 
  to the state's oppressive measures rather differently from the peninsula Tamils. 
  Historically, the two regions developed in different directions with regard 
  to economic and social organisation and cultural practice. Further, the Jaffna 
  Tamils acted on behalf of the state as civil administrators and officials in 
  the Eastern Province and established their dominance. As a result the Batticaloa 
  Tamils learned to regard the peninsula Tamils and their motives with deep suspicion. 
  All these factors contributed to Tamil nationalism taking on primarily a Jaffna 
  face. And when Sinhalese chauvinism revealed its most sinister motives through 
  its policies such as the disenfranchisement of Tamil plantation workers and 
  the colonisation of Tamil lands with Sinhalese settlers, the Tamil leadership 
  offered no tangible way forward.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>After independence the successive Sinhalese governments 
  created a policy of land alienation in areas of Tamil concentration to Sinhalese 
  settlers. Bands of settlers were brought into these Tamil villages with state 
  patronage. Over the years this changed the whole demography of some areas in 
  the Eastern Province such as the Ampara District, the strategically important 
  town of Trincomalee and the villages surrounding it. Tamils who were the majority 
  in all these areas have now become minorities. It has even tilted the electoral 
  balance further in favour of the Sinhalese. The hill country Tamils lived concentrated 
  on tea estates, surrounded by Sinhalese villages. Geographically, they were 
  separated from the native Sri Lankan Tamils who lived in the North and the East. 
  All along the indigenous Tamils shunned them socially, mainly because of their 
  lower class and caste backgrounds. The first Sinhalese government disenfranchised 
  the Indian Tamils. Some sections of the upperclass Sri Lankan Tamils also viewed 
  the Indian Tamils as a potential threat in the future and supported the move. 
  The more moderate or liberal Tamil politicians were at best indifferent to the 
  plight of the plantation labour. Their issues were taken on often to bolster 
  their propaganda war. This trend continued even when the militant movements 
  took over the nationalist mantle. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><b>6.2.6       Sinhalese Chauvinism and Indo-Sri 
  Lanka</b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><b><span> </span>               Relations: Control 
  or Coexistence ?</b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>As we saw earlier, Sinhalese chauvinism was essentially 
  anti- Indian. Such factors made Sri Lanka keep itself at the peripheries of 
  the Indian ambit, and pushed the Sinhalese ruling class to further ties with 
  countries outside the Indian orbit, particularly with the industrialized West 
  and China. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>However, these ties were never developed to the levels 
  of being antagonistic to India. All Sri Lankan ruling parties, before 1977, 
  co-existed with a tactical understanding of Indian aspirations. In hindsight 
  it can be seen that India also did not push its influence on its smaller southern 
  neighbour. For India to play a more aggressive role there would have to have 
  been one of two causes: either a danger to its strategic defence or the needs 
  of its expanding economy. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>Also a more aggressive Indian role seems to have been 
  curtailed by its own perceptions. The plight of the Indian Tamil plantation 
  workers in Sri Lanka who were viewed as India's fifth column by the Sinhalese, 
  is a case in point. When the Sinhalese racist parties wished to repatriate the 
  Indian plantation workers back to India, the Indian Government signed the Sirima-Shastri 
  Pact without any reservation. The Sirima-Shastri Pact repatriated more than 
  500,000 plantation workers, many against their will, breaking up communities 
  and even families in the process. The Sinhalese perception that India will use 
  these workers to gain a foothold in Sri Lanka is mistaken, because the Indian 
  state is conditioned by the fact that they are mere workers and not possible 
  rulers.</span></p>

style='font-size:10.0pt'>Sinhalese supremacy was the basis on which especially 
  S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike's S.L.F.P. came to power in 1956. But economically it 
  proposed a state capitalist structure and a welfarist and reformist policy. 
  Though the programme itself contained some egalitarian principles, because of 
  the Sinhalese chauvinistic bias, the Tamil population was politically and economically 
  affected. The Bandaranaike-Chelvanayagam pact - one of the most generous and 
  rational packages to be offered by chauvinist governments - had to be abandoned 
  due to protest from the U.N.P. with the connivance of the Buddhist clergy. The 
  course was set for deteriorating communal relations.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>The economy continued in the same pattern with various 
  modifications - but Sinhalese chauvinism still remained the dominant ideology, 
  continuing its oppression of the Tamils. A break in the economic system, and 
  change in political thinking came in 1977 when the U.N.P., with J.R. Jayewardene 
  at the helm, swept into power mainly on an economic programme of free market 
  policies. It was put forward as a panacea for the evils of the welfare capitalism 
  of Mrs.Bandaranaike with its stagnation, queues, unemployment etc. Though the 
  U.N.P. manifesto adopted a more conciliatory tone on the national question to 
  go with its capitalist open economy programme, its political existence seemed 
  again to rest on a base whose dominant ideology was Sinhalese-Buddhist chauvinism. 
  At the time of the elections the overriding economic concerns seemed to obscure 
  the ideological underpinnings,but the dormant chauvinism showed up with the 
  eruption of the 1977 race riots. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>The alienation of Tamil nationalists, increasing discrimination, 
  and violent oppression of the Tamil community, had created the conditions for 
  the phase of armed struggle to be born. J.R., a die-hard, pro-American politician, 
  developed pro-Western economic programmes and alliances, and, in his attempt 
  to smash the Tamil resistance, sought the help of Western allies. The United 
  States' good offices brought in Israel as a military advisor, and a V.O.A. base 
  was established in Chilaw, disseminating American propaganda. Trincomalee harbour 
  was made available, ostensibly for refuelling facilities for American ships, 
  and more ambitious plans were rumoured. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>These moves were perceived by India as openly subverting 
  its interests. The U. S. and the West saw in the Sri Lankan state a staunch 
  ally and an important check to India's growth as a regional power, especially 
  after India's ties with the Soviet Union were strengthened. The strategic importance 
  of Trincomalee, the natural harbour, underscored the superpowers' interests. 
  </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><b>6.2.8       1983 - A Turning Point</b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>1983 was the watershed for local and regional forces 
  - for the Sinhalese chauvinist state, the Tamil militants, for Indian interests; 
  revolutionary politics and militarist tendencies. The June 83 mob violence broke 
  the unstable equilibrium at which contradictory forces were interacting, struggling 
  and evolving. It set in motion at a tremendous pace, the process that was to 
  lead eventually to the October 1987 war. The destruction and chaos seem nothing 
  but a natural outcome. When the July 1983 mob violence against Tamils occurred 
  as a government engineered plan, India voiced its &quot;humanitarian&quot; concern. 
  </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>For the Sinhalese ruling class which had always feared 
  the espousal of the Tamil cause by India, these indications were seen in a paranoidal 
  manner. And the mainstream press and Sinhalese Buddhist organisations fanned 
  anti-Indian propaganda. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>India discerned a tangible advantage in using Tamil aspirations 
  for its own interests. The Indian government saw the armed liberation movements 
  as good vehicles for the destabilisation of the Sri Lankan state, with the aim 
  of checking the threats to its strategic interests,posed by Sri Lanka's moves. 
  Overtures were made by India offering to assist militarily the armed Tamil movements. 
  Though the Indian government's decision was never openly acknowledged, training 
  camps were being set up in India. However, India gave its political support 
  to the parliamentary party of the Tamils - the T.U.L.F.. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>In the meantime, Indian assistance was the talk of the 
  living rooms of expatriate Tamils in London, New York and Boston. The Indian 
  military assistance gave confidence to the expatriate community that a separate 
  state for the Tamils in Sri Lanka was a historical possibility, and a respectable 
  cause. From afar, they were ready to invest for a future. Standing order support 
  started to snowball for the Eelam cause. Luncheons, and dinner parties were 
  held to raise support for the armed groups. Those who raised funds for movements 
  became community leaders among the expatriates. Discussions were addressed by 
  political front-men from all the groups. The armed groups became monetarily 
  more sound and politically more important. Expatriate big wigs breezed in and 
  out of New Delhi and Madras, seeking appointments with Indira Gandhi, and talking 
  to Prabakaran and Uma Maheswaran in separate rooms. They were surprised, but 
  not disturbed by their inability to get the latter two into one room. Sri Lankan 
  Tamil platform speakers did the rounds in Tamil Nadu. An expatriate doctor from 
  the U.. S arrived with the Eelam flag designed by him and a commissioned recording 
  of the Tamil Eelam national anthem. Indian assistance spurred recruitment, and 
  swelled the ranks of all groups, thus bloating unnaturally the rather small 
  and infantile politico-military structures of the groups. The sweep of Indian 
  military assistance created shifts in political opinions and the class character 
  of the struggle became well established. It was after the '83 riots and Indian 
  help that taking up arms became popular with middle class youth. Though the 
  ideology of nationalism was that of the middle classes, and the rhetoric was 
  out of their consciousness, the harsh life underground, and the persecution 
  by the police did not make it appealing to the youth of this class in the early 
  days. Before 1983, the rank and file of the groups were young men mostly from 
  the oppressed and deprived sections of the community. However, 1983s gruesome 
  mob violence, the enormous suffering of the people and Indian assistance, tipped 
  the balance. In the process armed actions became the total focus of the struggle 
  among the groups and, in general, within the community. It unlinked political 
  accountability from military action, the fundamental experience of all people's 
  struggles. Liberation struggle became synonymous with armed action. And politics 
  took a back seat in the community and in the movements. But in India's interests, 
  the destabilisation of Sri Lanka could not be better organized than through 
  these politically stunted organizations. India organized the aid through the 
  R.A.W. (Research and Analysis Wing), and it was mainly in the form of training. 
  An empirical analysis of R.A.W.'s activities shows the trends in the political 
  thinking of the Indian state vis-a-vis the Tamil militant groups.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'>6.2.9        The R.A.W. and the Tamil Militant 
  Groups</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>The first group that was chosen for training was the 
  T.E.L.O.. The T.E.L.O. at that time was a handful of persons without a clear 
  cut organisational base or theoretical perspective. With Indian assistance the 
  T.E.L.O. became a front line armed group. Recruitment in Tamil Eelam commenced 
  on a massive scale. Once the training took off, the T.E.L.O. launched some daring 
  and successful armed raids on the Sri Lankan security forces. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>The scramble for military training offered by India intensified. 
  Five militants movements out of many were chosen by the R.A.W. and training 
  was offered separately as separate packages. The L.T.T.E. had always felt that 
  they had the moral right to leadership because they had sacrificed much in performing 
  many armed actions, and thus had suffered the most for the &quot;cause&quot;. 
  Moreover, their narrow nationalist ideology could not accommodate the existence 
  of other movements. They as a group denied the historical contribution of other 
  movements to the cause, and felt cheated when they were not chosen as the sole 
  beneficiary of the Indian assistance. This was one among the many reasons that 
  laid the foundations for their decision later to eliminate physically the competing 
  groups. Nevertheless the L.T.T.E. did not let its bitterness jeopardise its 
  relations with the R.A.W. or India. They, like the other movements, solicited 
  assiduously the military aid on offer. Moreover, the L.T.T.E. and all the other 
  major movements shored up their support by meshing their own with Tamil Nadu's 
  politics. Until the splits came into the open, all the movements were generally 
  referred to as &quot;Tigers&quot;. But it was predominantly, the L.T.T.E.'s 
  image of glamour and heroism that caught the popular imagination in Tamil Nadu. 
  </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>One did expect other movements like the E.P.R.L.F. and 
  the E.R.O.S. with left-wing leanings, to be more cautious about the Indian military 
  training, especially as they had criticised the L.T.T.E.'s military strategy. 
  But the reality was that the atmosphere of total focus was on military and armed 
  action. This proved too much of a pressure for these movements as well. They 
  lacked well organised politico-military strategies of their own to counter this 
  militaristic focus; and they also lacked the conceptual depth that was required 
  to handle the reality of India, and assess the pros and cons of Indian help. 
  Therefore they, like the others, surrendered to the Indian plan wholesale. Their 
  fault was not their receiving of military assistance, but their lack of a coherent 
  structure, a political theory, and popular base which made them unable to control 
  India's dominance and keep the initiative in their own hands. Thus, the slow 
  but steady surrender to India became their destiny.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>Therefore when we analyse the level of influence and 
  penetration of the R.A.W. into the movements, one aspect is clear. It is that 
  its influence is far reaching in all the movements. But the degree of penetration 
  varied. The T.E.L.O was fully penetrated. Others were able to keep a fair distance 
  from this secret service. the E.P.R.L.F. and the EROS had an ambivalent relationship 
  with it. The L.T.T.E. was the most resistant to R.A.W.influence among all five 
  groups. The Tigers who had evolved with the political history of the popular 
  nationalist movement in the homeland, had already built a tightly knit centralized 
  armed structure with fanatical dedication to the cause of their movement, and, 
  most of all, their leader. Therefore, though the L.T.T.E. was a reactionary 
  and stifling phenomenon, the R.A.W. found it difficult to penetrate it fully 
  or to destabilise its structure. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>The R.A.W. offered training in separate packages on different 
  terms to the different groups, and thus not only intensified intergroup rivalry, 
  but also ensured a diffused build up of trained personnel, so that no one movement 
  should get ahead of the others militarily. The dangerous and sad aspect of this 
  was that, using the antagonisms between groups to its advantage, the R.A.W. 
  collected information on the movements from each other. India also saw to it 
  that no movement could establish tangible connections with liberation struggles 
  elsewhere or with other countries. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>The conclusions we could derive from the above observations 
  are that, though the RAW and India wanted the growth of armed Tamil movements, 
  it was planned in such a way that none of them would be able to supersede the 
  other, and ultimately pose a threat to India or to Sri Lanka. They penetrated 
  the most politically naive of the movements, the T.E.L.O., and used them as 
  their agents. Their competitive offerings in action offset their greater internal 
  rivalries and fragmented support base. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>One gathers from all available reports that the R.A.W.'s 
  objective was to use the militant movements to exert pressure on the Sri Lankan 
  state to concede some of India's interests, together with some devolution to 
  the Tamils. Abortive instance of the latter was the Thimpu talks of 1985, where 
  the militants were said to have been &quot;frog marched&quot; to the talks by 
  the R.A.W., and the proposals of 19th December 1986. What was on offer was a 
  far cry from the militants' stated objective of Eelam- a separate Tamil state. 
  The effect of the R.A.W.'s involvement on the social and political consciousness 
  of the Tamils was an unmitigated disaster.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><b><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>6.2.10 Indian Training, the Nationalist Struggle </span></b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><b><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>of the Tamils and the Sri Lankan State </span></b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>The Indian military training saw to it that the movements 
  became more successful in containing the armed forces.On the other hand, the 
  Sri Lankan government with the loss of control of the North, sought to chip 
  away at the nationalist argument, and the territorial integrity of the Tamils 
  and thereby make Tamil Eelam a worthless claim. They made moves in the East, 
  the more fertile parts of Tamil Eelam, and escalated colonization in an effort 
  to change the demography of the region. From amongst the Sinhalese colonizers 
  they also built up such paramilitary corps as the home guards, who began to 
  carry out acts of violence against the indigenous Tamils. This started a frontier 
  type of war, especially in the Trincomalee district, and resulted in brutal 
  murders of Tamils and created conditions for a life of terror in the East. The 
  L.T.T.E. in response could not mount an organised defence of the indigenous 
  Tamils, but carried out retaliatory raids not only on the colonizers but even 
  on traditional Sinhalese villages outside the Tamil homelands committing brutal 
  acts of murder and arson. The restrained slogans of pre 1983-L.T.T.E., were 
  abandoned in favour of their instinctive emotional slogans. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>       Furthermore, the greater sophistication 
  of the liberation movements' armed activities, tied up the Sri Lankan government 
  head to foot in a destructive war which also crippled it economically. </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><b><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>6.2.11 National Consensus: A Facade</span></b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>Though many considered the period after Indian military 
  aid as one of progress in the Tamil nationalist struggle - the wresting of control 
  of the northern district within a mere three years - this apparent advance and 
  triumph is falsified by other aspects of the struggle. The Eastern province, 
  the other area of Tamil concentration, had remained for a long time outside 
  the sphere of Tamil nationalism. The Batticaloa Tamils and other Eastern province 
  Tamils were reluctant to join a struggle that was Jaffna dominated. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'>The growing entrenchment of the Sri Lankan military 
  in the East, and increasing the colonization, rendered the Eastern situation 
  more complex; the lack of vision on the part of the leading group, the L.T.T.E., 
  whose Eastern front was small seemed to have handed the Easterners on a platter 
  to the brutality of Sri Lankan S.T.F. and Homeguards, when the North was relatively 
  trouble free. This brought in further division and increased the basis of prejudice 
  between the North and the East, besides enhancing the anger and frustration 
  in the East at Northern hegemony and step motherly treatment. This shook the 
  cohesion that seemed to have developed after the 1983 anti-Tamil mob violence.          
</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>The development of the northern front occurred at the 
  expense of many fundamental tasks of nation building. The blind spot in the 
  concept of the Tamil nation was the question of two large sections of the Tamil 
  speaking people - the Muslims or the Islamic Tamils and the hill country (plantation) 
  Tamils. Tamil nationalism was the ideology of the Tamils of Sri Lanka. Historically, 
  it had very tenuous links with the ideology of the Islamic or hill country Tamils 
  of Sri Lanka. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>The case of the Islamic Tamils spotlights the weakness 
  of Tamil nationalism with clarity. They are a grouping with a unique economic, 
  socio-political structure, and cultural characteristics. Large sections of them 
  live in the East, with pockets of them well entrenched all over Sri Lanka, but 
  isolated from each other. The cohesive factor binding them is Islam, not Tamil. 
  Not only do they have historical contradictions specific to themselves with 
  the Sinhalese, but have suffered during anti-Tamil &quot;race riots&quot; as 
  well. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>Though the slogans and programmes of all movements paid 
  lip service to the rights of Muslims, there has never been a concrete programme 
  to realise their goals, or the articulation of their needs and objectives during 
  the process of the struggle. What has been proclaimed is a programme designed 
  by the Tamils for the Muslims. There are immense contradictions and prejudices 
  between Tamils and Muslims, which should have been handled during the years 
  of struggle, a common basis built and an organic cohesion produced. What we 
  have is tokenism, some tenuous slogans, a token presence of Muslims in the movements 
  and the imposition of the hegemony of the Tamils (especially peninsula Tamils) 
  which led to increasing contradictions. Therefore the advance of the Northern 
  front was a facade. Internally,the inner core of the nation was cleaved, and 
  many sections were inarticulate, isolated and in disarray. This situation was 
  successfully used by the Sri Lankan government to increase the animosity between 
  the Tamils and Muslims by even arming small groups of Muslim youths to escalate 
  the conflict. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>Not only was the nation cleaved on a regional basis, 
  but also the intensified inter-group rivalries, ultimately culminated in the 
  L.T.T.E. annihilating group after group with brutality unparalleled in the history 
  of liberation struggles. This led the community to be broken into dissenting 
  segments. Their discontent and hatred were reduced to sullen silence by the 
  terror of the L.T.T.E. and other leading movements. We were not only losing 
  on the home front, but there was a slow and steady erosion of international 
  support, as brutalities within and between groups and against Sinhalese were 
  on the increase. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>One detrimental aspect of Indian assistance was found 
  in all movements, especially in those where armed actions formed the total axis 
  (like the Tigers and the T.E.L.O.). In them the military machinery grew out 
  of proportion to the political structure The structures were neither dependent 
  nor connected to the people of the land. And there was hardly any accountability 
  to the people. This lack of accountability was partly the reason why movements 
  like the Tigers could pursue brutal supremacist struggles, while those like 
  the P.L.O.T.E. and the T.E.L.O. indulged in large scale torture and murder of 
  dissidents with impunity. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>The Tigers not only brutally eliminated other movements, 
  but they also suppressed any other opinion among the people. All peoples organisations 
  were terrorised into toeing the line by the power of the gun. Very soon many 
  civilian organisations such as the Jaffna mothers' front, trade unions, citizens' 
  committees, teachers' unions and the local press that were all started through 
  the independent initiative of the people, were either suppressed or appropriated 
  by the L.T.T.E.. Though the L.T.T.E. seemed to have ascended to dominance, it 
  was not an organic growth. It was achieved by terror. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>Although all movements talked of India only as a rear 
  base, none of them inclusive of the L.T.T.E., could establish any real autonomy 
  from India organisationally. This was principally due to the fact that none 
  of them seriously considered de-linking themselves from India, and building 
  alternative structures, organising the people towards self-sufficiency-economically 
  or socially or politically - to at least a limited extent. This dependency afforded 
  India scope to use a carrot and stick method with Tamil militant groups in its 
  political and diplomatic manoeuvres with the Sri Lankan government. From Thimpu 
  to the 29 July Peace Accord, the Tamil movements had no autonomy. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><b><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>6.2.12 Negotiation: Anathema</span></b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>The seemingly successful period of the Tamil militant 
  groups was interspersed with armed actions against Sinhalese villages as a reprisal 
  to the state's activity in Tamil areas. This led to a Sinhalese chauvinist backlash 
  and gave a greater momentum to the forces of reaction within the southern political 
  scene. The resurgence of the J.V.P., the rise of the M.E.P. and the chauvinistic 
  tilt of the S.L.F.P. are classic examples of how narrow nationalism became a 
  relevant ideology despite the onward march of the country towards capitalist 
  progress for almost a decade. Due to the increasing neocolonialist penetration 
  and dependency under the Jayewardene government, the Sinhalese nation was experiencing 
  a disintegration of social structures, relations and values. This coupled with 
  Sinhalese anger at the government's inability to smash the L.T.T.E., resulted 
  in a resurgence of petit bourgeois militancy. The content of this new militancy 
  was narrow nationalism, romanticism and the glorification of the past and traditional 
  feudal values. The remarkable rise of the J.V.P. on the populist crest in recent 
  times, signals the revival of narrow nationalism with a new vigour. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>Though it is apparent that a rational approach to the 
  national crisis lay in finding a political solution between the leaderships 
  of both communities and thus reducing the possibility of Indian involvement, 
  the Government caught in the trap of its own ideology, could envisage participation 
  in negotiations only from a position of strength vis-a-vis the Tigers. That 
  is why negotiations set up at the dictates of India and pressure from the international 
  community, were a failure. And the state continued to build up its military 
  potential. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>As the first step, the Sri Lankan state launched its 
  first offensive to wrench control of the North. The defence of the Tamils was 
  weakened by the internal killings, which made it difficult for the L.T.T.E. 
  to sustain the fight and it had to withdraw, losing its control over the crucial 
  border areas, and the land connection with the East. Though the L.T.T.E. still 
  had its bases and moved fairly freely, its earlier position of free access was 
  heavily curtailed. The Tiger control zone shrunk to the peninsula, north of 
  Elephant-Pass. This success gave a psychological boost to the Sri Lankan security 
  forces. A military solution and negotiation from a position of strength were 
  becoming a reality for the Sri Lankan state while India's December 19th proposals 
  were on the table. This was a heavy blow to the Tigers who also would have preferred 
  a position of strength before any negotiation. The Sri Lankan state started 
  its relentless pressure on the Tamil support base. An economic blockade was 
  imposed and sporadic aerial bombardment of so called Tiger camps preluded the 
  final offensive - the so called Operation Liberation. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>As the time bomb exploded in the commercial heartland 
  of Colombo on 21 April 1987, the conquest of the Jaffna peninsula was on the 
  cards - the ensuing frenzy of the Sinhalese-chauvinist platforms demanded it. 
  </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><b><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>6.2.13 Operation Liberation or The June War</span></b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>On the surface it looked a success for the Sri Lankan 
  state. It had smashed a stronghold of the Tigers, the vanguard area of Tamil 
  nationalism - Vadamaratchi. But the war itself and the manner in which it was 
  conducted brought about an international outcry. India stepped up its &quot;moral&quot; 
  pressure, and, by a show of strength rather than by physical invasion, aborted 
  the final Sri Lankan onslaught on the heavily populated Jaffna city and its 
  hinterland. Sri Lanka's allies threatened economic sanctions and demanded a 
  political solution. On the Tamil side, the L.T.T.E. and the Tamil nationalist 
  cause were never in such a defensive position. The Tiger control zone had been 
  whittled down to a corner of the Jaffna peninsula. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'>On the other hand, India had never found a more 
  opportune time for the offer of its &quot;good&quot; offices. It offered the 
  Sri Lankan government the final package, put in clear cut terms its strategic 
  needs, reiterated the sovereignty of Sri Lanka and pushed the solution down 
  the throats of the Tigers. To the world at large, it took away the image of 
  Indian expansionism and portrayed India as a genuine &quot;peace keeper&quot;. 
  To the war weary Tamil community,  peace seemed a sweet reality.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><b><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>6.2.14 The Peace Accord</span></b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>When the Peace Accord was signed, 
  there was euphoria in the Tamil community. But the L.T.T.E. could not rationalize 
  the Accord to its cadres. The Tiger leadership had been pushed into accepting 
  it. </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><b>But such a position was taken while the Tigers 
  were at their lowest and in their most defensive position. The Tiger leadership 
  had erred partly because of certain misconceptions in constructing their relationship 
  with India. They had surmised that India's political aspirations in the region 
  would cause it to look for agents for the destabilisation of pro-Western Sri 
  Lanka. They had openly spoken on platforms about the Tamil struggle and  their 
  &quot;Movement&quot; having given this opening for India into Sri Lanka, and 
  said that Tamil Eelam as a separate state would continue to be friendly to India 
  and thus ensure the existence of India's control over south Sri Lanka. This 
  perception was based on some ideas prevalent amongst Tamil intellectuals. With 
  this perception they could not grasp the reality behind India's continuous reiteration 
  of the fact that it respected the territorial integrity and unity of Sri Lanka.</b><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'> </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>Some Western analysts saw India's opposition to a separate 
  linguistic state as stemming from a fear that it would give impetus to nationalist 
  movements within its own borders. Though one cannot deny that this is an important 
  aspect of India's perception, it is more important to analyse it in terms of 
  the economic and strategic defence needs of the Indian ruling class. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>Though India found the pro-Western defence alliances 
  of Sri Lanka detrimental to its interests, the free economic policies of the 
  Sri Lankan government were in fact a boon to the interests of Indian capital. 
  As we mentioned earlier the development of capitalism in India was stimulating 
  it to look abroad for markets, especially in the South Asian region. To compete 
  with Japan, the West, and the newly industrialised countries India needed to 
  modernise and refine its technology and its management and marketing techniques. 
  Moreover, the big capitalists of India (such as Tata and Birla) were expanding 
  their business interests at an international level and linking up with big multinational 
  companies. Already India had made sizable investments in Sri Lanka's Free Trade 
  Zone and its banking sector. The suggestion that Sri Lanka might become what 
  a Hong Kong is for China, is not so far from the truth when we take into consideration 
  the above facts. Therefore, the maintenance of a stable united Sri Lanka with 
  policies that satisfy India's economic expansion and defence requirements, would 
  be India's objective. Thus, it is not surprising that in the Peace Accord, the 
  letters and annexures which deal with Indian interests are well defined in minute 
  detail, while the part dealing with several key issues of the national question, 
  is vague and given only in broad outline. On the Sri Lankan side, one could 
  rationally view the Peace Accord as affording J.R. Jayewardene a solution or 
  at least an escape from the grip of chauvinism, giving foreign investment a 
  spur and the economy a truly capitalist impetus. However, it was not to be so. 
  </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>However, Sri Lanka was to be continually confounded by 
  the paradox that existed between its ideology and the economy. Though the economic 
  programme was capitalist, its political existence depended on a reactionary 
  ideology that was anti-Tamil and vehemently anti-India. Thus the populist forces 
  in south Sri Lanka shouted &quot;sell-out&quot; when the peace accord was signed. 
  This stage need not have arisen if the U.N.P. had sought a rational solution, 
  and explained to the electorate the impending Indian problem if the national 
  crisis was not neutralized. For neutralization it had to produce a programme 
  for decentralization and give certain powers to the Tamils in the North and 
  East and ensure the territorial integrity of the Tamil homelands without total 
  division of the country. It could have allayed the fears of the Sinhalese majority 
  and accommodated Tamil aspirations to work towards a rational bourgeois solution. 
  Their irrational and military approach had given India a powerful role, albeit 
  an apparently peaceful one, to play. This enabled it to gain a foothold in Sri 
  Lanka without being seen as aggressive. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>On the other hand, the Tamil nationalist struggle under 
  the L.T.T.E. leadership had gone on a path of internal destruction and terror, 
  alienating and cleaving the community. It was failing in its objective by not 
  conceptualising the needs of a struggle whose primary objective was creating 
  a self-sufficient, autonomous state (as far as possible) out of an inextricably 
  linked Sri Lanka. It was falling short by not perceiving India's true aspirations. 
  The result was a failure to construct any means of dealing with the geopolitical 
  reality that avoided total dependency and capitulation. The L.T.T.E. could not 
  grasp, even at this late hour, that &quot;Tamil Eelam&quot; had ironically been 
  rendered an empty slogan, at least to some extent, by their own efforts. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>The urgent need here was to work for a rational solution 
  to save the Tamil nation from total Indian hegemony and Sri Lankan control. 
  The surrender of the island to the manipulations of a regional power resulted 
  from the intolerance and intransigence of narrow nationalist forces on both 
  sides. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><b><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>6.2.15 The Left: A viable Alternative ?</span></b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>Last but not least of our failings was the lack of a 
  viable alternative to counter this narrow nationalism: a third force. And that 
  brings us to the Left. So far we have not outlined the evolution of this small 
  but politically and historically important force in both communities. But we 
  wish to draw out some observations. It is the failure of this force historically 
  that had cleared the way for the ascendency of narrow nationalism to the core 
  of our political life. The Left had the capacity to lead us out of this quagmire. 
  As early as 1947, at the congress of the Communist Party of Ceylon, a resolution 
  calling for regional autonomy for Tamils was put forward. In the debates against 
  the one language policy of S.W.R.D..Bandaranaike in 1956, the Lanka Sama Samaja 
  Party ( the Trotskyite left party) and the C.P.'s enlightened position on the 
  parity of languages and its prophetic pronouncements regarding the future - 
  &quot;One language two nations, two languages one nation &quot; - stand as landmarks 
  and show the role the Left could have played. It is their subsequent, capitulation 
  and lack of creativity that lost the initiative to nationalists.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>In the contemporary neocolonialist era, the traditional 
  nationalists such as the T.U.L.F., because of their weak economic base, cannot 
  successfully lead a national struggle towards liberation without capitulating 
  to imperialism. They have no real independent economic power and this leads 
  them one way or another to become integrated and dependent on international 
  capital. The only way they can sustain their nationalist aspirations (stemming 
  from colonial and now neocolonial domination) is by adopting a rhetorical and 
  emotional ideology. Essentially a section of the ruling class uses this to consolidate 
  its power. It is apparent that only a force that represents the interests of 
  the broad masses of the working population, and is therefore opposed to the 
  economic dependence on foreign capital, could design a strategy and a concretised 
  programme to limit the neocolonial penetration and thus lay the foundation for 
  a national economic base. Because our economy was already integrated with international 
  capital and because of specific features of our social formation, the national 
  struggle required a creative and far sighted leadership for a consistent struggle 
  against the forces of reaction. This was not given.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>The Sri Lankan Left's base has been traditionally in 
  the urban working class. The leadership comprised petit bourgeois intellectuals 
  who held a Marxist perspective. They were at one time able to predict the development 
  of the national question. But in time, when they opted to participate in the 
  parliamentary process, they had to accommodate the force of Sinhalese Buddhist 
  nationalism. Their entry into electoral politics abandoning all other forms 
  of struggle, coincided with the powerful revival of Sinhalese Buddhist nationalism 
  which tapped the populist consciousness of the people, especially from the rural 
  base. Since the Left had never represented the rural poor, this base rejected 
  them decisively. In this way a large section of the population was abandoned 
  to the bourgeois political parties' control. The Left, in a desperate attempt 
  to consolidate what ever was left to them, made recourse to the Sinhalese chauvinist 
  line themselves, further eroding their strength. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>The lack of clear political leadership among the leftist 
  forces was not only due to their urban bias, petit bourgeois leadership and 
  capitulation to the parliamentary path. The crisis within the international 
  communist movement and the great debate in the 1960s about the future was another 
  factor. The split in the communist movement fragmented the left forces in Sri 
  Lanka. Most of the fragmented left parties dogmatically and mechanically applied 
  experiences of revolutionary struggles in other parts of the world and isolated 
  themselves from the masses in both communities. Their theoretical outlook and 
  internal party struggles were products of mechanical imposition and the adoption 
  of frameworks developed in the international communist movements. The dominance 
  of the Soviet Union and China in the Communist movement also played a great 
  role in narrowing and stereotyping the outlook of these movements. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>The major extra-parliamentary left - wing party was the 
  Communist Party (Peking Wing), which gathered together the most radical and 
  militant elements of the Sri Lankan Left. Unlike the parliamentary Left, it 
  had a power base amongst certain sections of the oppressed castes in Jaffna 
  where pitched battles against caste oppression had been waged in the mid - 1960s. 
  The majority of left-leaning intellectuals amongst Tamils were also with the 
  Communist Party (Peking). It was also the first left party to build up a solid 
  base among the hill country plantation Tamils. Despite all this, it was also 
  not totally immune to Sinhalese chauvinism. It failed to comprehend the primacy 
  of the national question in the politics of the island and left the fighting 
  for the rights of the Tamils in the hands of the Tamil bourgeois parties. It 
  had no coherent line linking class struggle with the national question. Therefore 
  it could not consolidate its base amongst the hill country Tamils and the Sri 
  Lankan Tamils. This error in its theoretical understanding of class struggle 
  in the Sri Lankan context, led the party to just drift along with the events 
  and merely respond to the measures that the state was taking. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>As a result it began to lose support and to disintegrate 
  in the late 1960s. The fragmentation occurred over the theoretical conflict 
  regarding the legitimacy and nature of armed struggle. The efficacy of armed 
  struggle and the political and strategic means of conducting armed activities 
  against the state also had to be tested and proved. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>The strength of the J.V.P. lay in the fact that it adopted 
  the powerful weapon of Sinhalese Buddhist Nationalism. Its leader, Rohana Wijeweera 
  had broken away from the Communist Party. The famous &quot;five classes&quot; 
  conducted by the J.V.P. included the topic of Indian expansionism in which the 
  hill country Tamils were portrayed as India's fifth column. Their anti-Tamil 
  stance gave renewed vigour to the racist feeling of the petit-bourgeois rural 
  youth in the south of the country. The J.V.P. gained much ground by raising 
  this patriotic cry, mixed with Marxist rhetoric. This culminated in the 1971 
  insurrection which was crushed brutally by the regime of Mrs.Bandaranaike, who 
  was later on an ally of the J.V.P. for a short time during the aftermath of 
  signing of the Peace Accord. in 1987. The 1971 youth insurrection was limited 
  only to the Sinhalese South. The North and East watched it passively. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>       When the Tamil youth were 
  getting ready to launch their armed campaign against the state in the mid-1970s, 
  the Sri Lankan Left was nowhere to be seen. Thus the leadership of a struggle 
  that would create the most decisive political crisis in the history of Sri Lanka 
  slowly and steadily passed into the hands of narrow nationalism. And it is also 
  clear that it is the Left's internal weakness and contradictions that provided 
  the primary means for external forces to infiltrate their way to controlling 
  the nation.</p>

  man in Jaffna, “Be happy that you are alive”. Yes, in this brutal war, to be 
  dead was your right, to live was your privilege. In the terror stricken nights 
  of those October days, listening to the continual whizz of the shells, the pounding 
  of great big cannon, the roar of the tracked vehicle and the sharp piercing 
  crack of automatic weapons - to be alive seemed a privilege. Days would dawn 
  and nights filled with fear, would drag, not even knowing what the morrow would 
  bring.</span> </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'>The nation was on the roads, their worldly belongings 
  in plastic bags, their children on their hips, in the blistering noon day heat, 
  from refugee camp to refugee camp, from village to village, fleeing from the 
  withdrawing Tigers and the advancing army. This was 12 - 20 October 1987,<span style='font-size:10.0pt'> 
  in the central Jaffna villages of Kopay and Urumpirai where the war was raging. 
  We heard the women say:</span></p>
<p style='
text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>&quot;...my children, run to safety, do not linger any 
  longer, tell your father that I am dead... we left our mother, shot by the army, 
  to die and walked away.”</span></p>
<p style='
text-align:justify;'><span> </span>“..we stood still, motionless. I gave my breast 
  to the baby to suck, to keep it quiet. The firing continued all around us unabated. 
  I thought we were as good as dead.</p>
<p style='
text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>“..when we fled in panic from the raining shells and 
  firing we stepped over bodies, lying on the roads.”</span></p>
<p style='
text-align:justify;'><span> </span>“..I cycled fearfully and furiously, everywhere 
  along the road I could see only smashed up houses and bodies on the road - the 
  smell was unbearable.”</p>
<p style='

  to be dead...for 18 hours.”</p>
<p style='
text-align:justify;'><span

<p style='

<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>In those early days of the war, successful landmine attacks 
  took in fair numbers of Indian army jawans. During the heroics of 12 October, 
  29 Indian commandos had died. Many spoke with a swagger: </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>“The Boys are doing great. The fourth biggest military 
  power in the world is humbled.”</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>But as days advanced, what the heroics brought down was 
  the stamp of the Indian boot with unrestrained brutality, and the sacrificial 
  pyre consumed people in great numbers. Then came the shells, cannon, tank fire, 
  helicopter fire and even bombs from the Sri Lankan bombers. When Tiger sentry 
  point after sentry point withdrew without a whimper, only firing rounds of automatic 
  fire thereby luring the Indian army, the people were the sacrifice. The brave 
  talk sounded empty and hollow.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>21 October was the day of the massacre at the hospital. 
  The Tigers were there: maybe it was a deliberate ploy on the part of the L.T.T.E.. 
  They came in two lots. When the doctors had pleaded with them to leave, the 
  Tigers went away only after firing some rounds widely and leaving some weapons 
  inside. The Indian army came an hour or so later, at which time there was no 
  retaliatory fire. But they stormed the hospital and brutally killed, taking 
  the lives of the sick and those who were caring for the sick in and around the 
  area. The killing went on throughout the evening, night and the next morning. 
  </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>The pattern became established - the Tigers would lure, 
  and sometimes kill a few jawans. Then the Indian army would run berserk - shoot, 
  stab, molest and rape. It was unarmed defenceless people who were paying the 
  price. The famed cadjan fences of Jaffna were burnt; sometimes whole settlements 
  of huts were burnt. Invariably houses, and public buildings were shelled or 
  bombed. Kondavil, Kokuvil, Urumpirai, Kopay, Manipay, Sandilipay, Pandatheruppu, 
  Chavakachcheri, Suthumalai....there was hardly any village to tell a different 
  story. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><b>6.3.2       Terror: The Peacekeeper's Tool of 
  Control</b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>These reprisals were not a momentary display of anger 
  at the scene of the death of a fellow jawan, nor an aspect of indiscipline of 
  a massive army. It seemed to be a tactical part of the strategy. A responsible 
  officer told some senior citizens:</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>“If the Tiger chaps are here, and even if one jawan dies, 
  we will scorch this place.”</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>And this was not an isolated comment; in every village, 
  in every street corner, the officers gave the people the same message. What 
  can we surmise, except that reprisal raids were part of the strategy - to give 
  a message of Terror. Terror is now the law of the land. It did work, it does 
  work: but for how long? </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>It was not only that the hospital operation was conducted 
  with callous disregard for the human cost, or that terror was a tactic and reprisal 
  raids were the order of the day. The entire community felt degraded as their 
  women faced molestation on a large scale on the excuse of checking for arms 
  at sentry points, in people's own homes and in the refugee camps. Raping, not 
  just by one, sometimes by two and in one instance by three. To scream was the 
  only defence the women had against this monstrosity. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>Even in matters of less importance, the Indian Army showed 
  complete disregard. As Jaffna was being taken, they announced over the radio 
  that the entire population should go to three places for refuge: two schools 
  and the Nallur Kovil (temple). Out of these, the Nallur Kovil did not even have 
  sanitary facilities. At one point there were twenty to thirty thousand people 
  at the temple, in the drenching monsoon rain without any shelter. No functioning 
  hospital, no drugs. The children were dying of diarrhoea and fever. For the 
  Indian Army it was military action. Operations had to be done and the people 
  in these areas did not matter much or were just an after thought. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>The people were the killing fodder not only for the occupying 
  Indian Army, but also for the Tigers. It seems a strange twist that the so called 
  leaders of the people wanted them to die defenceless. Invariably the Tigers 
  have used the vicinities of refugee camps as places to mount attacks from (Kokuvil 
  Hindu college where 34 people died is an example) and then withdraw at great 
  cost to the people left behind. They turned a deaf ear to the people's sufferings 
  and their entreaties. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>They continued to lure the army, just to run away, letting 
  the people face the result. It was cruellest of all when they told the people 
  that another 500 to 1000 must die for them to have a viable international publicity 
  campaign. This was not an isolated instance or the statement of a group without 
  contact with the leadership. It was pronounced at many places and in many forms. 
  When the people were starving, wandering around like dogs for rice, the Tigers 
  issued leaflets asking the people to boycott Indian distributed food. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>When the children were dying with diseases, they threatened 
  those who cared for them, ordering them not to issue Indian drugs. Did they 
  offer alternatives, so that we could eat Tiger food and give our children Tiger 
  drugs ? Many important and searching questions surfaced during the crisis. How 
  was it that the movement that claimed to be the leaders of the people, acted 
  with such a disregard for the people? Why did they choose this path of bull-like 
  collision, well knowing our defenceless position? Why did they not understand 
  that the task of rescuing the nation from Indian military and political domination, 
  from the present position of weakness, would entail enormous creativity and 
  not simple slogans and rhetorical, intransigent positions? One has to search 
  in the roots of the Tigers to explain these aspects of our history. Though many 
  factors contributed to this short-sightedness, some aspects of Tiger psychology 
  are pertinent.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><b>6.3.3       The Messiahs and the People</b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>The Tigers were a historical product of nationalist ideology 
  and saw themselves as its legitimate representatives. They grew voicing the 
  disenchantment of the youth, rebelling against the bankruptcy and hypocrisy 
  of Tamil nationalist leaders in parliamentary politics. They held in contempt 
  their slick lawyer politics and verbose debates and decided to replace them 
  with action. They emphasised an action oriented programme and built an organisation 
  centred on a tightly knit centralised armed group. Altruism, nationalist ardour, 
  determination and rebelliousness were marks of the youth who made up the core. 
  Dedication to the slogan of Tamil Eelam, and more so to the “Movement” was the 
  central axis of the organisation. Anything could be justified in the name of 
  the sacred “Movement”. This elevated religious sense was nurtured in all its 
  members. They performed daring armed actions, and propelled history by a kind 
  of politics of heroism - the L.T.T.E.'s politics of heroism had individual heroes 
  going forward, holding the banner and doing the impossible. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>The guiding ideology was a nationalism of extreme narrowness, 
  deriving its energies from primitive instinctive loyalties - in our case to 
  language and race. Romantic, idealised imagery and rhetorical slogans appealing 
  to the anger and emotions of the nation were the core content of this ideology. 
  Behind the slogans, there is an emptiness - the classic example is the slogan 
  of “Tamil Eelam”. Though the Tigers saw themselves as the vanguard of this nation 
  and the leaders of an incipient separate state, they did not explore any of 
  the fundamentals of nation building. Nor did they expose the present social 
  weaknesses, or grasp the weakness of the economic base of the Tamil nation, 
  dependent on and inextricably linked to the South and the state machinery. Nor 
  did they address the contradictions arising from regional minority groups, besides 
  class and caste differences. They had no coherent policy to lead the people 
  to overcome these divisions during the struggle. Taking the case of external 
  factors, though they assiduously sought India's help and protection, they had 
  no concept of the geopolitical context and the thrust of Indian hegemony.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>They had no theory or analytical framework to explore 
  complexities. They preferred simply formulated answers and fed the people with 
  simple solutions. Their simplicity had an appeal and earthiness. Their people's 
  politics emanated from the satiation of populist desires, fears and sentiments. 
  The other side of the history of such ideological groups is that their idealised, 
  emotional content leads to fanaticism, since the imagery is in absolutes - the 
  Nation, the Language, and the Movement. They are intolerant of others - other 
  nationalities, groups and opinions. They possess a sense of greatness and of 
  awe inspiring duty - which rationalises and purifies even brutality. As one 
  woman dissident aptly described, </span></p>
<p style='
text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>“Thambi (Prabakaran, leader of the L.T.T.E.) had a sense 
  of history, a Messianic fervour, and this marked him out as a leader from the 
  start. But these characteristics in the man who had only an idealised and narrow 
  ideology led to fanaticism and brutality.” </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>This woman further exemplified both the appealing and 
  the reactionary sides in two quotations from Prabakaran taken from talks given 
  to his men: </span></p>
<p style='
text-align:justify;'>1.             “Only a good cook is a good fighter” (when 
  men in his movement thought cooking was degrading) </p>
<p style='
text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>and </span></p>
<p style='
text-align:justify;'>2.             “Politics is there to explain armed action. 
  Not to guide it.” </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>A.S. Balasingham, the so-called &quot;theoretician'&quot; 
  of the L.T.T.E., played the assigned role to perfection.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>The most poignant aspect of this idealized doctrine was 
  the heroism of suicide. The unique characteristic of the Tigers is the swallowing 
  of cyanide, when they are captured. This act was proclaimed to be sublime, the 
  utmost sacrifice to their cause. It was glorified by the nation as an unparalleled 
  act of dedication in the history of liberation struggles. However, cyanide signified 
  a suicidal urge, to escape from reality, for those who could not handle material 
  reality and its complexities. For an individual member this was an escape from 
  the reality of persecution and torture, in place of building the will to overcome. 
  For an organisation, this served as a means of not addressing objective reality. 
  Given some imagined aspirations and needs, this state of the psyche, through 
  a process of rationalisation, led increasingly to annihilatory ends. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>It used to be wondered how a materialistic society such 
  as obtains in Jaffna raised up idealistic youths who were prepared to give up 
  everything for such a cause. Superficially, this may seem a paradox. But at 
  a deeper level, this materialistic urge and this narrow idealism, are two sides 
  of the same coin, whose workings are closely linked. People in certain circumstances, 
  because of the narrowness of their perception, come to identify certain privileges 
  and rights as being central to their existence. These values are propagated 
  by a dominant section which sets the cultural mores. These values themselves 
  have their roots in historical, social and economic factors. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>When those rights and privileges that are deemed central 
  to the community's existence are challenged, it creates amongst those affected 
  a build up of idealist emotions, giving them the ability to fight back blindly 
  with remarkable will - power. But these idealist notions have no material base 
  to stand on. This leads to fanaticism. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>In the case, especially, of the Jaffna Tamils, they had 
  developed a system where education and jobs in the lower and middle reaches 
  of the white collar government sector had become vitally important. Success 
  in this became tied up with prestige, and financially well endowed and well 
  connected brides. Discrimination in university admissions from 1971 challenged 
  a right that had become indispensable to the Tamils. This need not have been 
  the case, for the farming sector had begun to do well, and land, together with 
  bank loans, was available. But making the change in the economic base was, perhaps 
  for reasons of inertia, not publicly contemplated. Instead, the ideal state 
  of Eelam came to be thought of as the answer to Tamil ills. Amongst the first 
  to push this were those who were university students in the early 1970s. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>Even with the liberation groups Eelam was no more than 
  a slogan. They made no practical moves to create a material base, that would 
  give flesh and blood to the concept of Eelam. For instance, none of the groups, 
  for all their criticisms of the old leadership and their militant activity, 
  had any grasp of the dimensions of the colonization problem, which was crucial 
  to the integrity of the homeland. They had not developed any means of resettling 
  Tamils in the East, nor could they do anything constructive to stop the colonisation 
  programme of the state. Brutal and sadistic reprisal killings of Sinhalese settlers 
  and villagers was their answer. This made mere existence itself, for Tamils 
  in those areas, terror ridden and unbearable, as Sri Lanka's Special Task Force 
  and the Homeguards took their revenge unresisted.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>The plantation workers on the other hand, had very little 
  to do with the national struggle except to be targets of Sinhalese mob violence. 
  Almost all the groups mustered a few slogans about the plantation Tamils for 
  their political convenience, but did not take any great pains to incorporate 
  them into the struggle and left them undefended. The increasing fanaticism of 
  the L.T.T.E. and the transient hysteria amongst its supporters, must be seen 
  in the context of its unrealistic programme to achieve Eelam. The L.T.T.E.'s 
  political objectives and the strategic means it employed were quite divorced 
  from objective reality. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>The narrow idealism of these groups had a specific dialectic 
  in their relation to people. It is often repeated that “the people support the 
  Tigers” - that the Tigers appeal to a cross section of the Tamil society, and 
  that they reflect their emotion and pride. What exactly is this relationship 
  of the Tigers to the people? Lenin wrote a leaflet criticising the Socialist-Revolutionary 
  Party, which was a merger of several Narodnik groups and circles, advocating 
  armed action in the absence of ground work amongst the masses. On the subject 
  of the theory of excitative terrorism, he wrote: </span></p>
<p style='
'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>&quot;Each time a hero engages in single combat, this 
  arouses in us all a spirit of struggle and courage, we are told. But we know 
  from the past and see in the present, that only new forms of the mass movement 
  or the awakening of new sections of the masses to independent struggle really 
  rouses a spirit of struggle and courage in all. Single combat, however, in as 
  much as it remains single combat waged by the Balmashoves, has the immediate 
  effect of simply creating a short-lived sensation, while indirectly it even 
  leads to apathy and passive waiting for the next bout.&quot; </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>The dialectic portrayed by Lenin is an apt description 
  of the Tigers as well. However, in the case of the Tigers, not only was there 
  no organic link with the people who were just passive spectators, but more importantly, 
  people were held in contempt. This made the Tigers refer to the people as “Sheep”. 
  This attitude made the Tigers disregard the people’s criticism. The disenchantment 
  and resentment of the people, came into the open in those dark days of October. 
  Ultimately as events revealed in those desperate hours, even the lives of people 
  lost their significance for the Tigers. The Tigers often claimed that the 658 
  of their members who died during the struggle were the only martyrs for the 
  Tamil cause. The thousands of people who died during the military offensives, 
  and the cadres from other groups were all non-existent for them. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>In their theoretical documents, the L.T.T.E. claimed 
  their relationship with the people was as fish to the sea. But the sacrifice 
  of the people who were their protective wall against penetration by the state's 
  security forces; who provided the militants with food and shelter; who provided 
  them with hiding places against the ever hovering threat of Sri Lankan secret 
  services; who risked everything to succour them in those early days; was never 
  appreciated nor commemorated. Individuals and people were used, as the Tigers 
  used the deaths of ordinary civilians to campaign against the Sri Lankan state 
  in international fora. Martyrdom was a private preserve of the L.T.T.E.. The 
  offshoot of this kind of politics was that raising of the people’s consciousness, 
  came to mean an appeal to the most instinctive and emotional levels of existence. 
  As the period of Thileepan's fast showed, the Tigers aroused in the people an 
  emotional hysteria where people deified Thileepan and at his death were ready 
  to commit any act, even brutal murder and arson. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>To recapitulate, L.T.T.E. had an ideology based on the 
  most instinctive, emotional aspects of ethnic loyalties which was intolerant 
  of others, and had an overwhelming sense of its own greatness. This ideology 
  did not provide them with the necessary apparatus to handle complexities. Therefore 
  they could only view the internal and external contradictions in a simple framework, 
  and offered only simple solutions. Their politics ascribed a marginal role for 
  the people - and if they mobilised the people, it was at a basic emotional level 
  so as to only advance the narrow cause of their movement.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span><b>6.3.4      The L.T.T.E.: India's 
  Prodigal Son</b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>Against this background, if we view L.T.T.E.'s relationship 
  with India, its somersaults and ultimate collision, a certain clarity emerges. 
  The L.T.T.E.'s sense of greatness, and the feeling that they were the bearers 
  of the torch of Tamil nationalism, made them feel that they had the moral right 
  to leadership. This was enhanced by the fact that they believed they had sacrificed 
  the most to build a basis for the armed struggle. This perception made them 
  feel angry that India expected power sharing between groups and that India questioned 
  their supremacy. Their anti-Indianism started on that score and had little to 
  do with the interests of the Tamil people. Certain incidents throw light on 
  the contradictory position of the L.T.T.E. vis-a-vis India. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>In late June 1987, when Indian officials were ceremonially 
  welcomed by the L.T.T.E. following the airdrop of 4 June and the aborted third 
  phase of Operation Liberation, the L.T.T.E. handed over a memorandum asking 
  the Indian government to recognize the L.T.T.E. as the sole representative of 
  the Tamil people and Prabakaran as their leader. The Tiger controlled media 
  went into euphoria stating that India would recognise only the biggest movement 
  - namely the L.T.T.E.. When India dropped food parcels from the air, Tiger spokesmen, 
  including Prabakaran, thanked India and expressed their appreciation of the 
  action. How ironical it is that they are now asking the people not to receive 
  any Indian food and are murdering individuals liaising between the I.P.K.F. 
  and the people for basic amenities. When the Accord was in the offing, they 
  denounced other movements as traitors for supporting the Accord. But later, 
  when Prabhakaran was taken by helicopter on 24 July 1987 to talk about the Peace 
  Accord by the Indian authorities, the same media again proclaimed a great victory 
  and announced the recognition for the L.T.T.E. as the leading movement. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>The somersaults in their political line prove that their 
  anti-Indianism was not due to the realisation of the total potential of Indian 
  thrust for dominance, but was rather due to the shallow individualised politics 
  of supremacy of the movement and its leader. This was also an offshoot of their 
  intolerance of other groups and opinions. To achieve this narrow end they could 
  inspire their members’ blinkered dedication, to acts of extreme commitment. 
  Thus Thileepan the Tiger went on a suicidal fast and the nation went on a bout 
  of hysteria when the interim government was being planned. The propaganda line 
  was that the fast was being held for five broad demands. Ironically another 
  movement's, (E.R.O.S.'s) initiative on similar demands was obstructed by the 
  Tigers. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>The Tigers stopped the Jaffna University students participating 
  in the march organised by E.R.O.S. and diverted two bus loads of people who 
  were going for the E.R.O.S. march to Nallur, where Thileepan was fasting. It 
  was quite apparent that these demands were only a front. What the L.T.T.E. wanted 
  was a dominant role in the interim government with executive powers, together 
  with the exclusion of other militant groups. These motives came out crystal 
  clear when Thileepan died and India played up. The L.T.T.E. was given a dominant 
  role and was the only militant group chosen to represent the Tamils. The L.T.T.E. 
  proclaimed it as a great victory. These moves of the Indian government convinced 
  the L.T.T.E. that India would pander to its wishes in order to put the Accord 
  into practice. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>With this perception of their indispensability for the 
  success of the peace accord, and without an appreciation of even their own limitations 
  and the defensive position of the Tamil nation, the L.T.T.E.'s subsequent political 
  moves were totally estranged from reality. Their simplified thinking could not 
  take into account other factors such as the South, and the political existence 
  of the U.N.P. and J.R.. Nor could they allow for India's need to stabilize the 
  southern government and J.R.'s leadership, India's need to neutralise the propaganda 
  and politics against itself in the South, and last but not least, India's great-power 
  psychology. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>Reggie Siriwardene and Radhika Coomarasamy in their article 
  bring forward a point of view on the evolution of the movements that possess 
  such idealised doctrines: </span></p>
<p style='
text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>&quot;The mixture of idealism, a glorified sense of self 
  and history and the messianic aspects contained in ethnic and religious identification 
  is extremely conducive to fanaticism. Fanaticism has often been considered a 
  situation where even though an individual's perception of reality is greatly 
  at variance with the objective conditions, the emotional attachment to a set 
  of beliefs propels him forward. Each setback instead of forcing re-evaluation 
  of belief has an opposite effect and pushes the individual forward to martyrdom. 
  Fanatic movements then lose all capacity to compromise, accommodate other points 
  of view and refuse to adapt to changing conditions&quot;</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>This presents lucidly the contemporary history of the 
  Tigers. Thus it was not surprising that regardless of any future consequence, 
  they pushed India to the wall when they started butchering the Sinhalese civilians 
  in a fit of petulant anger. Therefore, in reality it was not only India's failure 
  as a guarantor, but also the L.T.T.E.'s failure as a leader that triggered off 
  the war in this way. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>The Tigers' history, their theoretical vacuum, lack of 
  political creativity, intolerance and fanatical dedication will be the ultimate 
  cause of their own break up. The legendary Tigers will go to their demise with 
  their legends smeared with the blood and tears of victims of their own misdoings. 
  A new Tiger will not emerge from their ashes. Only by breaking with this whole 
  history and its dominant ideology, can a new liberating outlook be born.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><b>6.3.5       Vortex of Violence: India's Catch 
  22</b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>The L.T.T.E. as an organisation may be disorganised and 
  broken up, but in small bands they can sustain a hit and run war for a long 
  time. The L.T.T.E. is able to sustain this not on the basis of support, but 
  by imposition of terror. Though India claims that normality has returned, the 
  war of attrition is continuing. Even after three months the L.T.T.E.'s small 
  units perform sporadic armed actions and the Indian army continues its reprisal 
  raids, round-ups and search operations and ad hoc curfews. Normality is an illusion. 
  This atmosphere of terror pervades even as the new year dawns. </span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Along with these two features surfaces another element 
  - with the L.T.T.E. on the defensive, other dissident groups have surfaced. 
  At present in the peninsula those who have come to the front, in alliance with 
  Indian army, are mainly from the P.L.O.T.E., the T.E.L.O., and the E.N.D.L.F.. 
  The disturbing fact is that most of the members who are here at present are 
  the remaining elements without an alternative. The dedicated members from the 
  P.L.O.T.E. and the T.E.L.O. have been eliminated in internal and inter-group 
  violence, torture and murder, or have run away in fear of their lives to far 
  corners of the world, as refugees or as disillusioned individuals. The elements 
  present here practise a politics of revenge - revenge against the L.T.T.E. for 
  the brutal annihilation of their movements and against the peninsula Tamils 
  whom they presume are supporters of the Tigers. These acts of revenge as well 
  as their function as informants to the Indian army, destroy all hope of any 
  leadership, evolving from these movements. The Eelam People's Revolutionary 
  Liberation Front (E.P.R.L.F.) has always claimed that its hands were not as 
  bloody as those of the other movements. But it has in recent times abandoned 
  all its avowed goals and thrown the people's interests to the winds and has 
  become a group of informants and proxy killers for the I.P.K.F.. Thus it seems 
  inevitable that the doctrine of eye for an eye will be practised to its fullest. 
  Though the Tigers are on the defensive, the killings by Tigers too have markedly 
  increased. On the eastern front we have to add the other forces, the Sri Lankan 
  S.T.F., and the Jihad, resulting in further instability. </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>In this scenario, India for its own interests tries and 
  will try to bring in stability by the use of its military might. This kind of 
  enforced equilibrium (a steady state) is not organic and will not be sustained, 
  because, internally, the dominant forces are inherently in conflict and the 
  stabilising forces are in reality weak. That is, the dominant forces of the 
  Sinhalese chauvinistic state, the J.V.P. and so on and the narrow nationalist 
  forces of the Tamils - the L.T.T.E. and other groups with basically the same 
  outlook on the national issue - are in conflict. The stabilising forces are 
  anti-racist left alliances and progressive nationalist movements. Thus the situation 
  will continue to erupt on and off, breaking any semblance of normality.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><b>6.3.6       The Peace Accord and Sinhalese Chauvinism</b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>The southern situation is deteriorating fast, and before 
  long, the island will be caught in a vortex of violence. The Peace Accord and 
  the Indian military presence have given added energies to the Sinhalese chauvinistic 
  forces. These populist forces have started rallying around the J.V.P.. The J.V.P. 
  is a group that had all along propagated a narrow nationalist ideology that 
  is anti-Tamil and anti-Indian. Its anti-Tamil sentiments are such that it does 
  not recognize the depth of oppression of the Tamils and thus advocates a “no 
  concession” position, apart from putting forward an abstract solution to the 
  Tamil problem, called “rights.” At present it is not rhetorically and violently 
  anti-Tamil for tactical reasons. But its abstract and meaningless solutions 
  and its theoretical documents show its anti-Tamil racism clearly. In recent 
  times it has successfully revived its armed action to keep in line with its 
  ideology. Its rhetoric is flamboyantly romantic and its actions are violent. 
  The J.V.P. talks about social issues as well as unemployment, deprivation, degeneration 
  of society and conditions of living. The analysis is in a simple framework and 
  the answers are simple such as “Women must bear children.. therefore a revolution 
  must occur”, and the solutions equally naive. However, many in the South feel 
  that the J.V.P. reflects the legitimate rights of the Sinhalese people and a 
  cross section of southern society is capitulating to this view. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>The J.V.P.'s real class base has been shown to arise 
  from the small producer. An analysis of the prevalent mode of production in 
  the Sinhalese rural areas shows that, in the agricultural base of the island 
  and the small peasant economy, there are numerous strata of proprietor class. 
  And this class is the main bearer of Sinhalese chauvinist ideology. Because 
  of the pre-capitalist nature of the rural economy, the rural proletariats have 
  assimilated the illusions of the petty producers. The urban-biased left parties 
  had long abandoned the rural proletarians to the bourgeois parties' political 
  control. This further reinforced chauvinist ideology amongst the rural population. 
  Now with increasing neocolonial penetration in the South, the rural proletariat 
  is facing a worsening economic situation. This class is therefore understandably 
  looking for alternative leadership. The J.V.P. provides the right blend of egalitarianism, 
  patriotism and chauvinism.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>Thus the chances of the U.N.P. continuing in a bourgeois 
  democratic framework, holding fair elections on a regular basis, are pretty 
  slim. On the other hand, Ronnie de Mel (the Finance Minister in the previous 
  government, who subsequently resigned from his post) argues the case for a rational 
  bourgeois solution. He warns against the military option, urges the party to 
  go to the electorate and explain to the people the Peace Accord, and gather 
  strength and isolate the J.V.P. and other chauvinistic elements inside and outside 
  the U.N.P.. Opposed to this option and to the pro-Peace Accord tendency is the 
  U.N.P.'s populist wing. The rational option serves the interests of a small 
  section, big business, entrepreneurs and other compradore sections. The populist 
  aspect is espoused by no less a personality than the President, then Prime Minister, 
  Mr.Premadasa. Therefore the U.N.P. is facing an internal power crisis as well. 
  </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><b><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>The President represents, and depends on, the chauvinists 
  for support and thus could only turn to the electorate and populist forces to 
  resolve the internal power struggle. Therefore he is directly appealing to the 
  ordinary masses with his grand grass roots programmes tainted with anti-Indian 
  populist politics. Ultimately this may lead him to alliances with other chauvinistic 
  forces outside the broad front. Such alliances, will have far reaching consequences 
  for the U.N.P. as a parliamentary party.</span></b><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'> </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>       Brute force and repressive 
  legislation are likely to be used to smash all opposition. A sign of the developing 
  sinister tendencies is the paramilitary training of the U.N.P.'s rank and file, 
  forming units referred to as the “Green Tigers”. These units are coming to resemble 
  the death squads of the Marcos regime. Against this background the Sri Lankan 
  military aspirations and their relation to Indian interests also play a part 
  in determining future developments.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>Though the evolution of political 
  forces in the two nations look mutually exclusive, the whole process is inter-linked. 
  The J.V.P. and the L.T.T.E. are groups which, although having developed in different 
  backgrounds, profess similar ideologies, and have a common framework and parallel 
  social bases in the two ethnic groups. They share an intolerance of other opinions 
  and other groups, and they both indulge in brutal murders and torture of their 
  own dissidents and of members of rival groups. Many who give their overt or 
  tacit support to the J.V.P., try to forget these aspects. It will grow into 
  demonic proportions when the movement grows larger - a historical phenomenon 
  parallel to that of the L.T.T.E.. As the Tamil community was to learn bitterly, 
  when the necessary checks are not made and questions are not asked in the formative 
  days, the people would later have no control. Massacres went on for days and 
  our history was stained with the blood of our own people when the L.T.T.E. turned 
  its guns on the T.E.L.O., the E.P.R.L.F., the P.L.O.T.E. and ordinary civilians; 
  when the T.E.L.O. turned its violence on dissidents and ordinary civilians, 
  or when the P.L.O.T.E. tortured and murdered its own dissidents. Similarly in 
  the South, this brutal tendency will add to the U.N.P.'s state violence for 
  sectarian and private ends.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>Furthermore, it should be realised that it would be incorrect 
  to believe that by the espousal of narrow nationalism, India's dominance would 
  be contained, or conversely that Indian penetration would contain the violent 
  rise of Sinhalese chauvinism. Both are interlocking phenomena. The J.V.P.'s 
  simplistic “India bashing” does not take into account, the geopolitical reality, 
  India's aspirations, and as a militant Sinhalese nationalist group with a chauvinistic 
  ideology, its own geographic constraints. This might provide a basis for further 
  entrenchment of India in the Tamil area and increasing domination of the North 
  and East, and later also of the South. And on the other hand, increasing India's 
  role in Sri Lanka's internal political life would give further impetus to narrow 
  nationalist movements in the South. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'>A good example is found in the current situation 
  in Trincomalee. The Indian military presence in Trincomalee removed the patronage 
  of the Sri Lankan security forces and the state machinery given to the Sinhalese. 
  When the patronage was removed, the Sinhalese, feeling vulnerable and fearful, 
  fled to refugee camps. The indigenous Tamils retaliated for the years of terror 
  at the hands of the Sinhalese. Therefore the Sinhalese refugees fear to resume 
  their earlier life pattern. The Sri Lankan security forces who were the patrons 
  of Sinhalese violence in the Trincomalee district have voiced their frustration 
  to foreign journalists; and Sinhalese refugees are even more rabidly anti-Tamil 
  and anti-Indian, making them fertile ground for fresh J.V.P. recruitment. On 
  the other hand the I.P.K.F. seems to be the only guarantor of the Tamil people's 
  safety in Trincomalee. The Indian military has also successfully marginalised 
  other Tamil militant movements, making the Tamil people totally dependent on 
  Indian authority. Against this backdrop, the Indian army is seen to move heavy 
  armour to the China bay area, entrenching its defence position.           </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>Therefore in this complex interaction of forces India's 
  role, though it seems to be external, is totally interlocked. Western foreign 
  policy writers have tended to view the Indian role in terms of regional crisis 
  management. India appears to have gained a foot-hold into the territory and 
  politics of its southern neighbour in a role formally approved by the West and 
  the Soviet Union as peace keepers and crisis managers. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>But India has enmeshed itself in a difficult situation 
  here. Its most important objectives cannot be achieved without what seems to 
  be the most elusive phenomenon - stability. India needs stability for its gains 
  in defence and economy. Furthermore it is the essential justification for being 
  on this island. Ideally, India would like stability with preservation of the 
  unitary state structure in Sri Lanka, and the realisation of the legitimate 
  rights of Tamils with India as guarantor.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>However, in the North and the East, the L.T.T.E. is going 
  to last a long time. The operation to disarm the Tigers caused much civilian 
  damage in both life and property. Inter-group rivalry and senseless murders 
  are a regular occurrence. The local population is terrorised, living in a political 
  vacuum. Despite pledges the U.N.P. will not be able to bring off easily measures 
  to alleviate the Tamil nation's problems, without endangering its political 
  existence. Thus, India might have to back-track on many issues regarding the 
  Tamils, or try strong arm tactics. Either way it will spur the growth of narrow 
  nationalism and anti-Indian bitterness amongst both Sinhalese and Tamils.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>Thus India will not be able to solve the conflict. It 
  has not only triggered off volatile and destructive tendencies which have lain 
  dormant, but also has this time managed to get enmeshed in them. India may not 
  gain a reputation as model arbitrator from the International community, but 
  may rather be tolerated as an immature regional power as are most big powers 
  of this world.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><b>6.4       A note on Economic Factors in the</b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><b>Regional Crisis</b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'>For persons with an intellectual bent, the situation 
  in Sri Lanka provides an interesting case study in terms of the interaction 
  between politics and economy. The Sri Lankan ruling class, since independence, 
  through various state structures and processes, have attempted to consolidate 
  power. While making the changes from a British type parliamentary system to 
  the creation of the executive presidency, and from welfare state, centralised 
  state capitalism to a fully open economy, the different factions of the ruling 
  class attempted to consolidate power and accumulate wealth. In the developed 
  capitalist countries, the various forms of parliamentary democracy negotiate 
  power for the ruling elite and create a sense of complacency among other classes, 
  thereby ensuring the stability of the system. Being on the periphery of the 
  world capitalist system,  dealing with fluctuating markets for what are often 
  cash-crops, and having low industrial development and stagnant rural agricultural 
  sectors, parliamentary democracy has resulted in a less stable mode of entrenching 
  the system to the sole benefit of the ruling class. The ruling class' super-exploitation 
  could not be offset by affluence acquired through colonialism or neocolonialism, 
  as was possible in the developed nations. This exploitation is naked and the 
  masses of people in its home base are deprived. Within this context,  the need 
  to hold on to power through parliamentary democracy in a situation of meagre 
  resources,  has led the ruling class to adopt from Western economic theorists 
  such concepts as &quot;trickle-down&quot; development. The satisfaction of the 
  electoral power base is obtained by sidestepping real issues dealing with the 
  economy, and crusading on secondary issues that have emotional content. Thus, 
  in Sri Lanka, electoral victory and control of the state apparatus was obtained 
  only through the satiation of the aspirations of the majority community. These 
  aspirations arose from a belief that their ills were fundamentally to do with 
  minorities, race, language and religion. Such campaign issues always required 
  the formation of alliances with the petit bourgeoisie. Since the ideology of 
  the petit bourgeois small-producer dominated the widespread rural areas of the 
  Sinhalese South, this class played a pivotal role in the parliament. As shown 
  earlier, the triumph of the narrow nationalist ideology, whether in the context 
  of a fully fledged open economy or in a protective nationalist state capitalism, 
  was eminently evident.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>       This sort of dependent economies 
  lack the buffer to absorb the shocks of internal subversion. From the early 
  days, armed conflicts, whether the 1971 J.V.P. insurrection, or the current 
  J.V.P. subversion, brought about disarray in the political situation and a downward 
  plunge for the economy. This phenomenon is more or less due to the economic 
  instability of the dependent capitalist system and its paradoxical dependence 
  on narrow nationalist ideologies. Thus, although the U.N.P. was committed to 
  the market economy in toto, it could never sell itself as a paradise for multinational 
  investment. Its free-trade zones never took off and no large scale investment 
  took place, making Colombo a failed &quot;paradise city,&quot; and tourism soon 
  felt the ill effects. After a decade of self-destructive civil war, the ruling 
  party tried to listen to its capitalist sensibilities and neutralise ethnic 
  tensions. This resulted in a backlash of petit bourgeois nationalism in the 
  South and a revival, with new vigour, of the J.V.P..</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'>In a bid to stave off the violent situation created 
  by the militancy, and to ensure political and economic stability, the ruling 
  party replaced the faction within itself that was committed to a capitalist 
  programme with the faction that is populist and narrow nationalist. That is, 
  the  Premadasa faction, with its grand grass-roots programmes, replaced the 
  more Westward looking Jayewardene faction. However,despite these many political 
  manipulations and machinations, the changes in the legislature and the state 
  structure, have not provided the local ruling classes with their political or 
  economic stability. Thus, the economic vagaries of the dependent capitalist 
  state, its lack of ability in offsetting internal dissent, and the precarious 
  nature of its economy, together undermine and frustrate the political consolidation 
  of its ruling classes. As such, the Sri Lankan bourgeoisie are unable to provide 
  a solution to the present crisis and are in a state of disarray. Moreover, the 
  situation reflects the economic and  political realities of pushing an open 
  economic programme and unleashing market forces in the peripheries of the world 
  capitalist system.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>Again it is the neocolonial situation with its economic 
  and geopolitical realities, that would prove to be the important challenge to 
  the J.V.P.'s narrow political vision. It is fairly obvious from the activities 
  of the J.V.P. that it aspires to capture state power. Its present simplistic 
  slogans and bravado against Indian hegemony and its political and economic programmes, 
  which do not account for the realities of a country locked in the mesh of the 
  world capitalist system, will be exposed if the J.V.P. ever assumes power. It 
  would have to either collapse or compromise. And then the true nature of its 
  petit bourgeoisie class interests would be exposed.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'>Thus, again, we seem to arrive at a historical 
  dead end. The bourgeoisie, of whatever race or faction, cannot hold power without 
  an effective alliance with the petit bourgeoisie. The petit bourgeoisie, although 
  overtly seeming to be progressive in their resistance to domination and neo-colonialism, 
  given the nature of their class base, have always compromised or taken a path 
  of adventurous self-destruction. While the bourgeoisie brought about various 
  degrees of neocolonialist penetration, thereby bleeding the people, the petit 
  bourgeois ideology of narrow nationalism, drawing on a brutal culture of violence, 
  cripples the people's moral strength and weakens organised resistance against 
  oppression. Furthermore, the political tunnel vision of the petit bourgeoisie 
  is leading the country into abortive episodes that seem to pave the way for 
  more domination, more  deprivation, and tragedy. </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>One can see that although the self-image and ambitions 
  of the Indian ruling class are great, and India's need to assert its dominance 
  in the region has been fashioned out meticulously, its economic and political 
  situation as a dependent capitalist country at the vagaries of the world capitalist 
  system makes its involvement in a war of attrition both detrimental to the ruling 
  class' power perception and debilitating to its economy. Nevertheless, its wars 
  are beneficial to its expanding defence industry and to the ruling class which 
  controls power. It is also an avenue for sharpening the oppressive machinery 
  of the military, and the C.R.P.F., making them more efficient in quelling internal 
  subversion. Thus there might be short term gains for its ruling class, although 
  in the long run, due to its dependence and uneven development, that it will 
  be able to absorb the shocks of prolonged conflict is doubtful. The enormous 
  loss would be to the millions of India's oppressed and poor, for whom this brings 
  more dangers and deprivation and has no meaning.<u> <a href="#_ftnref1">[Top]</a></u></span></p>
