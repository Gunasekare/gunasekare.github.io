<h3>9.1 A Reflection on Events: Mid-1989</h3>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>We have now been living under the long shadow of the gun for more than a decade 
  and a half, holding hope against hope for the survival of our children who are 
  dominated by violence from all directions without a purpose or meaning. But, 
  on the other hand, we also note the glazed faces of people accepting it all 
  with a sense of resignation. Under these circumstances, to be objective or analytical 
  seems to be a major effort, like trying to do something physical in the midst 
  of a debilitating illness. Whenever we write we are dogged by this reality, 
  fearing our losing the thread of sanity and the community submerging without 
  resistance into this slime of terror and violence. The community is bereft of 
  all its human potential. Every &quot;sane&quot; person is fleeing this burning 
  country - its hospitals have no doctors, its universities no teachers, its crumbled 
  war-torn buildings cannot be rebuilt because there are no engineers or masons 
  or even a labour force, its families are headed by women, and the old, the sick, 
  and the weary die without even the family to mourn or sons to bury the dead. 
  If our earlier account had appeared to be &quot;plugging a line,&quot; as some 
  would want to put it, it was because it was important for us to arrive at a 
  synthesis in analysis, seek an understanding, find spaces to organise, and revitalise 
  a community that was sinking into a state of resignation. Objectivity was not 
  solely an academic exercise for us. Objectivity, the pursuit of truth and the 
  propagation of critical and honest positions, was crucial for the community. 
  But they could also cost many of us our lives. Any involvement with them was 
  undertaken only as a survival task. One day we sat down to discuss a postscript 
  to our account. As an exercise we started laying out the complex forces in interaction. 
  After the exercise, one of us wrote in bold letters - A TRAGIC MESS.<br>
  However, certain trends set in motion, as shown in our analysis two years ago, 
  seem to continue to hold the recent years in sway. That does not mean that things 
  have been static or that the scenario was politically dormant. Contrarily, a 
  great many things have occurred in the intervening two years. Three elections, 
  proclaimed as democratic, took place - for the Provincial Council of the North 
  and East in November 1988, the Presidency in December 1988,and the Parliament 
  in February 1989. Within the reigning party the earlier power bloc has been 
  marginalised. The head of state has changed - President Jayewardene, the blue-blooded 
  representative of the Sri Lankan bourgeoisie, was replaced by Premadasa, a populist 
  up-climber. And many acts of parliament have been passed. Paradoxically, within 
  this seemingly overt democratic activity, the situation has deteriorated. The 
  morbidity of the political situation has increased. The political situation 
  in the south of the island has deteriorated so much that the brutal culture 
  of violence is analogous to, as one of the southern activists mused, a synthesis 
  of fascism with Asiatic despotism. An amorphous spectre of terror and violence 
  seems to pervade the entire island. No one can be complacent or aloof.<br>
  The government of Sri Lanka is unstable, and the civilian structures are tied 
  up in knots and paralysed in the entire island. Human rights violations have 
  increased beyond count. Terror by the state and every other force seems permanent, 
  ever becoming part and parcel of our daily life. The Indian Peace-Keeping Force 
  on the other hand is causing more violence, and instability. </p>
<h3>Democracy and Illusions</h3>
<p>Moreover, every democratic flurry, such as the elections, has been considered 
  a watershed, especially by the propaganda machinery; while journalists from 
  the West and from India speculate on changes that could emanate from these events. 
  For us, it has been much ado about nothing because, within all this furious 
  democratic activity (such as frequent negotiations, changing slogans, India's 
  attempt to demonstrate the setting up of structures for political organisation 
  and power sharing, and Sri Lanka's attempt to be seen in control) the reality 
  is that the people are increasingly marginalised and none of the forces is accountable 
  to them.<br>
  Many have wondered at the apparent lack of enthusiasm on the part of the population 
  to the attempts at democracy. It is ironic that a country which had one of the 
  best records for its reliance on the parliamentary democratic system, sank into 
  sullen silence and refused to vote. Why did the Northern Tamil population reject 
  the Provincial Councils which were portrayed as a mode of organising structures 
  for political negotiation and power sharing ? Then again, when an act of parliament 
  (under pressure from India) ensured a merged North and East Provincial Council, 
  the closest to a traditional Tamil homeland, why did the people keep their distance? 
  India would want us to believe that it is entirely due to the terror campaign 
  carried out by the Tigers, the L.T.T.E., for a total boycott of the electoral 
  process. Be that as it may, the Tiger campaign did have its weight. It is however 
  the disillusionment of the people over the entire array of political forces, 
  and the meaninglessness of the vote, that prevented them from even entertaining 
  the idea of risking their lives. Every political proposal came at the point 
  of a gun, both for and against the vote. The Provincial Council elections were 
  seen to bring in rulers rather than representatives of the people. (See Appendix 
  IV, which reproduces &quot;Laying aside Illusions&quot;, a document signed by 
  50 university teachers in reply to Indian High Commissioner to Colombo, J.N.Dixit's 
  talk in Jaffna)<br>
  Democracy was illusory, especially in the North, because of the human rights 
  violations perpetrated by India and its collaborators. Blatant killings of civilians 
  and so-called Tiger supporters went unexplained. Mass torture was common place, 
  such as when, virtually the entire male population of a village was hung upside 
  down and water was poured through their noses or when the women in a commuter 
  van were made to walk round the vehicle on their knees. Torture was routinely 
  meted out to all those detained, and one could not elicit some reasonable response 
  from the authorities by complaining about it. Veiled threats and intimidation 
  were the order of the day. If one talked too much, one could be intimidated, 
  killed or have his shop or house blown up. If one wrote about some event (which 
  is what the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Jaffna did after the killing 
  of 2 students in a peaceful demonstration) one would only receive a curt dismissal. 
  This emphasized the contempt of the Indian machinery - its Peace Keeping Force 
  and its diplomatic corps.<br>
  Finally, no one seemed to be convinced that the Sri Lankan state would or could 
  devolve power in a situation where the Sinhalese chauvinists had the upper hand. 
  This was subsequently made very plain by the Chief Minister of the merged North-East 
  Province, who continually complained that the Sri Lankan state was not devolving 
  any real economic or political power to the Provincial Council.</p>
<h3>India's Quagmire</h3>
<p>Any attempt to seek stability and peace from a politically insensitive great 
  power will, inevitably, have a precipitating effect on the crisis. When India's 
  attempts to bring the Tigers back under its patronage failed, it attempted to 
  groom other local political forces for the exercise of its patronage. India 
  tried genuinely to portray to the world at large that there was an indigenous 
  facet to its control, by arming and training the E.P.R.L.F. and a mixed bag 
  of other militant groups, as the executors of its military power. However, the 
  main military opposition, the Tigers, survived for more than two years in the 
  jungles of the North and retained the potential to wage a hit and run war in 
  the urban centres. Thus they were able very effectively to lock the Indian military 
  and its local collaborators in a demoralising war of attrition. India is unable 
  to scale down the level of conflict, or to reduce the tempo of human rights 
  violations carried out by its troops in frustrated reprisal raids. As such, 
  it continues to alienate further the community it had ostensibly come to help. 
  <br>
  As for its attempt at creating a local political face, neither the T.U.L.F. 
  nor the E.P.R.L.F. whom it groomed as alternatives for political leadership, 
  took off. In the East where a greater need was felt for the I.P.K.F.'s role 
  and where the pro-Indian groups had a more stable position, the I.P.K.F. failed 
  to bring peace and stability. The T.U.L.F. faired miserably in the parliamentary 
  elections. The role of the pro-Indian groups in the violence directed against 
  Muslims in the East, particularly in Samanthurai during May, further discredited 
  the I.P.K.F.. Furthermore, these incidents provided concrete grounds for the 
  fears of the Muslim minority for their survival as a community in a Tamil-dominated 
  polity. Thus the Muslim Congress (a Muslim party propagating the ideology of 
  Muslim nationalism) became extremely popular among the Muslims and gave political 
  life to the cleavages between the Muslims and Tamils.</p>
<h3>The Tigers and other Tamil militants</h3>
<p>In these last two years, the Tigers still remain the chief protagonists on 
  the Tamil political scene. Their war of attrition in the Tamil areas had the 
  world's fourth largest army tied down in a demoralising situation. The brutal 
  reprisals and ruthless murders carried out by the Indian army and its local 
  collaborators increased the bitterness and anguish of the community, thus providing 
  a continual source of recruitment to the Tiger ranks. Furthermore, although 
  the people generally were disgruntled and disillusioned with the Tigers' strategies 
  (which were resulting in continual loss of life and disruption of day to day 
  existence), the Tigers were still largely dentified as defenders of the Tamil 
  cause. However, it is equally true that they would have wanted the Tigers to 
  opt for a more pragmatic stance towards the I.P.K.F., and would have been satisfied 
  to see the Tigers as the leaders of the newly-formed Provincial Council of the 
  merged Northern and Eastern Provinces. Although the Tigers' tactics imposed 
  a terrorised silence on the people, there was still a tacit understanding and 
  a hopeful commitment from sections of the community to the Tigers. The other 
  groups, including the E.P.R.L.F., misread the signs in their political blindness, 
  and, in the post peace-accord period, changed their tactics to imitate the Tigers 
  and practised terror and murder against the local populace. But the Tigers had 
  based their support, much more than on terror, on the ideology of narrow nationalism 
  and the aspirations of the middle class, to whom the Tigers' obsessive dedication 
  carried much appeal and respect.<br>
  The reality of the Tigers' power base was further exemplified in February 1989 
  by the good showing of the E.R.O.S. in the parliamentary elections. The E.R.O.S. 
  had been in collusion with the Tigers, who allowed the E.R.O.S. to participate 
  in the elections even though death threats were issued by the Tigers against 
  all participants. Tragically, this threat was carried out when the Tigers murdered 
  Annamalai, a long-standing member of the N.S.S.P. and an active member of the 
  M.I.R.J.E..He had lived in Jaffna and identified with its people and their sufferings 
  during its darkest decade.The N.S.S.P. had long opposed the Sri Lankan state's 
  Tamil policy and had campaigned in the South for self determination for the 
  Tamils.<br>
  It would be wrong to underestimate the Tigers' strength as much as the strength 
  of the narrow nationalist ideology among the Tamils - especially among the northern 
  Tamils. However, a count down has begun for Tiger dominance. The tide was not 
  always on their side. Be that as it may, some signs bode ill for them. Prolonged 
  life in the jungles in difficult conditions, and the wiping out of their support 
  structures in the villages by the I.P.K.F. and its collaborators, are all taking 
  their toll on the morale of their cadre. The death of many of their experienced 
  men in the October 1987 war and subsequent armed actions sapped the knowledge, 
  expertise and spirit of the movement. And although there is a continual flow 
  of new recruits, they are of a different generation. As one of us wrote, the 
  age of the child warrior had begun. It is the greatest tragedy for this nation 
  and the Tiger movement that mere children, without any ability to coherently 
  think or undertake politico-military activity, carried the most lethal weaponry, 
  as they wandered around with blazing hatred in their heart and were hunted.<br>
  Though the Tigers were challenging the Indian army and mobilising to subvert 
  Indian hegemony, their tactics and strategies, both politically and militarily, 
  were visibly stultifying the community's organised resistance. Militarily, the 
  landmine war in the crowded urban settlements paid the price in civilian losses, 
  further undermining the total commitment of their support base. The campaign 
  to boycott civil structures that the Tigers pursued following the October 1987 
  war, was seen by the community to be destructive and meaningless, and was obeyed 
  only out of fear. The community as a whole, watched in disbelief as some senior 
  civil servants were arbitrarily gunned down for keeping the civilian machinery 
  running. The continual disruptions brought about by these boycott activities 
  and hardships imposed on the ordinary people, also helped to lay the foundation 
  for an unwilling cooperation of the local populace with the Tigers. Furthermore, 
  the Tigers' recent moves of negotiating with the Sri Lankan state mystified 
  the community and brought a creeping sense of suspicion of the glorified image 
  of the Tigers as a fearless movement, dedicated to the cause of the separate 
  homeland - Tamil Eelam.<br>
  Thus,it would not be far from reality to see cracks in the fanatical ideology 
  of the Tiger movement. Many wonder why the Tigers made overtures to the Sri 
  Lankan state. Is it because there was erosion of their morale? Is it a new pragmatism 
  in Tiger thinking ? Is it their desire to survive with trappings of political 
  and military power as the leaders of the Tamils, even in a powerless provincial 
  council ? Or is it because there was pressure from greater powers which want 
  a neutralisation of the Indian presence and see it happening only through the 
  Sri Lankan government's coming to an agreement with the principal protagonists 
  on the Tamil scene? The answer is really a condensation of all these reasons. 
  The Tigers primarily wanted to wield power as the only force. It is the only 
  factor that explains many of their past actions. Many in the North knew that, 
  in mid-1988, emissaries of a rather low key nature from the Tamil Eelam lobby 
  of the U.S.A. visited the jungle hide-out of the Tiger leader Prabakaran with 
  a request to scale down the war, adopt a conciliatory stance with the Sri Lankan 
  state and to arrive at a means of getting rid of India and coming back to power. 
  At the time it was known that the attempt ended failure. But could such a message 
  be more relevant to the Tigers after a fairly demoralising year?<br>
  Thus after a decade of national liberation struggle and a ruthless striving 
  for leadership that caused enormous loss of life and the denudation of the people's 
  moral strength, the Tigers seem to be at a dead end. Their pursuance of a supremacist 
  struggle at the cost of the very concept of liberation and their moulding of 
  the spirit of their cadre on a fanatical dedication to the Leader and the Movement, 
  was to be their undoing, as it is within all such narrow nationalist, fascist 
  movements. Thus we as a people are also having a countdown. We can wait years. 
  For a people, history does not change overnight.<br>
  In the case of the pro-Indian groups, their lack of political sensitiveness 
  jeopardised their more stable position in the East. It was shown in the way 
  they handled the question of the multi- ethnic tensions of the East. They exploited 
  the prejudices of the Tamil community against the Muslims for the sake of quick 
  popularity. They also gave way to the sentiments of revenge against the Sinhalese 
  settlers, thus fanning suspicion, fear, anger and communal violence. These episodes 
  complicated and marred their attempt to portray themselves as legitimate representatives 
  of the people, at least in the East. It is indeed tragic, as the E.P.R.L.F. 
  had been the least communal of the Tamil militant groups in the past. As pointed 
  out in our earlier essays, the E.P.R.L.F.'s fundamental weaknesses stemmed from 
  their superficial theory and practice, a lack of creative political thinking, 
  and a loose party structure. These aspects, together with considerations of 
  security, allowed no other path of progress than that of existing as puppets 
  of India, and, for all the revolutionary rhetoric, to be dominated by narrow 
  nationalism and opportunism. In the North, where the E.P.R.L.F. had less acceptability, 
  it further alienated the people by its brutal conduct.</p>
<h3>The southern situation</h3>
<p>In the South, the last three years have seen the release of a cascade of the 
  dammed up effects of twenty years of chauvinism and a decade of the patriotic 
  war. All the heightened passions and the political expediencies adopted by the 
  Sinhalese ruling class to stay in power, seem to have arrived at a logical conclusion. 
  The marauding terror gangs of the S.T.F. and assorted death squads, which come 
  in many colours (&quot;Green Tigers&quot;, &quot;Black Cats&quot; and so forth.) 
  left their death trail in the deep South. In the past, terror was conducted 
  against a marginalised minority who were peripheral to Sri Lanka's parliamentary 
  politics. Today it has come to the heart of the political process and the core 
  of Sri Lanka's economic base.<br>
  The J.V.P. had on the other hand polished to perfection the tactics of terror 
  chosen by Tamil liberation organisations like the Tigers. Work stoppages and 
  civil disobedience campaigns are conducted through the issue of intimidatory 
  letters and threats of death and there does not seem to be even a pretence at 
  mass mobilisation. However, the recent spate of strikes where the J.V.P. was 
  the motivating force, also put the legitimate claims of wages for the workers 
  as one of its demands. Nonetheless, it is the J.V.P.'s death threats that seem 
  to be the most effective. Death penalties are always carried out in a gruesome 
  manner, and the sadistic, primordial nature of these killings have no analogy 
  in contemporary history. Even after killing someone, the J.V.P. do not let go; 
  they lay down instructions on how the deceased should be interred. For example, 
  the family may be instructed to drag the body to the burial grounds, and, if 
  they disobey, the next day they would find the corpse propped up against their 
  door. The J.V.P.'s targets are the supporters of the ruling party, government 
  officials, and anti-racist forces, mainly of the Left. The J.V.P.'s terror is 
  matched by the terror of the state. Thus the numbers of those slaughtered run 
  into thousands. In a number of killings of ordinary persons and opposition activists, 
  doubts remain in the peoples' minds as to who was really responsible. Indeed, 
  they do not know whom to fear more. On 29 July 1989, government forces killed 
  over 100 Sinhalese civilians, who were forced onto the streets at gun point 
  by the J.V.P., to demonstrate against the Indian presence. A curfew was then 
  in force.The Minister for Defence, speaking to the Sunday Times subsequently, 
  suggested that people should fear the guns of the state more than they feared 
  J.V.P. guns. Thus a once peaceful community has become one bristling with lethal 
  weaponry. A culture of violence is the nurturing ground for the future generations 
  of this beautiful and fertile island, where we, in our childhood and youth, 
  laughed and played among the tall grass and sand dunes.<br>
  Our previous essays chronicled the dialectical evolution of the ascendency of 
  narrow nationalist ideology and the over emphasis of the ethnic factor, along 
  with the inadequacy and failure of the Left. The Left in the North had been 
  a small force and was historically submerged by the rise of nationalism. The 
  position of the southern Left worsened after they abdicated their responsibility 
  for solving the national question to the Indian state. Their unequivocal,and 
  perhaps well intended, support for the Peace Accord was used by the J.V.P. to 
  jeopardise their very survival. But worse still, their silence concerning Indian 
  human rights violations during and after the October war, made them vulnerable 
  to criticism from all sides.<br>
  The campaign of decimation carried out by the J.V.P. seems to be most viciously 
  executed against the Left. The tragic loss to the future of this country is 
  heightened by killings, such as that of the charismatic and humane leader of 
  the Left alliance, Vijaya Kumaranatunga. The Left's long standing advocates, 
  including the leading trade unionist L.W.Panditha (who was the convenor of 21 
  trade unions) have been slaughtered. Poignant are the stories such as that of 
  the school master George Ratnayake, a long-standing member of the communist 
  party in a remote village in the deep South. This village had always voted &quot;red,&quot; 
  not because they were communists, but because of their &quot;School Master.&quot; 
  This simple and dedicated man was shot down in broad daylight on the main street 
  in his village, as he disembarked from a bus. His beloved village sat in stupefied 
  silence</p>
<h3>The Future</h3>
<p>Within this tragic history there is still an attempt by concerned people to 
  think coherently of the future. There are debates going on as to the correct 
  path for survival, organisation and possible break-throughs. There is, especially 
  in the North, a limited attempt at organising at the grass-roots level, so as 
  to handle the repressive situation and violence from all sides. These are very 
  small beginnings indeed. In the South, staying alive seems to be still the dominant 
  issue, and activists as individuals and groups are attempting to handle questions 
  of the realities around them. At present, the odds are stacked against these 
  initiatives in both communities. The present belongs to the forces of reaction. 
  What is the future for this beleaguered land?<br>
  India has been extending its regional influence, both through diplomatic channels 
  (such as the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation) and military 
  and economic actions such as its intervention in the Maldives and economic blockade 
  of Nepal. Its involvement in Sri Lanka, as we have shown, has been problematic, 
  bringing no quick solution and, instead, giving growth to discontent at home 
  and disenchantment abroad. Thus it will have to either withdraw or prove that 
  it is achieving its originally stated aim of bringing an end to the conflict 
  in Sri Lanka.<br>
  Given the option of Indian withdrawal,will that in itself solve the entire problem, 
  as chorused in agreement by the U.N.P., the J.V.P. and the Tigers? It is clear 
  that the Indian withdrawal may be conditional upon an effective transfer of 
  power in the North and East to the Tamils. Yet, such devolution will be vehemently 
  attacked by the J.V.P. which has consistently opposed provincial councils and 
  the merger of the Northern and Eastern Provinces. For the Tigers, Indian withdrawal 
  would be portrayed as a military victory. But they would also want to maintain 
  the apparatus of the merged Provincial Council, with themselves in control of 
  it, a position that would enrage the J.V.P. and its support base. The question 
  of the Indian withdrawal requires a clear analysis of the complex political 
  forces contending for control throughout Sri Lanka. For the people, any solution 
  to the brutal and intense violence has to come from within the communities and 
  cannot be imposed from outside. The development of these internal structures 
  is a long and arduous task, a process which is only just beginning to be comprehended 
  1 .</p>
<h3>9.2 An Addendum - February 1990 </h3>
<p>Although much has happened on the surface in recent months, one hesitates to 
  write more for the reason that it would be improper to touch on aspects of an 
  unfinished story without giving a thorough-going analysis. Such would properly 
  be material for a separate book. <br>
  Some of the developments have reached such poignant proportions that if Tamils 
  as a community and Ceylonese as a nation continue to ignore them, our future 
  would indeed be without hope. We shall merely highlight some of these developments. 
  With the I.P.K.F. having withdrawn to small enclaves in Jaffna and Trincomalee 
  with its allies, Tamil nationalist politics as represented by the L.T.T.E. may 
  appear to be in a strong position. This line has been pushed by a vocal section 
  of the Tamil expatriate lobby, as well as for reasons of local politics in Tamil 
  Nadu. Speeches and special songs by publicists in Tamil Nadu are enjoying wide 
  circulation on tape. One need not probe far to detect something forced and superficial 
  about this euphoria. Behind the flags, bunting, speeches and songs, the Tigers 
  are deeply anxious, if not disturbed. Their methods and ideology have taken 
  their toll. Every new crisis brought fresh doubts, resulting in many senior 
  men leaving the movement. A significant aspect of the widespread disillusionment 
  with the liberation struggle is that the L.T.T.E.'s new recruits are largely 
  children in their very early teens - known as child warriors or Cow&amp;Gate 
  warriors - and mainly from the more deprived sections of the community. In contrast 
  to the early days of the militancy, there are hardly any recruits from high 
  school and above. The older boys may form links with the L.T.T.E. for pragmatic 
  reasons, and may do some publicity work for them. This helps to bring in child 
  recruits. But they would carefully avoid any commitment to fight for the L.T.T.E..<br>
  There is then the question of how committed the society is to the form of liberation 
  envisioned by the dominant politics. The people appear to be resigned to accepting 
  permanent conflict as being an inherent attribute of the dominant politics. 
  In Jaffna, where social mobility has been considerably increased by large scale 
  emigration to the West since July 1983, the average mature adult and university 
  leaver, looks to emigration as the desired goal. Some sources put the number 
  of emigrants from Jaffna at 200,000, or 25% of the population of Jaffna in 1983. 
  For reasons of its own insecurity, this emigre class tends to encourage, and 
  become locked into the politics of extremism and destruction at home. This has 
  been discussed elsewhere [See Reports of the University Teachers for Human Rights(Jaffna)].<br>
  The militancy did little to remove the discomfort felt by Eastern Province Tamils 
  against the Jaffna dominated politics.Some of the abler and politically sensitive 
  leaders the L.T.T.E. from the Eastern Province, had faced difficult times with 
  the hierarchy. In trying to force a Tamil identity on the Muslims of the North-East, 
  the Tamils are flying in the face of their own historical experience at the 
  hands of the Sinhalese dominated state. The Tigers, while enjoying a spell of 
  unchallenged power, can hardly be unaware of these factors. Their attitudes 
  to the recruitment of children reflect a sense of despondency. In the early 
  days of the militancy, when mature recruits came in large numbers, the ideals 
  of freedom were much talked about. The reasons talked about today have a fatalistic 
  ring. When parents approach L.T.T.E. leaders to ask for their children who had 
  left home and &quot;volunteered,&quot; they are frequently reminded by the leaders 
  that they too are missed by their parents. Little is said about any great cause.<br>
  It is hardly surprising that the propaganda thrust of the struggle must hinge 
  around the two words &quot;Traitor&quot; and &quot;Martyr.&quot; Indeed, the 
  hundreds who ultimately made sacrifices for the same cause and were killed abjectly 
  as traitors, speak not just for the enormous wasted potential, but also for 
  the widespread frustration and anger that lie simmering below the surface. With 
  room for democratic activity largely non-existent, it is easy to underestimate 
  grossly this anger and the resulting insecurity for Tiger aspirations. This 
  is reflected in the increasing obsession with &quot;traitors.&quot;<br>
  In contrast to its treatment of dissidents who were fellow Tamils, it has been 
  possible for the Tigers to sit at the same table and exchange pleasantries with 
  the unrepentant traditional adversary-the Sinhalese state. Even public praise 
  and expressions of confidence have been lavished on the latter. Once again there 
  is a dangerous moral insensitivity on the part of the Tamils to what this state 
  represents - as is evident from the terrible fate of the thousands of Sinhalese 
  young, at the hands of the state.<br>
  What has won widespread admiration is the destructive aspect of the Tigers. 
  Their methods ensured that no one else was allowed to do anything, good or bad. 
  Lacking the ability to face up to the Tigers, all other parties were driven 
  by their weaknesses to show themselves in such a bad light, that the Tigers 
  were welcomed back with widespread relief and their legitimacy was enhanced. 
  However, recent events in the East have shown that, when challenged, the Tigers 
  too could behave towards civilians in harsh military fashion. Many consciously 
  acknowledge a negative reason for accepting the Tigers - that without them, 
  they would be fighting once more. Again, one must not lose sight of the fact 
  that the remarkable success of the Tigers and their fatal weaknesses are reflections 
  of Jaffna society itself.<br>
  Apart from the failure of the society to take a stand or question the massive 
  destruction of life and energies through internal developments, yet another 
  factor most vividly reflects its fatal politics and its destructive value system. 
  It is its failure even to see what is being done to its own children who are 
  being cajoled and cornered into carrying arms, with no idea of what they are 
  doing. All armed parties are guilty in this respect. It is hardly the case that 
  people are unaware of what is going on. The earlier conscription for the T.N.A. 
  was well known. The prevalence of armed sentries so small that their presence 
  is known only through gun barrels peeping over walls, is much talked about in 
  Jaffna. National newspapers too have presented photographs of baby faces carrying 
  AK 47s as though they were pop guns.<br>
  But the leading sections of society, whether religious authorities, professional 
  associations or associations of teachers, do not appear to acknowledge that 
  there is a problem. There is, rather, much glib talk of the &quot;Boys&quot; 
  delivering the goods. Some go so far as to justify the children being &quot;guided 
  and used&quot; in view of the manpower shortage resulting from the older boys 
  shying away from involvement. They would argue that these young persons have 
  to be sacrificed to protect the &quot;gains&quot; of the struggle in which so 
  much has already been lost. There is no questioning the kind of society we have 
  been creating through this struggle. It is hardly surprising that many visiting 
  outsiders have been astounded by these attitudes. This insensitivity and moral 
  degradation is seen to go much deeper, when one looks at the politics that is 
  articulated by the Tamil elite. Anyone who stands out and projects a qualitative 
  difference, is isolated and destroyed. The weapons used may include slander, 
  the misuse of institutional power and more indirectly, even murder.<br>
  What we have today is a weak society tending towards fascist regimentation. 
  It has produced so-called traitors in dizzying proportions and little that is 
  creative. To hide its mediocrity and the poverty of human qualities in its leadership, 
  it needs to strengthen patronage and stifle intellectual development. This is 
  reflected in its politics. There is a cost to the propaganda edifice that is 
  being erected in Tamil Nadu, incorporating the Tamil militant struggle in Ceylon 
  and the militarism of the Chola empire (from the 10th to the 13th centuries 
  A.D.) so as to project a Dravidian racial mystique. This cost must eventually 
  be borne by misused children and paid for in the blood of hapless victims.<br>
  In the South, the discomfiture of the J.V.P. has been achieved at the cost of 
  brutalising the armed forces and the society to a degree far greater than what 
  prevailed during the Tamil campaign. A conservative estimate of the number of 
  Sinhalese youth killed or disappeared, in the course of the campaign by the 
  government forces and paramilitary groups, is put at well over 8000. Newspapers 
  routinely report bodies floating down rivers and charred bodies, usually around 
  half a dozen, being discovered by the roadside in some remote village. Following 
  the killing of two lawyers, there was much fear of filing habeas corpus applications. 
  The South paid a terrible price for allowing the rule of law to be subverted 
  since the passage of the prevention of Terrorism Act of 1979 in the name of 
  fighting Tamil separatism. No one is talking about the government's accountability 
  being a realisable goal for the foreseeable future. With politics having become 
  enmeshed with lawlessness, it is doubtful whether the rule of law can be restored 
  and the killer squads restrained by merely reversing legislation. <br>
  The recent killing of Richard de Zoysa, a respected dramatist and journalist, 
  and the disappearance of Lakshman Perera, U.N.P. municipal councillor for Mount 
  Lavinia, both of whom were close to a particular section of the ruling party, 
  raise questions of whether the internal politics of the ruling party is immune 
  from the killer politics it had engendered for its survival. In Ceylon which 
  had a long tradition of the military being subservient to the civilian authority, 
  one must now ask where the power balance between the two really lies. In the 
  de Zoysa and Lakshman Perera affairs, a large section of the cabinet appears 
  to have been in the dark.<br>
  What appeared in the local press regarding both these incidents which took place 
  in February 1990, poses several embarrassing questions for the state authorities. 
  The journalist community was both scared for its safety, and skeptical of statements 
  emanating from the government. The Minister for Information and Broadcasting 
  summoned a special press conference on 19 February to say that the involvement 
  of R.A.W., the Indian intelligence agency, was a possibility in Richard de Zoysa's 
  abduction. Speaking to the press the same day, the Minister for Defence and 
  Foreign Affairs ruled out the possibility of R.A.W.'s involvement. There was 
  to be more of this kind of contradictory statements from the government. Several 
  prominent media persons took no chances and flew out of the country.<br>
  What an opposition member said in the parliament on the subject illustrates 
  the enormity of the problem facing ordinary youth of the South: <br>
  &quot;We may not take notice of a hundred Richard de Zoysa's killed in Hambantota, 
  as indeed there have been. But the death of this man has pricked and wakened 
  the somewhat anaesthetised conscience of the middle class&quot;.<br>
  As regards the Tamil problem, there has been no ideological conflict between 
  the U.N.P. and the J.V.P.. In spite of having struck a deal with the L.T.T.E., 
  the government is yet to put forward to the Sinhalese electorate, the reasons 
  why power should be devolved to the Tamils. The conflict between the government 
  and the J.V.P. has the hallmarks of a struggle for survival on the part of the 
  former and one for power on the part of the latter. As much as the government 
  may wish to devolve some power to the Tamils for pragmatic reasons, including 
  that of marginalising India's role, whether it retains the required control 
  over the armed forces and the administrative machinery is another matter.<br>
  The weakness of the arrangements between the Sri Lankan state and the L.T.T.E. 
  result from ideological contradictions and conflicting aims, and the serious 
  intrinsic weakness of both parties. Given this, it would be a gross exaggeration 
  to say that Indian intentions have been defeated. True, a concert between the 
  L.T.T.E. and the Sri Lankan state, rendered the maintenance of Indian troops 
  on the ground a serious political liability. What India has now decided to do 
  is to cut its liabilities and handle the problem differently from a stronger 
  position. As the Indian presence was being whittled down, the euphoria in the 
  South had virtually evaporated in the face of disturbing reports and questions 
  in the press about the future. It would be very difficult for the Tamil party 
  and the Sri Lankan state to distance themselves from the narrow ideological 
  positions that have been built up over decades, particularly when a rival or 
  dissident faction could trip them up by stepping into their shoes. This is what 
  the J.V.P. had attempted to do. There are also pockets of discontent waiting 
  to be used, such as happened in the provoking of violence between the Tamils 
  and Muslims of the East in 1984. The importance of India in determining the 
  power balance should not be underestimated.<br>
  On India's part, in using nationalist feelings in Tamil Nadu to pursue foreign 
  policy objectives in Ceylon, it may have paid a heavier price in terms of its 
  own internal stability than it had bargained for.<br>
  All in all there are a number of possible scenarios, most of them gloomy. Perhaps 
  one lesson from all this is that the problems of Ceylon are to do with its own 
  historical inertia and jaundiced states of mind arising from it, and that outsiders 
  can do little to change this overnight. Some would contend that this is a historical 
  experience that the people of that country have to live through before being 
  forced to abandon their false values in the face of utter futility and desolation. 
  It is not a mechanical process. It is, rather, a process that will call forth 
  much individual courage. Indeed, it is under such conditions that some of the 
  most powerful religious experiences have been realised. With this in mind, concerned 
  outsiders, and, particularly, those who have undergone such experiences, can 
  play a sympathetic role in protecting those who take risks in standing up for 
  universal values and in providing encouragement to those who work for greater 
  accountability from those who wield power. (Appendix I gives a brief impressionistic 
  picture of recent developments.) [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</p>
