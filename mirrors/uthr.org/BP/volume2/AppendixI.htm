<p class=Headera align=center style='text-align:center;'><b><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>AN IMPRESSIONISTIC VIEW 
  OF THE SITUATION IN EARLY 1990</span></b></p>
<p class=Headera style='text-align:justify;'><b>I.1  January 1990: 
  A Time of Ironies</b></p>
<p class=Headera style='text-align:justify;'>By the end of December 1989, the 
  I.P.K.F. had withdrawn from all parts of the North-East, excluding Jaffna and 
  Trincomalee. A complete withdrawal, which is being insisted upon by the Sri 
  Lankan government, remains a painful dilemma for India. Such an event will no 
  doubt raise difficult questions in India, when it comes to counting the cost 
  against what has been achieved. The Tamil civilian population, both tired and 
  having lost all capacity for self-assertion, awaits events very much as before. 
  It accepted the Tiger's dominance in 1986 in the hope that, with one party in 
  control, life may be more orderly. When the Sri Lankan army launched its Operation 
  Liberation in May 1987 and was poised to enter Jaffna, the people wished that 
  the Tigers would go away instead of putting up a resistance that would be costly, 
  bloody and futile. They had welcomed the Indian army with great relief, after 
  the Indians had stopped the Sri Lankan army from taking Jaffna.When India got 
  into a conflict with the Tigers shortly afterwards, they fervently wished that 
  the Tigers would quickly make peace with India, lest the old adversary, the 
  Sri Lankan state, gain the advantage. Once talks between the L.T.T.E. and India 
  appeared to have finally broken down by October 1988, and India decided to back 
  the E.P.R.L.F. for the provincial leadership, many felt that the Tigers had 
  miscalculated and that some order would yet emerge. </p>
<p class=Headera style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>In areas recently 
  vacated by the I.P.K.F., people had watched the assertion of authority by the 
  Tigers and the Sri Lankan forces with mixed feelings. Just as in the aftermath 
  of the Indo-Lanka Accord, during August and September 1987, there is now relief 
  that irritations stemming from military conflict were, temporarily at least, 
  in abeyance. In suburban Jaffna where the air is full of talk of revenge killings 
  by pro-Indian groups, a grim reality today, many are awaiting the I.P.K.F.'s 
  departure just as they had wished for the Tigers' departure in the wake of the 
  incipient Sri Lankan offensive in June 1987. Killings by Tigers elsewhere are 
  much less talked about.</p>
<p class=Headera style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>Surprisingly 
  little interest is shown in corpses, evidently of Tamils, being washed ashore 
  in Vadamaratchi. A number of such corpses were burnt during the second half 
  of January. Of eight corpses washed ashore between Polikandy and Point Pedro 
  on 26 January, one was that of a child of two. Some were of women. Witnesses 
  said that injuries pointed to their having been subject to cannon fire. People 
  generally believed that the Sri Lankan navy had played a role in these killings. 
  When the matter was raised by India, the Sri Lankan authorities denied any involvement.</p>
<p class=Headera style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>In contrast 
  to the massacre by the Sri Lankan navy of passengers in the boat Kumudini, in 
  1985, and that of fisherman off Mandaitivu,in 1986 - both of which rightly had 
  the citizens' committees and church and community leaders voicing strong protest 
  - this time there was dead silence. The general talk is that the present victims 
  were supporters of the E.P.R.L.F. and others with family ties to them, who 
  now are fleeing to India in fear of reprisals. This silence raises questions 
  of whether the Tamils consciousness and identity, forged under the experience 
  of common oppression, was still in existence. This is also a pointer to the 
  ease with which differences among Tamils could be used. </p>
<p class=Headera style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>This has been 
  a time where the symbolism of events had been very different from the underlying 
  reality. For the Tamil people, it had been a time of mind boggling revision 
  of association of sentiments and events. Following the provincial council elections 
  in October 1988, there was evidently an elected government of the Tamil North-East, 
  led by a Tamil group (the E.P.R.L.F.), the Tigers having refused participation. 
  There was the promise of more powers being yielded to this government under 
  Indian pressure. But enthusiasm for this fulfilment of more than what the Tamils 
  had once hoped for, was evidently lacking.</p>
<p class=Headera style='text-align:justify;'><span></span> A Tamil National 
  Army (T.N.A.) too had come into being through Indian sponsored forced conscription, 
  with the stated purpose of protecting the Tamils. But its decimation by a concert 
  of the L.T.T.E. and the Sri Lankan forces was watched with indifference. The 
  fate of innocent conscripts from the poorer classes elicited little or no public 
  concern. Many of these conscripts who had little training or motivation, were 
  killed in large numbers, some after capture. Some were killed by their own side 
  as they tried to surrender. The more fortunate were ceremonially handed over 
  to their parents by the L.T.T.E.. Ironically, the areas which passed back to 
  the nominal control of the once odious Sri Lankan army, were even spoken of 
  as 'cleared'. The E.P.R.L.F. which had once annoyed Tamil nationalist circles 
  by standing for a united socialist Lanka, was now threatening the Sri Lankan 
  government with U.D.I. (Unilateral Declaration of Independence). On the other 
  hand the L.T.T.E. which had for years refused to negotiate with the Sri Lankan 
  state on the grounds that the terms on offer did not satisfy their demand for 
  a separate state of Tamil Eelam, had now reached a tactical understanding with 
  the Sri Lankan state that even involved operational links.</p>
<p class=Headera style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>As for the Indian 
  soldiers in Ceylon, their feelings evinced a mixture of bitterness, puzzlement 
  and anger. They felt that they had come to help the Tamils and had lost over 
  a thousand dead. The &quot;treacherous politics&quot; of the Tamils, they felt, 
  had turned their benevolence into humiliation and waste. They had little understanding 
  of the role of their state and army, and the enormous civilian suffering that 
  had contributed to this state of affairs. </p>
<p class=Headera style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>Veteran Tamil 
  Nationalist leaders A. Amirthalingam and V. Yogeswaran were assassinated in 
  Colombo on 13 July, 1989. Their politics had articulated the feelings of the 
  rising generation of educated Tamils of the 1950s who were facing the first 
  stirrings of discrimination. To write about their lives and their significance 
  is, by itself, a task for a professional biographer. It suffices to say here 
  that their strengths, their weaknesses and even their capitulations were not 
  dissimilar to those of the younger generation of militant leaders in whom they 
  aroused feelings of hatred, as well as a sense of betrayal. Besides feelings 
  of grief and nostalgia among members of the public, they also leave behind anger.</p>
<p class=Headera style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>For reasons 
  well understood in Colombo, the affiliations of their killers remained for months, 
  officially at least, a mystery. By early 1990, however, the press in Colombo 
  started treating people to conflicting reports in keeping with the general spirit 
  of the times. The Colombo based Tamil daily, the Virakesari, carried reports 
  according to which, at public meetings in the North and the East, L.T.T.E. spokesmen 
  gave reasons why they killed Amirthalingam. The English language press on the 
  other hand, carried reports quoting senior L.T.T.E. spokesmen in Colombo denying 
  the L.T.T.E.'s having a hand in the killings. Interestingly, the denials and 
  the affirmations sometimes appeared on the same day. </p>
<p class=Headera style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>Those who did 
  the killings were themselves gunned down by security men, and came to be commemorated 
  as martyrs on wall posters which appeared in the Tamil areas. Ironically, Yogeswaran 
  too would certainly have been accliamed as a martyr to the Tamil cause, had 
  he died years earlier, when he narrowly escaped death during the officially 
  instigated police rampage in Jaffna in1981. This symbolic act of parricide which 
  ended the lives of these nationalist leaders, marks a shift in the actors, rather 
  than in the politics and its motivating principles.</p>
<p class=Headera style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>In the South, 
  the J.V.P.'s insurgency and the government's military response to it through 
  far more indiscriminate killing, had resulted in several, perhaps tens of, thousands 
  being murdered. These represented further refinements of the diabolical methods 
  developed by the state in the face of the Tamil insurgency. There were well 
  authenticated reports of mass burnings of corpses and of mutilated corpses floating 
  down rivers. Following the killing of an Assistant Registrar in 1989 , the University 
  of Peradeniya was the scene of a gory reprisal where about 15 severed heads 
  were placed around a pond in the university's centre. Southern human rights 
  activists have received accounts of many such victims having been picked at 
  random from detention and rehabilitation centres run by the Sri Lankan government. 
  University authorities have put the number of university students missing in 
  the South at over 240 and still rising. Temporarily at least, the government 
  had reasons to put on a more benevolent face in the Tamil areas. A sizable section 
  of the Tamil leadership had few qualms about expressing confidence in the new 
  leadership of President Premadasa during this tragic situation engulfing the 
  South, in spite of their own historical experience of the same U.N.P. leadership.</p>
<p class=Headera style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>Clearly, little 
  had changed. There was a repetitive character behind the lack of principle and 
  opportunism governing these events. Far from learning anything, the actors were 
  becoming increasingly trapped by their schemes and their ideological predilections. 
  Every move had a note of desperation that went little beyond immediate survival.In 
  this situation of alliances under-pinned by nothing more than immediate expediency, 
  no actor however discomfited at one time can be dismissed. The prospects of 
  lasting peace grow even more distant.<u></u></p>
<p class=Headera style='text-align:justify;'><b>I.2  The Tamil National 
  Army</b></p>
<p class=Headera style='text-align:justify;'>It has been pointed out that, although 
  the older militant groups recruited volunteers and sent them for training in 
  India, in due course these recruits came to hate and despise the civilian population. 
  In June 1989, India launched the formation of the T.N.A. by conscription, forcibly 
  taking in young boys who not only did not want to fight, but also did not believe 
  in the legitimacy of the cause. The stage was thus being set for a major social 
  disaster. It is established from a number of testimonies that training was given 
  by Indian Instructors. To understand this, one must look at the problems of 
  strategy created for India, in the wake of President Premadasa's call on 1 June 
  1989, that the I.P.K.F. be withdrawn. It is not in the nature of India's relationship 
  with the E.P.R.L.F. for India to pump in huge resources into a plan conceived 
  by the E.P.R.L.F.. Even after the I.P.K.F. had formally ceased operations on 
  20 September 1989, Indian troops continued to surround localities and search, 
  looking for escaped conscripts. Publicly however, India denied any links with 
  T.N.A..</p>
<p class=Headera style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>The T.N.A., 
  sent into action after a mere few weeks of training, and with little motivation 
  and a feeling of abandonment, were effectively cannon fodder, even with their 
  ample weaponry. Their actions were motivated by the demands of survival and 
  sometimes by elemental hatreds. Driven to hopeless despair by the designs of 
  powers around them, several of them even showed a touching concern for difficulties 
  faced by others who were better off. </p>
<p class=Headera style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>In Amparai in 
  late October 1989, some Tamils in a crowd were asked to move out and about 40 
  Muslims were mowed down by the T.N.A.. Some members of the T.N.A. who tried 
  to surrender were fired upon by their own side. Despite the Tigers having made 
  much propaganda out of the conscription of unwilling Tamil youths and schoolboys, 
  the fate of T.N.A. members falling into Tiger hands varied. Many were released 
  to their parents. Others suffered as people suffer in the hands of an angry 
  conquering army. In Batticaloa, in mid-December, an estimated 50 or so T.N.A. 
  members were found shot dead with their hands tied, after they had surrendered, 
  following the killing of an L.T.T.E. leader.</p>
<p class=Headera style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>There were also 
  many instances where T.N.A. members acted with pathetic concern for others. 
  An incident at Kopay junction in December illustrates the deep hopelessness 
  felt by many. A young man going on a motor cycle to Vadamaratchi was detained 
  by a group of I.P.K.F. and T.N.A. men at Kopay, for not having a pass. A T.N.A. 
  boy was asked to guard him.The young man told the boy that he had left his pass 
  behind as he had been in a hurry to go and see his sick mother. The boy thought 
  for a while and murmured,&quot;I too have a mother.&quot;. The boy then offered 
  the young man his AK47 rifle and told him,&quot;If I let you go, I will face 
  punishment.Here, take this gun, shoot me, and go. They will then think that 
  you escaped&quot;. The young man who could not believe his ears, found that 
  the boy was in earnest. He then talked to the boy and dissuaded him. The young 
  man's release was later secured by another T.N.A. member who told the Indian 
  officer that the young man was his cousin.</p>
<p class=Headera style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>In the E.P.R.L.F. 
  itself there were many who were disturbed by the conscription, and actively 
  aided the escape of T.N.A. boys under their command. A group of nine escapees 
  who were released at Neervely by the L.T.T.E. in mid-December, 1989, said that 
  conditions and food had been demoralising. They had slept on the floors of huts, 
  trying to keep out rain water with sacks. Their leaders slept on railway sleepers. 
  At Chavakacheri, they had been advised by sympathetic E.P.R.L.F. men to get 
  transferred to Pandeteruppu from where they would be helped to escape. At Pandeteruppu, 
  their E.P.R.L.F. leader asked them to run away and that he would take the punishment 
  for their escape. The punishment would take the form of deprivations and beating.</p>
<p class=Headera style='text-align:justify;'><span></span> In some places 
  the attitude of the T.E.L.O. showed surprising originality. At Trincomalee, 
  the T.E.L.O. gained popularity at the expense of the E.P.R.L.F. and the E.N.D.L.F. 
  by telling young men to say, when they are picked up for conscription, that 
  they are already registered with the T.E.L.O. for military training .The T.E.L.O. 
  then put them through some token motions such as carrying a gun and then released 
  them. In other places, the T.E.L.O. got young men to fill up forms and let them 
  go. These forms were evidently used to procure Indian resources.</p>
<p class=Headera style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>When T.N.A. 
  boys get killed, they are just statistics - 40, 60 or 100 - in the march of 
  history. When militants allied to India get killed, many civilians would dismiss 
  them as traitors. Their tragedy, their inner agony and their many instances 
  of nobility and heroism, are seldom talked about. For their own people, to try 
  to understand is an unwanted burden. For the decision makers in high places 
  in New Delhi, it is well to remember that many of their victims were far greater 
  men than themselves.</p>
<p class=Headera style='text-align:justify;'><b>I.3  The Tamil Militant 
  Groups</b></p>
<p class=Headera style='text-align:justify;'>Of the Tamil militant groups, the 
  E.P.R.L.F., the T.E.L.O. and the E.N.D.L.F. allied themselves with India. The 
  P.L.O.T.E., though having lost its political appeal, maintained a strong presence 
  of fighting men in the Wanni. It had recruited there in the early 1980s when 
  it made a greater appeal. After October 1987, it steered a line independent 
  of the I.P.K.F.. At the beginning of the second half of 1989, it withstood a 
  major attack by the L.T.T.E. in which the latter is said to have had the backing 
  of Sri Lankan forces. Its present fate is unclear, after it was dislodged from 
  Chettikulam in early January, 1990, following heavy fighting. It has to contend 
  with a hostile environment using its residual appeal. Its leader, Uma Mahesweran 
  was assassinated in Colombo in July 1989.</p>
<p class=Headera style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>The E.R.O.S. 
  appears to have been successful up to a point in avoiding committing itself 
  to any course that involved risk. It survived as an organisation without being 
  thanked by anyone. Its political weakness was a consequence of its worship of 
  tactical survival at the cost of principles. It was very unhappy with the L.T.T.E. 
  going to war with India, but later appears to have come to an understanding 
  with the L.T.T.E..</p>
<p class=Headera style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>E.R.O.S.'s operations 
  had the same character as before, giving the public a learned appearance and 
  using the gun and terror where there were easy pickings. A particular episode, 
  that of the disappearance of Mr. Kanthasamy, was revealing. Mr. K.Kanthasamy, 
  a dedicated rehabilitation worker who had the trust of several donor agencies, 
  returned from his exile and set about planning rehabilitation projects for the 
  North-East in early 1988. He was also the founder secretary of the Tamil Refugees 
  Rehabilitation Organisation. The E.R.O.S. applied pressure on him to channel 
  funds for projects in Trincomalee through a front organisation. Kanthasamy stood 
  firm and the pressure mounted and took the form of threats. On 19 June 1988, 
  Kanthasamy was kidnapped. When appeals were made by individuals to E.R.O.S. 
  leaders, the response reportedly took the form of arrogant maligning of Kanthasamy. 
  Kanthasamy ,a heart patient, joined the ranks of the disappeared. The E.R.O.S. 
  then issued a statement praising Kanthasamy and appealing for his freedom. The 
  facts are given in records that were left behind by Kanthasamy and published 
  by his associates in London. Kanthasamy was an organised person who maintained 
  systematic records.</p>
<p class=Headera style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>On 15 February 
  1989, the E.R.O.S. contested and did well in the parliamentary elections, although 
  the L.T.T.E. had banned any participation in the electoral process, and had 
  killed two candidates from other parties. The E.R.O.S. did nothing to condemn 
  the L.T.T.E.'s actions and demand from all parties a respect for freedom to 
  express ideas. It earned its prize without risking fighting for the principle 
  of democracy. It was widely believed that the E.R.O.S. had made a deal with 
  the L.T.T.E..</p>
<p class=Headera style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>In March 1989, 
  the E.R.O.S. did a public service, when its M.P.'s visited Mullaitivu during 
  heavy fighting and exposed the misery of the civilian population. But its methods 
  began to breed all round resentment. Its cadre became occasional victims of 
  pro-Indian groups who looked upon the E.R.O.S. as having benefited from dirty 
  work done by them. Later, in the first half of 1989, the bodies of six E.R.O.S. 
  members were found after they reportedly went to an I.P.K.F. camp in the Wanni. 
  At the end of 1989, the L.T.T.E. issued a leaflet condemning the E.R.O.S. as 
  receiving training from the R.A.W..</p>
<p class=Headera style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>The E.R.O.S. 
  in earlier years did recruit well motivated and able men, many of whom became 
  unhappy with the organisation's compromised position. Whether the leadership 
  can rethink and give the organisation a future is left to be seen.</p>
<p class=Headera style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>In the case 
  of the E.P.R.L.F., the process of militarisation set in motion by the Indian 
  involvement in 1983 and the success of the L.T.T.E. and T.E.L.O., first drove 
  it to despair and finally to madness. From the beginning the E.P.R.L.F. had 
  to swim against the dominant trends in Jaffna society. Its early members were 
  able young men influenced by Marxist ideas, who left school early and went into 
  political work in the villages. But the social prestige, as well as fund-collections, 
  largely went to the groups demonstrating military success. In its own drive 
  for militarisation, the E.P.R.L.F. recruited a large number of persons from 
  the depressed classes and gave them guns. They were used without political education 
  to give them self-confidence, infusing in them a sense of purpose, or giving 
  them the awareness to challenge the dominant elitist ideology. The guns these 
  recruits had, without giving them a sense of dignity, provided them with a 
  means of expressing resentment against society in general. Instead of challenging 
  the dominant ideology and the oppressive aspects of Tamil social tradition, 
  it reinforced prejudices flowing from them. Since the L.T.T.E. was a military 
  organisation which did not articulate a social program, traditional elements 
  in society found it easy to sympathise and even form tactical links with it. 
  And while the E.P.R.L.F. was unable to act as a liberating influence and mould 
  the depressed classes into a political force, the L.T.T.E. could take recruits 
  from the same classes and mould them effectively into a military force.</p>
<p class=Headera style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>When the E.P.R.L.F. 
  returned in the company of the I.P.K.F. in August 1987, it did so with a strong 
  urge for revenge against the L.T.T.E. and a deep resentment against the people. 
  In time, the use made of them by the I.P.K.F. made them suspicious and resentful 
  of people in general. The I.P.K.F.'s use of them as hit men and informants 
  operating from I.P.K.F. camps, completely destroyed their political potential. 
  Even after realising power through the Provincial Council, they lacked the party 
  discipline and ability to mobilise support from sections of the population whose 
  just grievances had not been addressed by the politics of the Jaffna elite - 
  grievances concerning the depressed classes in Jaffna, various regional issues 
  and the Muslim problem, among others. In reprisals after attacks by the L.T.T.E., 
  they took the cue from the I.P.K.F.. Instead of mobilisation towards liberation, 
  what the depressed classes saw from them was greater inexplicable brutality 
  than that suffered by influential sections. The depressed classes had the worst 
  of killings, beatings and destruction of property. People sometimes came to 
  regard themselves lucky if detained by the I.P.K.F. rather than its allies who 
  were sons of this community. The E..P.R.L.F.'s participation in the I.P.K.F.'s 
  conscription program was a reflection of its powerlessness as well as a loss 
  of any sense of reality. With the prospect of the I.P.K.F. going in early 1990, 
  leaving them high and dry, pretending that the T.N.A. would protect them, their 
  anger turned against the people rather than against India. The I.P.K.F. did 
  nothing to deter their ruinous conduct. Anyone who was suspected of harbouring 
  L.T.T.E. sympathies was in danger of being killed. Some members of the E.P.R.L.F. 
  and other militant groups aligned to the I.P.K.F., during their last days in 
  Jaffna, visited many cruelties on the civilians, including the murder of the 
  Jaffna Kachcheri accountant who argued against an unfair instruction. Again, 
  it was as usual the depressed classes who felt most helpless against this orgy 
  of indiscipline and blind fury. Having begun as a movement with socialist and 
  democratic ideals, its final role was to strengthen the dominant politics of 
  Tamil society, rein-force its hierarchical and totalitarian drift, and to destroy 
  for many years to come, the prospect of an alternative.</p>
<p class=Headera style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>Those who aspire 
  to leadership should be judged harshly for their misuse of opportunities and 
  authority, and for murdering those whom they were meant to protect. In looking 
  at this situation however, it is well for us to try and understand it. We must 
  also look at the role of the society, its opportunism, insensitivity, shallowness 
  and its immense capacity to stifle and destroy youthful potential. We must 
  look also at the destructiveness of the dominant politics and, in particular, 
  the role of the L.T.T.E.. The early leaders of the E.P.R.L.F. were once young 
  men who were motivated by ideals into doing political work. Our society did 
  not give them admiration or respect. There was no serious opposition to the 
  L.T.T.E.'s banning them in December 1986, killing over 50 of their members in 
  custody by April 1987 and even branding them first as anti-social elements and, 
  later on, as traitors. The L.T.T.E. would not only not allow them to do political 
  work, but also sought to destroy them without even the honour that was their 
  due. The anger of young men placed in that position should be understood, although 
  it cannot be justified politically or morally.</p>
<p class=Headera style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>Once in the 
  I.P.K.F. bandwagon, the E.P.R.L.F. lost many of its abler leaders who had earlier 
  stayed on. Many of its cadre had little idea of what they were going to do, 
  except to have the prospect of ignominious death hanging over them. The E.P.R.L.F.'s 
  late Trincomalee leader, George Thambirajah, had told a class-mate on his return 
  to Trincomalee in August 1987,&quot;I know that the L.T.T.E. will get me one 
  day. Before that I will take as many of them as I can down with me.&quot; Another 
  leader who had been a pleasant, dedicated young man in his earlier years said: 
  &quot;We did political work once. That was not appreciated. We were not allowed 
  to work. Like Stalin, we had to take a decision to survive. So we decided to 
  kill&quot;. The organisation had come a long way from 1986, when it had maintained 
  a democratic structure, and had mostly avoided the resort to internal or other 
  killings which were rife in other prominent militant groups.</p>
<p class=Headera style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>Mannar town 
  was one place where the E.P.R.L.F. had earned itself an acceptable name with 
  the public. A few days before the I.P.K.F.'s departure in December 1989 and 
  the re-entry of the L.T.T.E., some foot-ball players from schools were on their 
  way to an L.T.T.E. sponsored match. When asked by the E.P.R.L.F., they said 
  that they would be in trouble if they failed to go. The E.P.R.L.F. men looked 
  sombre. They said,&quot;We will not stop you or cause you trouble. You need 
  not have any anxiety over fighting here. We are withdrawing. We have tried to 
  maintain an understanding relationship with the people in our area. But now 
  there is nothing we can do. Those from our group elsewhere have misbehaved with 
  the people. We will leave this place and go to some other country&quot;.</p>
<p class=Headera style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>Another said, 
  &quot;I brought several of my close friends into this organisation.They have 
  now been killed as traitors. My parents are influential and I could have lived 
  comfortably. I stayed on to prove that my friends who died were not traitors&quot;.</p>
<p class=Headera style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>Although generally 
  suspicious of civilians and instinctively aggressive, some of these militants 
  would, seeing that no ill was meant, listen after being shouted at. They would 
  even listen submissively on being told that they were no longer a political 
  force, and that many of them had once been young men who wanted to do some good, 
  but had now become psychiatric patients. Some of them would admit that the 
  T.N.A. was a total disaster, but would not say who promoted it. They even felt 
  that the only way to regain some credibility was to disband the T.N.A., ask 
  parents to take their children away and make a confession before the public. 
  But they were doubtful if the leadership would accept it. They were also crucially 
  dependent on India for their security. A public confession would have to say 
  many things embarrassing to India. Having come to depend on India, they would 
  in time suffer the tragic fate of those who were used by a big power and proved 
  an embarrassment later on. Those who survived the arduous crossing to India 
  would meet with rejection and humiliation, in sharp contrast to earlier days,following 
  July 1983.</p>
<p class=Headera style='text-align:justify;'><b>I.4  India and the Indian 
  Peace </b></p>
<p class=Headera style='text-align:justify;'><b><span> </span>Keeping 
  Force</b></p>
<p class=Headera style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";letter-spacing:-.1pt'>To 
  arrive at a proper understanding of this episode, one must try to get away from 
  the strong emotions that this has engendered. The average Indian officer can 
  only see an ungrateful population set against the deaths of many comrades. Civilian 
  deaths, agony and anger do not exist for him. They did their job the only way 
  they were trained to do it, they would contend. If you want to blame anyone, 
  blame the politicians, they would say. It has been a temptation for many Tamils 
  to use racial sentiments found in the West to malign an army from a poor third 
  world country. That would be unfair. The Indian Army has the professional qualities 
  to be used as a disciplined force. Reprisals have mostly been carried out in 
  a planned manner, intended to terrorise.</span></p>
<p class=Headera style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>The failure 
  of the Indian Army is largely a consequence of arrogance and, stemming from 
  it, a refusal to understand and respect civilian feelings. Considering the 
  stakes India had in this situation, the number of Indians who came here with 
  a view to making a serious study of the situation was low, in comparison with 
  the number of Westerners who came here. Most damaging, apart from a deliberate 
  decision to use terror in most difficult situations, were political decisions 
  by the I.P.K.F.. While pleading that they were not politicians, but were military 
  men doing only a military job, they used their powers freely to experiment with 
  politics - forming citizens committees, censoring the press, directing the actions 
  of militant groups, and so on. The decision to terrorise L.T.T.E. supporters 
  through murder during the run up to the provincial council elections in October 
  1988, was a political decision of the I.P.K.F.. From the talk of some officials, 
  this appears to have been made on the premise that, because Jaffna Tamils were 
  opportunistic enough to accept the mass killings of T.E.L.O. members in mid-1986 
  in exchange for order, they would once again accept the decimation of L.T.T.E. 
  supporters for the same reason. Such decisions determined the negative attributes 
  which were fatal for the E.P.R.L.F.-led provincial administration. The I.P.K.F.'s 
  opposition to the L.T.T.E. was not based on a political critique of the L.T.T.E.. 
  There was, rather, much admiration for the L.T.T.E. amongst I.P.K.F. officers. 
  For an army placed as the I.P.K.F. was, political decisions were certainly 
  necessary. They should at least have been taken in keeping with democratic principles 
  subscribed to by India, rather than left to casual arrogance.</p>
<p class=Headera style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>Perhaps the 
  most inexcusable decision of India's was to form the T.N.A. by forced conscription. 
  It was done under conditions which lacked both accountability and legitimacy. 
  Neither the I.P.K.F. nor the E.P.R.L.F. led administration, had earned the latter. 
  It was done in a manner that was callous, offensive and degrading. Young boys 
  were picked off the streets, long distance buses and trains. To poor and defenceless 
  parents was added the agony and the tedium of going from place to place and 
  from camp to camp, in an attempt to trace their sons. These wretches, numbering 
  the thousands, were given meagre training and armed to survive as best as they 
  could. They were disowned by almost all, including India. For many, this single 
  act of forced conscription, terminated any feeling that India could play a constructive 
  role.</p>
<p class=Headera style='text-align:justify;'><span></span> What prompted 
  this high-level decision which was, at once, indefensible, irresponsible and 
  even tactically unsound ? Who in the Indian hierarchy made this decision on 
  conscription? Whose interests were being represented here? Or was it the decision 
  of a bankrupt bureaucracy that just wanted to try something, however stupid?</p>
<p class=Headera style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>During early 
  1988, an Indian General told a university delegation that recovering arms is 
  an extremely difficult job, adding that for this purpose they would use &quot;these 
  gun-toting rascals&quot; and then disarm them. The reference was to pro-Indian 
  groups. He explained that every non-professional person carrying a gun was a 
  rascal. Having started with a disarming operation, India has now turned to 
  flooding the place with arms and in militarising those already disillusioned 
  with what had happened. There was no more talk of rehabilitation.</p>
<p class=Headera style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>For young Indian 
  soldiers, it is time for home thoughts. On the streets you may see one examining 
  a new pair of trousers collected from the tailors. Another might test his newly 
  purchased pocket radio. Those more curious would chat with the civilians. &quot;In 
  Mannar, the people were nice to us. But in Jaffna it is different&quot;, they 
  would say. They too had discovered that many houses in Jaffna have some member 
  abroad. One may hear them remark, &quot;So, when the troubles begin, you will 
  leave the others and go away&quot;. They too are a simple people like ourselves, 
  taking a simple joy in the simple and inexpensive things of life. With India 
  very much a part of our nurture, it is a pity that our actual encounter has 
  left many bitter memories. </p>
<p class=Headera style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>For thousands 
  of our young men, so thoughtlessly used by India, there can never be home thoughts.[<a href="#top">Top</a>]</p>
