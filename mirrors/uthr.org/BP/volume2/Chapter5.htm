<p align=center style='text-align:center;'><b>War of October 1987</b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><b>5.1  Introduction</b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>Imperial psychology has over the centuries, developed 
  increasingly subtle and sophisticated means to subjugate and oppress people. 
  But with regard to women, it still employs the most barbaric forms of control 
  and repression - arrogance, dominance, men in battle garb, whether they come 
  with swords or guns, on a horse or in armoured cars. The price of conquest seems 
  heightened by the violation of the women. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>Unquestionably, sexual violation is amongst the most 
  traumatic and degrading of experiences. But to restrict oneself to cases of 
  sexual violation would be giving a narrow picture of women's experiences in 
  war. I realised that the totality of women's experience in the war brought out 
  fundamental aspects of this war and the community. Therefore I wanted to hear 
  my sisters tell us their own versions of their travails, tragedies and triumphs</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><b>5.2  A village in Central Jaffna: </b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><b>A Woman's Story </b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>The rich ochre soil contrasted with the shady trees and 
  market gardens dotting our way along the single main road. The morning was still 
  young and fresh, unlike two months ealier, when the sickening smell of death 
  hung like a pall of smoke. This was in the heartland of agricultural Jaffna, 
  where the rich soil is normally extensively cultivated, but now, was almost 
  untended. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>One cannot romanticise for long the mornings in rural 
  Jaffna; nor can one forget the &quot;past&quot; as Indian army officials urge 
  us to. The past, was and still is a gruesome reality in these villages. The 
  inert, the gaping caved-in houses, and the burnt out shells of one time houses, 
  all speak of the past. Suddenly shattering the quietness, come the open vehicles 
  of the Indian Army. Flaunting their power and masochism ride the officers in 
  olive green uniforms. Every half mile there is a sentry point. I sailed past 
  one, as one was now used to them in the city. Suddenly I heard the rasping command 
  &quot;Down, down, down, walk&quot;. I was pretty careful after that. On the 
  way I met patrols walking along the road like in the early days of the war with 
  all the paraphernalia, including shelling equipment, on their shoulders. Yes, 
  war was here and war is still here. I met the women together and individually, 
  some in their work places some in their houses. They were still picking up pieces 
  of their lives, sorting out the furniture that survived, or sweeping the debris 
  .</span></p>
<span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";"Times New Roman";'><br clear=all style='page-break-before:auto;
'>
</span> 
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>The main narrator was a young working mother in whose 
  house everything had been burnt. They were living along the main road in the 
  vicinity of the Amman Kovil in the village of Urelu. From 10 October there was 
  a curfew on, all over the peninsula. On the 11th they saw about forty Tigers, 
  fully armed, moving along the road quietly. The next day, that is 12 October, 
  from the early hours of the morning there started intense shell attacks from 
  the direction of the Palaly army camp. She said that they had to take shelter 
  under the bathroom flat because of the concrete reinforcement its roof had. 
  At about 4:30 a.m., they heard some movement and peeped out to see a large group 
  of Tigers moving in the direction of Urumpirai. Another interviewee said that 
  this group had stopped near their house in the vicinity of Urumpirai Hindu College 
  about, 300 to 400 yards away. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>Between 5:45 and 6:00 a.m, an Indian Army convoy was 
  seen in Urelu passing quietly along Palaly Road. She said: </span></p>
<p class=MsoBlockText>&quot;We heard a noise - may be a motar shell, possibly 
  from the Tigers and then, suddenly, hell was let loose. A fierce battle ensued 
  and firing started all round and went on continuously. I hugged my little one 
  and was immobile. The firing continued without respite till 9 'o clock. Then 
  it started quietening down&#148;.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>When they looked out, army men were crouched all round. 
  This woman and the family were contemplating moving further into the village. 
  She said: &quot;We saw in the house in front, the mother and her two year old 
  baby girl and thirteen year old daughter lying dead&quot;. They had found the 
  husband and the other eleven year old child injured inside the house. The husband 
  told us how, when he had looked out, the army had fired and he had run into 
  the house screaming. His wife and two kids had tried to escape to safety through 
  the back entrance and they were shot in cold blood. She was a mother holding 
  a two year old baby - not a gun. (It was not till the following day that the 
  neighbours were able to take the father and daughter to get medical treatment, 
  despatching them in a cart to Kopay Hospital). The narrator and her family, 
  while moving a little into the interior, had found the bodies of an old lady 
  and her son along the lane opposite their house. The old lady used to look after 
  the temple. They had also found the body of a man, around thirty-five years 
  of age, by the side of the lane. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>On the 13th they saw bombers over Urumpirai. Early on 
  the following day, the bombers came to Urelu and started bombing. They said: 
  </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>&quot;We know of three persons from the same house - 
  the grandmother, mother and a year old son - who died in the bombing. The husband 
  survived.&#148;</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>Later on, the same day, shelling started intensely, and 
  two sisters (around 35 to 45 years old) died as a result. Our narrator continued: 
  </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>&quot;We could not stand it any longer. We thought of 
  vacating the area completely. We left for the interior, many of us together 
  with our children and some of our elders. We loaded them on bicycles and scooters. 
  Some even walked. However, we had to leave many of our elderly in the houses. 
  They were too feeble to be moved around&#148;. </span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>They were confident that their elders would be spared and 
  that they could convince the army of their innocence. However when the residents 
  of this area came back, they could only see the skeletons and decaying bodies 
  of their elders and others who had stayed behind.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>One woman found the bodies of her next door neighbours, 
  a shop owner of fifty-two and his twenty year old son, in various stages of 
  decay. She also said: </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>&quot;In the lane opposite our house we found the skeleton 
  of a girl. We could only identify her from the clothes. We knew the young girl. 
  She had got a place in the university&#148;. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>The girl, they explained, had come back to collect some 
  things from the house, because they had evacuated in a hurry. She had wanted 
  to get something for her sister who was pregnant. The residents also found other 
  skeletons - of a woman who had come back to get some drugs for her invalid father 
  and of a man - with only their clothes left to identify them. Bottles were scattered 
  around the first skeleton and a shopping bag lay next to it. On the 15th the 
  woman had survived a bombing attack on her house, together with a neighbour 
  who had taken shelter with her. The daughter was hugging the mother when she 
  was shot. The same shot injured the mother, but did not kill her. The mother 
  had stayed in the house for almost 20 days drinking only water, with the corpses 
  of her husband and child rotting away. One woman said: </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>&#147;We were mentally prepared for the Sri Lankan army. 
  They chose an age bracket and it is mostly the men that they gunned down. But 
  the Indian army - we just could not believe it. We thought we could explain. 
  But they just fired! We women are stuck inside the house. Any way how could 
  we go to Nallur when they were shelling along the highways? I have my invalid 
  mother and little son. My husband is not here. How could I go?&quot;. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>Another woman said: </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>&quot;How many women and little children died? They could 
  not care less. Anybody, everybody, just a human form, if it moved, they shot 
  it down!&quot;.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>It was very clear from these women that there was no 
  attempt to differentiate the militants from the civilians. Though this operation 
  was to disarm the Tigers, any moving form in these villages in those early days 
  of war, was a Tiger for the Indian army, and was destined to be killed. And 
  the ages of the dead ranged from 1 or 2 years to 92 years. In the previous few 
  years, during the military operations of the Sri Lankan security forces, the 
  terror of getting rounded up and taken away, had made men between the ages of 
  14 and 40 (the targeted age bracket), leave the villages of their birth and 
  flee to countries all round the world as refugees, or join the militant struggle. 
  Furthermore, the 35 years of the state's policy of systematic employment restriction, 
  and economic deprivation and the deliberate non-development of Tamil areas, 
  had sent many young men to the Middle East and other areas in great numbers 
  to do menial jobs. The women were left behind to tend, care and keep life going. 
  </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><b>5.3  The case of the Disappeared</b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>From the hopeless 
  tragic finalities of death, we move on to the disappeared cases where hope is 
  the only basis around which life itself is constructed for the affected women 
  -sometimes very nebulous hope. Many of the disappearances were of persons taken 
  into custody in the search and round-up operations of the Indian Army. Some 
  had been taken in when they had left their homes to perform their daily routine 
  jobs. They were taken in from the road side, the market, the bank... While incidents 
  of gross killings were on the decline in Jaffna peninsula, disappearances were 
  on the rise and becoming a confounding problem. The Indian Army occasionally 
  releases lists of the detained but otherwise is lethargic and unhelpful in these 
  cases.</span></p>

  in by the I.P.K.F.. The others who were taken in with her husband were released 
  later. She never saw him again after the day of arrest. She was heartbroken 
  for he had gone to the house from the place of refuge solely for her sake, to 
  collect the necessities for her to be hospitalised for the birth. It happened 
  in November, 19 November to be precise. For the subsequent 4 months there was 
  not a single avenue that the woman had left untapped in finding her husband. 
  She had left no stone unturned. She had regularly scanned the lists of the detained 
  that the I.P.K.F. releases for a glimmer of hope. People around her murmured 
  that he is dead... She removed her pottu, the colourful spot worn on the forehead 
  by many Hinduwomen, to signify her loss. But in her heart of hearts and to us, 
  she insisted that he was still alive. She could not accept that he was dead. 
  Would we help?... Do we have hope for her and her infant?</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:

  previously, and she was four months pregnant. Of course he was a supporter of 
  L.T.T.E.'s, but after the Peace Accord and marriage, he had left politics to 
  settle down to mainstream life. On 27 January, he left his home for the market. 
  That was the last she saw of him. She has several conjectures. Either the I.P.K.F., 
  or even men from the T.E.L.O. might have taken him.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:

  had four daughters. On that unfortunate day, he had gone to Mullaitivu on a 
  business trip and walked into an area that was being evacuated by the I.P.K.F.. 
  The stories that reached her said that a man like her husband was seen to be 
  shot by the army and carried away. This woman, single handedly, had gone to 
  every camp in and around Mullaitivu and Vavuniya. She had gone to the highest 
  officials concerned. They could not tell her whether he was dead or alive. These 
  are but a few of the stories out of a list of more than the 300 disappearances 
  so far in Jaffna peninsula alone. The list is ever increasing.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><b>5.4  Rape and Molestation </b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>&quot;Why me? I ask myself whether by chance, something 
  in me made them think they could do this to me? I feel soild inside myself. 
  I feel small. Two months have gone by, but I think I am feeling worse. I was 
  scared to tell my husband- it was only recently that I wrote to him. I will 
  tell you my story if you say it will help other women&quot;. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>I had known this woman long ago. She was such a lively, 
  vivacious woman. Her smile and face have remained with me. I could readily recall 
  her maiden name, although we were at that time only acquaintances. I could not 
  accept that such a self-possessed woman could talk so dazedly. She is now a 
  38 year old professional woman with an 11 year old daughter. Her husband worked 
  abroad. She went on:</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>&quot;On 12 November, in the morning, three Indian soldiers 
  came to our house at about 8 o'clock. My mother was in the kitchen. Only my 
  daughter and I met them. They merely said: 'Checking,' and started pushing my 
  daughter into a room. I dragged her and shouted ' Amma, Amma, checking, checking' 
  Then the soldiers who were at the sentry point very near our house came running 
  to our house. The soldiers who were inside our house told the others that they 
  were only checking our house and did not stay long thereafter. My gold chain 
  had been stolen. We were scared. I then took my daughter and hid her in a small 
  box-room at the rear of the house and at about 9:30 we saw the same three soldiers 
  come again. This time they had not used the front gate where the sentry point 
  is located, but instead came through another vacant house, jumping over the 
  common parapet wall. Then they locked my parents in one room, took me to a room, 
  showed the gun and raped me, one after the other, all three of them. I did not 
  scream. What if they shot my parents? I can still recollect those beady eyes. 
  I could not handle it. I left the village, and Jaffna, as soon as the first 
  buses started running to Colombo. I started having nightmares. I started seeing 
  their faces and hearing voices. I took my daughter and we went abroad. I even 
  went to a psychiatrist. I could talk to him because he was a total stranger. 
  He gave me drugs. It quietened me, but it has not taken the trauma away. I am 
  becoming worse, much worse. At least I saved my daughter&#148;.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>Her daughter is well built and sweet for a 11 year old. 
  Yes, she definitely had saved her daughter from the trauma. She continued:</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>&quot;I have written to my husband and he says not to 
  worry. But you know our men. Do you think he will accept me? I try to go to 
  religious meetings and so on, but I cannot take part. I feel so apart from this 
  world. I feel different.&quot; </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>One had seen the shattered interior of a wounded woman. 
  However much one consoled and advised, it seemed so stupid. When I went home, 
  I felt exhausted, impotent and angry at ourselves, our class, our men and our 
  whole passive, stupid society.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>Then there is the story of another young girl. She was 
  only thirteen. Their house had once been a Tiger camp. The Indian army that 
  had come to search, separated the child from the others and raped her. The child 
  and family fled to Colombo. They were a well established middle class family. 
  They were not interested in identification or anything at all. They do not want 
  to hear any more of it and would rather let the trauma be buried in the recesses 
  of their memory.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>There is also the incident involving the rape of a 55 
  year old widow, and a 22 year old woman by two Indian soldiers in a poor Roman 
  Catholic area. It was an afternoon, between 2:00 p.m. and 3:00 p.m., on 18 November. 
  The Indian Army was stationed closeby in a church. The older woman was probably 
  seen first by the soldiers and, as she walked into her hut, they followed her 
  and raped her while she was screaming. At that time the younger woman had walked 
  into the back-yard to draw water from the well. On hearing the commotion, she 
  went up to the door and called &quot;Archie, Archie&quot; meaning &quot;Grandmother, 
  grandmother&quot;. The door was opened and she was dragged in and raped. The 
  girl being younger was able to free herself. She ran down the road screaming. 
  She was sobbing, as she cried, &quot;They have spoilt me&quot;.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>As a result, an angry crowd spontaneously gathered. Around 
  400 people marched shouting to the army camp. The soldiers stood with their 
  guns on the alert. The angry demonstrators continued to push forward. The commanding 
  officer of the camp appeared on the scene, asked the people to stop at a distance 
  and called in three people for an inquiry. They with the girl went up and told 
  the story. The older woman who was lying in pain in the hut was also brought 
  in and an identification parade took place. The two men were identified, and 
  the officer promised that they would be punished adequately after an inquiry.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>This is how another woman described her experience:</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>&quot;It happened in December, long after they had taken 
  our village. Our village had suffered so much death and destruction. One would 
  have hoped that we would have been spared this agony. On 19 December, I went 
  with a 25 year old friend of mine to make some tea for the people who were gathered 
  in our house. We were all mostly displaced people and had moved into houses 
  away from the main road. We were going to the house, a little up the lane. Actually 
  it was my sister-in-law's house. It was 11:30 a.m. and it was only when we were 
  in the proximity of the house that we noticed the soldiers standing at the top 
  of the lane. We could not go back, so we decided to go inside the house. As 
  we entered the house, the soldiers followed us and said that they had come for 
  checking. I said that it was not my house, and that I did not have all the keys. 
  They went on insisting on checking. In the process they separated me from my 
  young friend. They took her into a room. One took me around the house and harassed 
  me to show the rooms. We could not even shout. The dogs started barking fiercely. 
  By this time, the neighbours were aware that we two women were inside and came 
  <i>en masse</i> to the house. The soldiers then left.&quot;</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>Our narrator, a middle aged widow, told us how her companion 
  had been asked to lie on the bed at gun point, and threatened not to make a 
  sound. But the young woman, being a self-possessed working woman, had been able 
  to ward off the assailant and by this time the neighbours had come. But they 
  would not talk to anyone of authority. They were from a middle class background, 
  and were talking of how such things could ruin a young unmarried woman's future. 
  The group of women whom we were talking to, were careful to make the point that 
  nothing untoward had happened, lest this young woman's future should be ruined. 
  Thereafter, the young girl and other girls in the vicinity left for Colombo 
  directly. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>This is the story of a girl who was just 18 years old. 
  Her father was a labourer, a cigar roller. Despite this, he had educated his 
  daughter up to the G.C.E. Advanced Level. The incident took place on 23 December. 
  The Indian Army had in the previous days come to their garden to take their 
  chickens. That particular day, two soldiers came, separated the mother from 
  the daughter, held the mother at gun point and both men raped the girl in turn. 
  She was only a young girl and a virgin. Unlike the others, this girl identified 
  the rapists who were punished by the army. The doctor who examined her, remembers 
  this story vividly. He said, &quot;Its so tragic, she was such a dynamic young 
  girl. I admire the courage of the girl.&quot;</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>Another doctor who was consulted in a case of rape told 
  us: </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>&quot;Those were the early days of the war. They brought 
  a young girl studying in high school. Her parents were farmers and were old. 
  The Indian Army took her for questioning on16 November, because of a photograph. 
  The girl was in the photograph with her class mate, who was the sister of an 
  alleged Tiger. She was taken to the camp and questioned on the whereabouts of 
  this boy and her connection with him. The captain threatened verbally to beat 
  her up and even rape her unless she came out with the truth about the boy and 
  alleged that he was her boyfriend. However, after questioning, they brought 
  her home, and the captain gave her an ultimatum of 24 hours to think about it. 
  After sometime, two soldiers turned up at her place, kept her parents to a side, 
  took her to a room and one of them raped her. She had started bleeding. Then 
  one man said that they would come the next day and warned her not to tell the 
  mother and left. The girl became desperate and jumped into their well. Fortunately 
  she was rescued by the neighbours. While this commotion had been going on, the 
  captain arrived on a patrol or some such thing, and with him were the men as 
  well. The captain, most probably thinking that she had jumped because of his 
  threats, patted her on the head, assuring her that he would not do such a thing 
  to her and asked her to tell him if there were any problems. But at that time 
  she had kept mum, because the rapists were with him.&quot; </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>Later, however, the family took her to this doctor who 
  had urged her to report the incident. And she courageously did so and identified 
  the men.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>These were the days of full blown &quot;normalcy&quot; 
  where Indian Army officials were bent on convincing all and sundry that life 
  had almost returned to normal. People were going back to their old villages, 
  repairing shelled houses, and trying to live. The month of January was almost 
  drawing to a close, but we realised that as far as women were concerned, the 
  time factor, or the so called normality, did not bring respite. It seemed that 
  the soldiers were relieving their &quot;battle fatigue&quot; on us. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>She was a 22 year old student. Her father was semi-blind. 
  The whole family depend on her brother who had a shop in Chilaw. On 29 January, 
  the father and daughter left their home with prepared food for the mother who 
  had been in the temple since 24 January, for religious observances. When they 
  got near the temple four soldiers inspected their identity cards. One took a 
  long time over hers. When asked for the time, she had said that it was 12:10 
  p.m.. They asked the father to sit down and for her to walk down the lane leading 
  to the temple. Sensing danger, she started protesting, but she was threatened 
  at gun point and made to walk alone. One of the soldiers stood on guard with 
  the father while the other three walked behind her. When they were near an abandoned 
  hut, she was taken into the bushes. While one stood on guard, the others raped 
  her. After the men had left, the young woman collected her disabled father, 
  went to the temple and joined her mother. Later, she and her father went to 
  the nearest camp and reported the incident. There she was asked to go to a bigger 
  camp. At the larger camp they held an identification parade and she identified 
  the four soldiers. She was advised to treat the matter at a private clinic and 
  report the next day.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>We now bring the desperate tale of a young woman who 
  chose not to live through this shame that was brought on her. On 25 January, 
  her body was recovered from the well in her house. Her parents had died during 
  shelling by the Sri Lankan Army in January, 1987. She was 30 years old. On the 
  24th night, when she was in the house with two other women, Indian soldiers 
  came and knocked. The inmates had not wanted to open, but the insistent knocks 
  had made the now dead girl comment that they might have come only for a search! 
  While the three of them were discussing, the knocks continued unabated. When 
  they opened the door, the woman of 30 ran away fearing danger. The Indian soldiers 
  were there for a few minutes and went away after seeing that the younger woman 
  had run away. None knew her story till her dead body was found. The Judicial 
  Medical Officer who conducted the postmortem, found clear marks of rape (such 
  as laceration of the vagina, and contusion of the labia). </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>Although there are many more cases of rape, we have presented 
  only a few sample cases. As one woman activist observed; </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>&quot;Rape occurred mainly in November and December, 
  when the families were trickling in from the refugee camps to their old homes. 
  Many women were quite isolated, with few neighbours being around. It provided 
  ample opportunity for the soldiers to rape. Many of the women were beaten before 
  being raped.&#148;</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>One of my young friends and her little sister once had 
  to go through an I.P.K.F. checkpoint when they were fleeing from village to 
  village. My friend said angrily how the hands of the soldiers had invaded the 
  privacy of their bodies, pawing and feeling them all over. The worst was when 
  after a long silence, her little sister had asked her &quot;Akka</span><sup><span
style='font-size:9.0pt'>1</span></sup><span style='font-size:10.0pt'> - what did 
  the soldiers do to us - is that what they call rape?&quot; In sharp contrast 
  to the sad plight of this sheltered innocence was our encounter with the Indian 
  Army authorities with their utter callousness and contempt for our women. &quot;I 
  am only trying to explain to this young lady,&quot; an Indian Army official 
  once said in the midst of discussions, &quot;that stories are grossly exaggerated. 
  Yesterday we went to investigate a case of alleged rape. Ultimately it turned 
  out to be only molestation&#148;.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>Our anger is at our own impotence and powerlessness. 
  We feel that our physical selves, and our womanness are under the control of 
  these marauders, who take what they want at their will and pleasure. But for 
  these men of authority, it is only a matter of mere definitions.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>Another time - in the face of mounting evidence - this 
  same official was forced to take a more conciliatory tone:</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>&quot;I agree that rape is a heinous crime. But my dear, 
  all wars have them. There are psychological reasons for them such as battle 
  fatigue.&quot; </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>A screaming rocket burst into my head. I thought to myself, 
  yes it is part of all wars; but still, we women cannot swallow it. Our bodies 
  are ours. You cannot relieve yourselves on us.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>The Indian Army made it clear to the community that they 
  were ready to act on any case of violation with severity. Once rape was established, 
  the Indian Army did take punitive measures against offenders . But its attitude 
  was one of splitting hairs on the evidence and thereby, perhaps unintentionally, 
  discouraging complainants. It was not ready to consider the threat to life and 
  limb that might have been used to suppress evidence. For example, an incident 
  connected with the rape on 18 November, concerning which people had gone on 
  a delegation to an army camp, is an eye opener. The commanding officer of the 
  camp had not only held an identification parade, but had also taken the particulars 
  of the young men of the neighbourhood who were in the forefront of the delegation. 
  A few days later some &quot;rounds&quot; were made in the vicinity of the house 
  of one of these young men. He was taken into custody and beaten very badly. 
  While beating him they were alluding to the rape saying that it was the Tigers 
  who had raped, and that the people had put the blame on the I.P.K.F.. He was 
  later released as he was innocent. Such incidents lead victims to believe that 
  the I.P.K.F. does not respond kindly to protests against rape and that threats 
  and beatings are used to suppress evidence.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>The Indian Army stands further exposed by their response 
  to the rape of the 22 year old student mentioned earlier. She had identified 
  the rapists at the army camp and she was asked to come the next day. When she 
  reported the next day with both her parents, they were all sent to the Ariyali 
  camp in a truck and were told that higher officials would see them. They waited 
  the whole day and eventually became so angry that they refused to eat anything. 
  At midnight a soldier came and said that the commander wanted to see the girl 
  alone. The mother got very angry and both the mother and daughter started raising 
  their voices in protest. Then the man put his finger on his lips and left the 
  room quickly. The mother fearing further forceful encroachment, spent the night 
  just outside the room. The following morning the family wished to go, but were 
  asked to wait again. Realising the fatality as much as the futility of waiting, 
  the young woman, with some resourcefulness, said that her mother was ill (she 
  had a bad leg) and that they had to admit her at the hospital. The army suggested 
  their own hospital. The family was so adamant, that the army asked the father 
  to wait in the camp while the mother and daughter went to Jaffna Hospital. The 
  daughter was asked to return after admitting her mother. However she got herself 
  admitted as well. She later learnt that the father walked out of the camp once 
  she and her mother had left for the hospital.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>An officer once protested:</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>&quot;We are not checking women deliberately. You see, 
  one day, when one of our officers was going on an open vehicle, there were two 
  young women on the road side. One waved while the other raised her skirt and 
  fired an automatic gun at our officer and a jawan. Don't you think we have to 
  check women? It is women who are carrying weapons strapped to their thighs and 
  in their blouses.&quot;</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>Hundreds of women at sentry points were being given total 
  body checks by men. Searching for weapons became an open licence to paw a whole 
  population of women. One adolescent was bitterly crying at one check point - 
  they had even made her show the sanitary towel she had on. Moreover, even the 
  Indian press, including the woman reporter Anita Pratap, dismissed rape as rumour 
  and called it a well orchestrated smear campaign against the I.P.K.F.. In January, 
  the Indian Army with great fanfare brought women of the C.R.P.F. to do the checking 
  of women. But this was a farce, because when impromptu checks and searches occur, 
  they do not occur in areas where women check points are conveniently placed. 
  Moreover, at Elephant Pass, a C.R.P.F. male officer was known to be inside the 
  enclosure observing the women being checked.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span></span>Furthermore, like rape, many cases 
  of molestation occurred during the so called house to house searches. At the 
  Manipay Hindu College refugee camp in late November, the Indian Army separated 
  the men from the women and proceeded to molest the girls. The women screamed 
  together and prevented further such activity.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span></span>At Passaiyoor in December, in a routine 
  house to house search by the Indian Army, they raised the skirts of the women 
  in a house. The women went on an angry delegation to the commanding officer 
  of the area, complained, and demanded decency and dignity. There was an identification 
  parade and the women identified the soldiers concerned. After that it was arranged 
  that search operations should be carried out only with a civilian observer present. 
  The molested women in this instance, were generally from a working class background, 
  particularly from the fishing community, and were far less likely to take any 
  slight to their womanhood and dignity with demureness. At Lawton Road, Manipay, 
  in December, molestation occurred, as a result of which one woman was left with 
  a split upper lip when she resisted. Another escaped the worst only by screaming 
  out loudly.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span></span>We do not say that the Indian Army 
  does not take any preventive measures. But the measures taken are very slow 
  in forthcoming and the army goes to great lengths to exonerate the alleged rapist 
  and build alibis. Little is done to alleviate the sufferings of the victims 
  and their families. Even as we are writing, information about cases of rape 
  and molestation trickle in from all over. As women, we feel the helpless anger 
  of our victimised sisters, and the pain and agony of smashed and stigmatised 
  lives. The cumulative effect of all this was a fear ridden and restricted lifestyle 
  for women. Women who stay at home are very fearful of impromptu house to house 
  searches. So they cook early and gather in one house or keep all the windows, 
  doors and gates shut. It has been a common sight in Tamil areas, especially 
  in Jaffna, for women to be mobile on bicycles - women in saris, taking children 
  to school and going to work, and young daughters with mothers on their bicycle 
  carriers. A woman said:</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>&quot;We used to do many things. Especially after the 
  operations by the Sri Lankan Army, we women had to shoulder more tasks and protect 
  our men or send them away.&quot; </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>The Sri Lankan Army had targeted a 14 to 40 year old 
  age group for their definition of a Tamil terrorist and used to round up villages 
  to arrest males from this age group. Thus life for the most able bodied section 
  of the community became precarious. Many young men left, leaving behind the 
  women, children, and the old to keep life going in their homeland. She continued, 
  </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>&quot;But now, with all these incidents of molestation, 
  and rape, we cannot go anywhere without a male escort and most of the time we 
  are forced to remain inside.&quot;</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>Though the situation in general is easing now, the ongoing 
  incidence of sexual violence against women gives impetus to the return of narrow 
  values. An older woman asked:</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>&quot;Why cannot these women be inside their homes ? 
  Look at these young girls, laughing and talking. With all this happening, they 
  still parade around! They are deliberately inviting attention.&quot; </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>Reflecting on the new surge of conservatism brought about 
  by the presence of the I.P.K.F., a younger woman said: </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>&quot;Actually we should not bring up our girls timid 
  any more - but I do agree we should not tempt these men.&quot; </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>As if to echo this, I wish to relate an interesting anecdote. 
  Girls from a village close to the university said that the Indian Army had given 
  a note to their school which the teacher read out. It said: &quot;Girls should 
  wear sarees, and should not go around on cycles&#148;. The tragedy of all this 
  is summed up by the young woman who said in a funny, poignant way: </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>&quot;At the checkpoint even if army men just brush or 
  even make a comment, the old ladies of the village would gather and gossip - 
  'Poor girl she has been spoilt, how will they get her married off.' To avoid 
  all this I shut myself inside the house.&quot;</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>Caught in such a situation, without a strong women's 
  leadership in the movements, or grass roots organisations, the community of 
  women had no path to organise along and come together so as to raise their voices 
  against such gross evils as sexual violence by the Indian Army. Thus the community 
  has left it to be handled spontaneously. And we find two clear streams of action 
  emanating.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>First, the middle class families in cases of rape and 
  molestation have always tried to hide it. They were not willing to expose the 
  culprits because they existed as individualized families and feared the censure 
  of the society around them. The only events that have been brought out have 
  been ones where the victims were ordinary people. The middle classes after having 
  all the advantages of education, and being able to have some kind of a privileged 
  relationship with the Indian Army, did not bring out the issues. Nor did they 
  organise protests, but instead they continued to side step the problem. They 
  did not think in terms of justice being done to the individual or community. 
  This portrays the anaemic character of our middle classes in whom the community 
  had reposed its power but who continually fail the people.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>Secondly, this type of handling, of the victimisation 
  of women, individualized the burden of the act carried by the woman, thereby 
  internalizing the pain and trauma and creating far reaching damage to the inner 
  life of a woman. The society stands apart and the most it does is to indulge 
  in sympathetic gossip. Depersonalizing the woman in such acts of violence could 
  be achieved through the collective consciousness. The community of women supporting 
  the victim and letting the trauma drain out, is like opening out an abscess 
  and letting the puss drain out. As a young woman of twenty enlightened me:</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>&quot;Why can they not treat it as a wound sister and 
  let it heal? The soldiers destroy once. But the village destroys us a thousand 
  times.&quot; </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>Neither have we built structures for women to come together 
  and act (despite the high flown revolutionary language floated around by the 
  women in the liberation movements). Nor have we as a class, had the courage 
  at the point of crisis to come together. The onus of carrying the burden of 
  victimization has fallen on the shoulders of the women of the labouring population 
  and on individual women of this class - a duty which they have courageously 
  under-taken. These fragments of conversation add to what we have personally 
  experienced as women in the aftermath of the war. It shows the community of 
  women made to give up a life-style of relative freedom. It shows the community 
  denuded of power and internal strength, and having to resort to the most restrictive 
  of existing social norms. Those who have taken the brunt are the most vulnerable 
  section - the women - making them totally powerless and condemning them to a 
  cloistered existence. Furthermore, no serious attempts were made at community 
  level to bring about an awareness of the problems arising from the Indian patronage 
  of liberation movements. In fact it is the liberation movements that led us 
  into such a physically interlocked relationship with India. In actual practice, 
  all movements drifted to a position of existing with Indian patronage. Therefore 
  it is not surprising that most of the women had a simple faith in India before 
  the present history ravaged their psyche. Many women we met told us that they 
  could not believe that the Indian Army could commit such base acts. These women, 
  like their men, believed not only that India came as a friend, but also in the 
  so called Indian respect and esteem for women. </span></p>

  camp the next day. She was allowed to keep it. She was questioned on the whereabouts 
  of a Tiger member. They alluded to him as her paramour and the baby as his. 
  They had put her in a pit and filled the pit up to the armpit with soil and 
  a soldier jumped on it asking for information. She felt tightening and constriction 
  on her body and chest. She told her story. She had only cooked some meals for 
  the Tigers. Later they pulled her out. She was released 5 days later.</span></p>

  pipes which are made out of plastic for piping water. The pipe was loaded with 
  sand. They said that they had full information about her and that she must tell

  first three days. She was then put in a large room with two others, a 45 year

<p style='text-align:justify;'><b>5.6 Tamil Women and the </b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><b>National Liberation Struggle </b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>A common view is often expressed regarding Sri Lankan 
  Tamil women, that they have a certain degree of freedom compared to women in 
  some South Asian societies. These sweeping generalisations point to facts ranging 
  from socio-anthropological observations such as that the Sri Lankan Tamil society 
  is matrilocal or matrilinear. Many women are educated, and have accessibility 
  to professional education and status. They are mobile, dress freely and often 
  act as bread winners. One has to examine these generalizations deeper to understand 
  the real nature of women's position in Tamil society. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>The evolution of relative freedom for women in our society 
  in comparison to other South Asian societies, is a part of the over all evolution 
  of society. Our country, unlike many other South Asian nations, is fairly well 
  penetrated by capitalist relations. This is primarily a historical development 
  that occurred because of integration with the world capitalist system. During 
  colonial rule, the plantations became the main economic activity of the island. 
  The middle classes were integrated into servicing this colonial economy and 
  administration. This pattern continued into neocolonial times with some qualifications, 
  furthering the integration into the world economy. Examples are the dependence 
  on tourism, and the development of the Free trade Zone. Therefore what is fairly 
  apparent is that, although there was no rooted capitalist mode of production, 
  the society had well established capitalist relations. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>This had removed some of the restrictions of feudal society. 
  Moreover, the fact that education became the greatest employment asset and its 
  widespread availability, made women struggle to become educated, take up careers 
  and professions and move into public life. As a result, these struggles have 
  resulted in the accommodation of women in spheres outside the family. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>However, these improved standards in practical life are 
  a facade. The inferior status of women was exemplified by lower pay for women's 
  work, dowry payment by women to men of similar status and profession, and by 
  restrictive cultural, and social practices. All these ramifications of patriarchy 
  and the oppression of women in the economy and ideology, remained fully entrenched. 
  Though colonial capitalist penetration and subsequent reforms had broken up 
  the old feudalism, the remnants of feudal structures now take up a distorted 
  form. A classic example is the dowry system amongst the Tamils. In feudal times, 
  the dowry was a method of preserving family wealth. It was the means by which 
  the ruling class consolidated its wealth and economic power. While one expects 
  the development of capitalist relations to dismantle dowry system, the contrary 
  is true in present day Jaffna society. The dowry system is embellished further, 
  and made into a market economy relationship. For example, if a family has a 
  male who is a professional, such as a doctor, engineer, accountant, or executive, 
  they would be able to sell this person as a husband to a wealthy man&#146;s 
  daughter, and get money in the form of a &quot;donation&quot;. This so called 
  donation to the man's family, at today's rates, runs into several lakhs of rupee<a
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">s</a></span><sup><span style='font-size:
9.0pt'>1</span></sup><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>. The bias towards &quot;educated&quot; 
  persons is historical. Since colonial times, education had meant upward mobility, 
  social status and accretion of wealth, either in this country or more importantly, 
  abroad. Since feudal times, the person has hardly mattered. It was kin based 
  family interests that dominated. Another phenomenon that is observable in Jaffna 
  society is that despite the acceptance of the market economy, it has not moved 
  forward ideologically. Since many of its feudal values and relationships are 
  based on patronage, the hierarchical order has remained. The middle classes 
  of Jaffna have advanced without a rooted economic base. Their mobility had depended 
  on salaried, service orientated professions where they are always subordinate, 
  and given restricted powers. Their momentum for advancement and self-expression, 
  was constrained at one point or the other. From this circumscribed position, 
  the search for and preservation of identity became primary. They could only 
  seek their identity, through power as a community, as families, as males, and 
  as heads of families, by preserving or &quot;pickling&quot; the inner core of 
  life. Thus their society seemed to be living a split life. Puritanism and repression 
  in private life seemed effectively to co-exist with materialism and integration 
  in public, and economic life. However, after a decade-long history of the freedom 
  struggle, and with major liberation movements even boasting of armed women's 
  sections, one would have expected tangible cracks in the ideology of Tamil society 
  and some liberating experience for the women. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><b>5.7 Women's Organisations</b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>The women's section in our liberation movements seem 
  to have produced minimal impact on the outside community. They did not conscientise 
  women in the community regarding women's issues springing from the consciousness 
  of our concrete conditions. They did not become catalysts for change as a section 
  in the leadership movement, pushing forward women's grass roots organisations. 
  </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>In our struggle there was a breakthrough in the community 
  when the Mothers' Front was formed. During the time of enormous crisis in the 
  mid-1980s, when the mass arrests of youth were a fact of life, it was fashioned 
  along the lines of the Plaza de Mayo mothers. The mothers of the disappeared, 
  together with other women in the community, formed a militant &quot;Mothers' 
  Front&quot;. During the period 1984-85, the front mobilised mass rallies, and 
  picketed public officials demanding the removal of military occupation and protesting 
  against arrests. Not only the spirit, but also the enormous numbers that they 
  were able to mobilise, spoke loudly of the high point to which such mass organisations, 
  especially of women, can rise. The front consisted of women from all classes. 
  It had central and village level organisations. However, in later years, with 
  the increasing hegemony of L.T.T.E. and the suppression of all democratic organisations 
  through pressure to toe the line, the front, pushed into political conformism, 
  lost its wide appeal and militancy. It became another Y.W.C.A.. Thereafter, 
  its central structure confined its activity to mere charity work. This underscored 
  the reality that a progressive consciousness would not be allowed to develop 
  at the community level. The lack of clarity in the women's sections of liberation 
  movements, made them unable to give any direction towards a broad front. This 
  weakness was only too apparent during the October war and its aftermath. At 
  this time, when urgent and pressing issues like rape, molestation, loss of life, 
  and loss of breadwinner needed organized protest, the existing women's structures, 
  be it the Mothers' Front or others, did not take any initiative. They who should 
  have come out in the open, rallying around the issues of human rights violations 
  and sexual abuse, were immobile and quiet. They did not demonstrate to the I.P.K.F. 
  or India that they would not leave unexposed the grossest violation of women, 
  and their suffering. In essence they did not show the forces that rule our destiny 
  that women are a force to contend with. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>However, the Jaffna Mothers Front did decide to fast, 
  to push for negotiations between India and the L.T.T.E.. It is admirable that 
  they showed their solidarity with their sisters in Batticaloa. However one becomes 
  skeptical when one looks at the cause for which they were fasting. We knew from 
  the past that India, the L.T.T.E. and the genocidal Sri Lankan government would 
  negotiate. We had learnt during the years of the civil war and the October war, 
  that neither the Sri Lankan nor the Indian government cared for the interests 
  of the Tamil people. Moreover, even for the Tigers the lives of the people were 
  subordinate to the narrow interests of their movement, as their conduct during 
  the October war showed. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>These developments leave the Tamils in a dangerous situation 
  that is subject to further manipulation by foreign influences. Although many 
  Tamils have been killed by militants in the past, accused of being agents of 
  the C.I.A., Mossad and so on, we have failed to see the big holes in our unprincipled 
  politics through which these influences can enter, in ostensibly benevolent 
  roles - as arms donors and even peace makers. Thus when a women's organisation 
  like the Mothers' Front, with the largest following, can only put forward dramatic 
  postures patronisingly assigned to it, it loses its vitality as a force. If 
  only it can be fully rooted amongst ordinary suffering women, mobilise their 
  militant strength and articulate their sufferings and aspirations, can it win 
  esteem and ensure that it is a force to be reckoned with. Sadly the Jaffna Mothers' 
  Front's inarticulate acceptance of women's sufferings at the hands of the I.P.K.F., 
  and, earlier, the L.T.T.E's inwardly directed violence, leaves them in a wasteland, 
  only to be used as a tool by one force and disregarded and bullied by the other. 
  </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><b>5.8 Women and Arms</b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>This is not a comprehensive 
  analysis. Nor is it an adequate one. However, we are trying to bring in a few 
  strands of thought that could only be filled out by women's own experience within 
  armed liberation movements. Whatever the experience - positive or negative - 
  one cannot deny that this is a sweeping phase in the life of the whole community 
  of women.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:
10.0pt'>One cannot but be inspired when one sees the women of the L.T.T.E., two 
  by two, in the night, with their A.K.s slung over the shoulder, patrolling the 
  entrances to Jaffna city. One cannot but admire the dedication and toughness 
  of their training, seen in the video films put out by the L.T.T.E.. One could 
  see the nationalist fervour and the romantic vision of women in arms defending 
  the nation. This becomes a great draw for other women to join the militant movements. 
  Our social set up, its restriction on creative expressions for women and the 
  evils of the dowry system, are some of the social factors that led to their 
  initial recruitment. Moreover, the political climate created by the struggle 
  in the past decade, and the increasing loss of men to state terrorism and the 
  world at large as refugees and emigrants, are some of the contributory factors 
  necessitating women's recruitment. However, it would be an over-statement to 
  say that it is the climate of &quot;liberation&quot;, the kind of literature 
  that is available, the knowledge of the experience of women in other struggles 
  from far flung corners of the world, or the rebelliousness against being kept 
  out of the centre of the struggle, that was drawing the fertile minds of young 
  women to active participation.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:
10.0pt'>Since the mid-1980s, women were being recruited into the movements - mostly 
  into the P.L.O.T.E. and the E.P.R.L.F. which had sizable numbers, and fewer 
  into the L.T.T.E.. Later on, however, there was a rapid growth in the number 
  of women in the L.T.T.E. as well. The L.T.T.E.'s women's section was called 
  the &quot;Birds of Freedom.&quot; The recruitment spur came after the Vadamaratchi 
  operations of the Sri Lankan Army and the massive arrests of men that followed. 
  The L.T.T.E. specifically targeted women; younger women who were already knocking 
  at the door to be included in the struggle were eagerly accepted.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:
10.0pt'>Though all these brought winds of change, the impact on the community 
  was nebulous. At times it even makes a negative impression. Episodes like the 
  finding of the bodies of some women of the P.L.O.T.E. cadre at Maniam Thottam, 
  made the community angry and blame the women.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:
10.0pt'>Unlike in the other groups, however, in the E.P.R.L.F., women were taking 
  a more assertive role and putting forward clear, honest political positions 
  in times of crisis. For instance, after the massacre of the T.E.L.O. cadre by 
  the L.T.T.E., the E.P.R.L.F. was the sole movement in the E.N.L.F. (the United 
  Front of the E.P.R.L.F., the E.R.O.S., the T.E.L.O. and the L.T.T.E.) that protested 
  and organised demonstrations and other protests. This campaign was led by their 
  women members. This position contrasts with that of the other members of the 
  E.N.L.F., such as the E.R.O.S. who tactically decided to keep quiet and co-exist 
  with the L.T.T.E.. Later when the E.P.R.L.F. was crushed by the L.T.T.E., many 
  E.P.R.L.F. women were beaten-up by the L.T.T.E.. One prominent member of the 
  L.T.T.E. had said while beating some women: </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&quot;What, liberation 
  for you all. Go and wait in the kitchen. That is the correct place for you.&quot; 
  </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>This attitude must 
  have percolated down to the women in the L.T.T.E.. For example, in discussions, 
  women of the L.T.T.E. have said that women should not stray too far away from 
  the roles set by the society and that women had taken arms too early. Coming 
  from a group whose total axis is militaristic, this comment seems surprising. 
  Looking at militaristic movements, brotherhood among males appears paramount 
  to them. Macho pride is one of the impetuses for heroism. This passive stand 
  taken by (or pushed on) the women of the L.T.T.E. is not surprising, especially 
  when we look at the L.T.T.E.'s history. Women at one time were considered evil 
  by the L.T.T.E. and they were said to make men loose their sense of purpose, 
  on account of which men in the movements were prohibited from having relationships 
  with women. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'>Contrary to our expectations, even the women's 
  section of the E.P.R.L.F. failed to make any impression despite their militancy 
  and remained abstract and isolated from the community. It is fairly evident 
  that it would be utopian to expect the women's sections to forge ahead with 
  clarity, given the level of their political consciousness and taking into consideration 
  the objective reality of our society, the nationalist struggle and the short 
  history of the women's sections. That is, the women's sections of none of the 
  movements were able to grasp the fundamentals of our concrete conditions, formulate 
  a theoretical framework and define practical tasks. This cannot be blamed on 
  the women themselves. Even if they had striven to achieve high ends, their expression 
  would have been curtailed, disregarded and even trampled upon. Because our society 
  is hierarchically organised and seeped in the ideology of male dominance, the 
  woman's position is shaped in every aspect - personal relationships, property 
  exchanges, work practices, and social and cultural norms - by a girdle of patriarchy. 
  If in a society like this, the dominant ideology under which the struggle is 
  organised is itself an even more narrow, revivalistic and romantic one, well 
  sprinkled with images of male heroes and male valour, and if nationalism is 
  a type of aggressive patriotism, then a concept of women's liberation would 
  be working against the inner core of such a struggle. </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:
10.0pt'>In such a situation, a call to arms for women had been based on images 
  of mythified &quot;brave and valiant mothers&quot; who justified such male pride 
  and went for wars or sent their sons, lovers and husbands to the war fronts. 
  Therefore the armed women's sections developed either in terms of &quot;use&quot; 
  as in the case of the L.T.T.E. or in a mechanical fashion, as a graft of an 
  idea borrowed from other liberation struggles as with the E.P.R.L.F.. Thus the 
  passive stand by the L.T.T.E. women can be understood, as the movement approved 
  of them exactly as their society did. The fact that the E.P.R.L.F., possessing 
  an advanced consciousness, was unable to transplant it in the community, is 
  a general phenomenon in all E.P.R.L.F. activities - in the armed struggle, the 
  mobilisation of people and the construction of people's structures, among others. 
  In every major aspect, the E.P.R.L.F. exhibited estrangement between its theory 
  and practice. Therefore neither our material reality nor our history had the 
  basis to support a fully blown women's section in the armed movements. It is 
  tragic that these women's sections themselves did not make any attempt to grasp 
  their reality; an analysis of the position of women, the crucial social issues 
  confronting them in Tamil society and women's history, would have enlightened 
  them and cleared the way to laying down the fundamental tasks and priorities. 
  </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:
10.0pt'>Apart from initial documents from all movements calling women to arms, 
  there were no explorations into the theory and practice of the women's question 
  with regard to Tamil society. This was very clear as we further went into discussion 
  with some of the &quot;Birds of Freedom&quot;. They confessed to much confusion 
  within the movement regarding the women's question. But they ultimately ended 
  the argument with an expression of faith in their leader's ability to solve 
  all problems. That is why a saddened woman activist told them: &quot;Please 
  remember, a woman's role is greater than just being a machine that carries arms.&quot;</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:
10.0pt'>Looking at the composition of the armed women cadre, the majority were 
  found to be from poor backgrounds, a small proportion from the middle classes 
  and a few with university backgrounds. The middle class girls were found, especially 
  in the case of the L.T.T.E., to be in the student political wing. For the women 
  from the poor background, theirs was a task with a sense of purpose, a way in 
  which they could lay their life down for something greater than a life of abject 
  poverty and lifelong labour. Those who came from the middle classes to the L.T.T.E., 
  especially those who joined the S.A.L.T., their student wing, were mostly city 
  schoolgirls with a narrow vision, who were guided only by sentiments of patriotism. 
  They held romantic and idealized images of the L.T.T.E., its heroes and leader.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:
10.0pt'>The influence of these women's sections on the community of women was 
  not only marginal, but at times it also reinforced old prejudices. It seems 
  such a tragedy that young women who went with dedication and determination, 
  were much maligned by society. When the L.T.T.E. was withdrawing during the 
  October war, the opinions of the community turned venomously against women. 
  As one older woman said: </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&quot;The Tigers 
  were all right till these women joined them. They have spoilt the movement and 
  the boys' dedication.&quot;</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>For them all the 
  grave mistakes of the Tigers could be easily pinned on to the small group of 
  women who had no power at all within the movement. Another professional woman 
  said in a scathing tone: </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&quot;Those days 
  when we asked these women why they joined the movement, they said that it was 
  for the sake of our land. Now where is the land? Why could these women not have 
  kept quiet? They are the ones who give all the encouragement to the men.&quot; 
  </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Such hard and cruel 
  words coming from women themselves, show the deep seated ramifications of women's 
  oppression. These as well as the commonly heard insinuation that women themselves 
  invite molestation and rape, show the trap that women have set for themselves. 
  Wherever a woman is, not only is she oppressed and made to play a subdued and 
  nonassertive role (being allowed to be assertive only within the ambit of male 
  dominance), she is also destined to take up set roles - playing to perfection 
  the emotional and sensitive roles, at once, of daughter, lover, wife and mother, 
  and providing a stable base for the man and the family to stand on. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:
10.0pt'>This lot gives her her paramount credibility. This is her identity. Moreover, 
  the society has evolved historically in such a way that she herself is made 
  to shape her belief and propagate and maintain her own oppression from generation 
  to generation within the family structure. However, it is not an easy task to 
  ascertain the extent of the permeation of women's oppression in our own Tamil 
  society and construct a proper strategy and tactics to counter it. That women 
  of this nation made an attempt at it and took the first courageous steps is 
  the positive gain of this era, although there is great bitterness surrounding 
  this period. There might be many consequences emanating from it. Many women 
  might be frustrated, bitter and angry and some might reconcile themselves with 
  mainstream life. A few might continue the old way in subordinate and peripheral 
  positions in the movements. But it would be a positive result if a few of those 
  who come out, with richness of experience and self-criticism, become a catalyst 
  for the further advancement of the position of women in this land.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:
10.0pt'>Even in the community, women have come out strong during this war. In 
  many instances of confrontation with the Indian Army, they have stood out as 
  individuals or as small groups, exposing the atrocities and violations of dignity. 
  A Brigadier has his collection of anecdotes of sharp tongued Jaffna women. On 
  the other hand it was mainly women who, in the midst of war, pleaded and argued 
  with the Tigers for life for their families and the whole nation. Again it is 
  women who have braved the guns and sat in a fast to save others in Batticaloa. 
  </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:
10.0pt'>Thus when one appraises the political bleakness that confronts this community 
  and this land, the women's history does have a triumph. There is powerlessness, 
  disappointment and disillusionment, but also hope. We have done it... a little 
  bit... <a href="#top">[Top]</a></span></p>
