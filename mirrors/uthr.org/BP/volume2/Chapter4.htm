<p align=center style='text-align:center;'><b><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>THE 
  PSYCHOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF THE INDIAN MILITARY ACTION</span></b></p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center;'><b>(Jaffna, The End Of 1987)</b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><b>4.1 Introduction</b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Throughout history, 
  the cost of war in terms of deaths, mutilation, torture, grief, destruction 
  of material resources, privation, social disorganisation and psychological trauma, 
  as been enormous and, in recent times, war has become increasingly costly and 
  ever more destructive. The continued occurrence of war, accompanied by the presence 
  of standing armies and the manufacture and stockpiling of costly weapons of 
  limitless destructive power, shows man's incompetence in solving his problems 
  in peaceful ways and his drive to struggle for power by violence and aggression. 
  Woe unto a population caught in such a war!</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:
10.0pt'>During the months of October and November, 1987, Jaffna witnessed death 
  and destruction on a scale unprecedented in its history. Military operations 
  have been going on full scale in Eastern Sri Lanka and to a limited extent in 
  the North, as part of the chronic civil war being waged in the last few years. 
  The so called Operation Liberation, in the middle of 1987 in the Vadamaratchi 
  area brought the action into the heartland of the Tamils of Sri Lanka. A similar 
  fate for the rest of the Jaffna peninsula had been in the offing and frequently 
  threatened. It is a tragic irony that it was left to the Indians who had all 
  along been championing the Tamil cause and had been looked upon as their saviours 
  and protectors, to complete this task. A comparable number of deaths has been 
  claimed by epidemics in the past but in terms of the agony, destruction, terror 
  and mayhem of complete war and the duration of continued action, the Indian 
  military action far surpassed anything Jaffna had ever experienced. In the final 
  analysis, it is perhaps the psychological trauma to the civilian population, 
  even more than the deaths, the physical hardships and destruction of property, 
  that is most poignant. Though not by any means a new or unique experience in 
  the annals of the history of war, an attempt is made here to record the psychological 
  impact of this acute war, from the perspective of a participant-observer. It 
  is based on an earlier, more detailed, clinical study, &quot;The psychological 
  sequelae to the chronic civil war in Northern Sri Lanka,&quot; during the period 
  1983 - 1987.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><b>4.2 Stress</b></p>
<b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";"Times New Roman";'><br clear=all style='page-break-before:auto;
'>
</span></b> 
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Psychodynamically 
  war is a form of severe stress that can cause, even in previously stable personalities, 
  temporary personality decompensation, leading to transient stress reaction. 
  The decompensation can be acute and sudden as in the case of an individual exposed 
  to an overwhelming experience of death and destruction; or chronic and gradual 
  as in the case of a person who has been subjected to being a refugee or living 
  under conditions of unpredictable and irregular shelling. Usually the individual 
  shows good recoverability once the stress situation is withdrawn, although in 
  some cases there is residual, permanent damage to the personality and an increased 
  vulnerability to stress. In the case of individuals who are marginally adjusted 
  to begin with, or who are predisposed to mental illness, the situational stress 
  may precipitate more serious psychopathology and neurotic or psychotic illness. 
  It is not possible to predict with absolute certainty what form the reaction 
  to stress will take in a particular individual, though the premorbid personality, 
  previous reaction patterns to stress, family history of mental illness and the 
  specific meaning and severity of stress in the unique life situation of the 
  individual are good indicators. Indeed in some, stress may lead to adaptation 
  and provide the impetus for personality development and increased stress tolerance. 
  Common symptoms of what has been called &quot;war neurosis&quot; are dejection, 
  weariness, tension, irritability, hypersensitivity, startled reaction, sleep 
  disturbance and tremors; or more specifically, anxiety, phobias and depression. 
  In clinics held at refugee camps, the majority of cases, apart from skin conditions 
  (like scabies), gastrointestinal disturbances (like diarrhoea and peptic ulcer) 
  and upper respiratory tract infections, were suffering from transient stress 
  relations, reactive depression and anxiety. They manifested somatic symptoms, 
  of which the following were common: headache, dizziness, dyspepsia, backache, 
  palpitation, chest pain, paresthesias and other multiple complaints for which 
  no obvious organic cause could be found. On questioning, symptoms of sleep disturbance, 
  irritability, dejection, loss of appetite and &quot;worries&quot; were discovered. 
  It has been found that patients from developing countries, who lack psychological 
  awareness, 'Somatise' their mental and emotional problems in terms of physical 
  complaints. This could explain the common finding of multiple bodily complaints 
  as a reaction to the chronic stress of being displaced.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:
10.0pt'>During the military operation several factors contributed to the inducement 
  of stress in the civilian population. A significant phenomenon during those 
  days was the large number of refugees. More than 75% of the civilians from affected 
  areas were displaced at one time or another, the figure reaching 100% in some 
  areas. 'Fight or flight' is the normal neurophysiological response of an organism 
  to threatening stimuli. Flight is the more common response particularly when 
  the threat is overwhelming. Chronic flight due to continuing danger leads to 
  one fleeing his home as a refugee to a safer place. The status of being a refugee 
  creates in one a feeling of homelessness and loss of traditional support, with 
  the collapse of the world one knew and the regular routine that was the framework 
  of one's daily life. Many civilians sought refuge at temples and schools as 
  advised by the Indian Army. These same temples and schools were shelled, resulting 
  in a large number of civilian deaths. It was a tragedy that even refugee camps 
  such as Kokuvil Hindu College, Chundikuli Girls' College, Jaffna Railway station, 
  Inuvil Pillayar Kovil and the Karamban Roman Catholic Church turned out to be 
  death traps. No place was safe. In some refugee centres, people were marched 
  in front of masked &quot;nodders&quot;. Some youths were shot, others were taken 
  away. At Manipay Hindu Ladies' College, women were raped. Decomposing bodies 
  were not allowed to be burnt or buried. It was reported that a mother had to 
  look on, while dogs ate her dead son a few yards away. Large numbers were confined 
  in small spaces for long periods of time, sometimes 2 to 3 days. They were without 
  food and water, with perhaps kanch<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">y</a></span><sup><span
style='font-size:9.0pt'>1</span></sup><span style='font-size:10.0pt'> in some 
  places. They had to relieve themselves within the rooms they were in. The children 
  and the old were badly affected. Appeals to the Indian Army fell on deaf ears 
  or were answered with threats of being shot.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'>As the army advanced behind them, the refugees 
  trekked over long distances seeking alternative refugee shelters. The old and 
  the disabled had to be left behind. A large number fled from one part of the 
  peninsula to another until, eventually, there was no place left. The more enterprising 
  and affluent ones fled to Singapore, the U.K., Canada, Australia, France, 
  West Germany and so on.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:
10.0pt'>The accumulated stress of leaving their homes and usual habitat was accentuated 
  by a complete disruption of normal life patterns, together with lack of food, 
  rest, medical attention and a continuing atmosphere of fear and terror. Another 
  important psychological stress the civilian population faced was the sudden 
  change of the role of the Indians. It has been found that an individual is better 
  able to cope if he understands and accepts the necessity for any particular 
  stress. The Tamils coped with the chronic civil war with the Sri Lankan Army 
  and the accompanying atrocities because they believed they were involved in 
  a legitimate struggle for their human rights. For the Tamils of Sri Lanka, the 
  tragedy of the Indian action lay in the fact that India, the source of their 
  culture and traditions, a holy place of pilgrimage, had always been held in 
  the most intimate and revered terms. When the Indian Army suddenly started treating 
  the local population as its enemy and to kill and destroy mercilessly, this 
  metamorphosis from friend and protector to aggressor and enemy was undoubtedly 
  the most shocking and psychologically traumatising factor of the whole war.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:
10.0pt'>The public was unprepared for the sudden onslaught. People had breathed 
  a sigh of relief at the coming of the Indians and even stopped keeping stocks 
  of essential item as was customary at the time of the Sri Lankan Army's activities.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:
10.0pt'>The older generation particularly found this change of role difficult 
  to accept and different psychological defence mechanisms like denial, rationalisation 
  and intellectualisation were resorted to, to cope with this changed situation. 
  Some denied that it was the Indian Army that was shelling and shooting and claimed 
  that it was probably the Sri Lankan Army, that only the militants were being 
  killed and that the civilian had nothing to worry about. Others maintained that 
  the atrocities were perpetuated by the North Indians, while the South Indians 
  were &quot;Good&quot; and trying to stop the North Indians. Still others rationalised 
  saying that this was all necessary and that we will understand only later. According 
  to them, the action would be over in a few days and then there would be permanent 
  peace.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:
10.0pt'>They continued to believe completely the psychological propaganda spewed 
  out by the Indian Radio special programs (Anpuvali and Veti Malai). They continued 
  to have faith and trust in the Indian Army, till they were confronted with the 
  stark reality of seeing their houses shelled or their friendly approaches answered 
  by a hail of bullets. And still some continued to rationalise the consequences 
  as something that happens with any army and held that we would have fared much 
  worse under Sri Lanka Army. And then there were those who looked at it intellectually. 
  For example a doctor compared it to a surgical procedure to excise a cancerous 
  growth, where a certain amount of healthy tissue also has to be removed. (Only 
  here, excessive healthy tissue was removed due to careless surgery, endangering 
  the lives of the patients, while the cancerous cells escaped, leading to widespread 
  matastasis). By these and similar &quot;explanations&quot;, people sought to 
  maintain their mental balance, their psychological homeostasis, in the face 
  of the unexpected Indian attack.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:
10.0pt'>It has been found that information facilitates adaptive reaction to stress. 
  Lack of information and breakdown in communication lead to much confusion, apprehension 
  and disorganisation. The local population had no precise information about what 
  was going on; rumours and half-truths circulated from mouth to mouth. The Indian 
  radio's 'local' programs (Anbu vali and Veti Malai) and the Eelamurasu, the 
  local newspaper, gave completely opposing versions. Each side announced victory 
  after victory with heavy casualties inflicted on the enemy. What became increasingly 
  clear was that these casualties referred to civilians and that heavy fighting 
  continued. In mid November, the Eelamurasu was silenced and the Indian radio 
  happily continued to announce the return of normality - the opening of shops, 
  offices and schools, the restoration of services etc., when in actual fact, 
  people were still afraid to walk around in their own compounds as full scale 
  military operations were still in progress. Only two months later, in January 
  1988, did civilian life really limp back to normality, once the hostility had 
  decreased.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'>Even those who could communicate in English or 
  Tamil were terse and snappy or threatening. The Indian Army was evidently not 
  interested. Everyone was the enemy. There was nothing to talk about. The civilians, 
  usually leading senior citizens, who tried holding white flags were rebuffed 
  rudely or sent scurrying be a hail of bullets above their heads. The Tellipallai 
  District Hospital was shelled heavily for two and a half hours with 67 shells 
  falling within the compound and injuring members of the staff and damaging many 
  buildings, although there was no resistance or presence of militants in or near 
  the hospital. After the shelling, a delegation of senior staff members in uniform, 
  together with ambulant patients approached the nearby camp, but were stopped 
  about 100 yards away. The sentry was seen to use the telephone and then he shouted 
  at the delegates to get back or be shot. Again on 17 October, troops, while 
  moving on the road in front fired on the hospital and on uniformed staff members. 
  Although the army moved frequently along the hospital road, no attempt was made 
  to establish communication with this big institution. The first contact was 
  made only on Nov. 11, a month later. This lack of communication led to much 
  uncertainty and helplessness in the minds of the public. They did not know what 
  was expected of them or what rules and regulations to follow.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:
10.0pt'>Most stress reactions show spontaneous recovery once the stress is withdrawn 
  as did happen when people started returning to their homes, and communication 
  and contact was established, with clearer information available. The atmosphere 
  of hostility and terror was defused beginning from January 1988. But the fact 
  that the stress had been fairly severe, was shown by the long time people took 
  to recover. The refractory period was prolonged unlike after the Sri Lankan 
  Army operations, where people resumed civil life immediately or had learned 
  to continue despite military activity. A haunting sense of shock, disbelief 
  and disillusionment, fear and terror, loss and sorrow still lingers like a bad 
  taste. The Tamil man will not easily forget this experience.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:
10.0pt'>On the positive side, some adapted well to the stress and showed hidden 
  strength and leadership qualities. Particularly encouraging was that individuals, 
  considered as trouble makers or administrative headaches during normal times, 
  acted with heroism and initiative. At the Tellipallai District Hospital, a lady 
  doctor, though with child, continued to run the hospital despite heavy shelling 
  and direct firing on the hospital and her quarters. When most of the staff had 
  fled, she stayed on with four nurses and looked after the patients for over 
  two months, doing yeoman service at this critical juncture. The local population 
  as a whole, after some initial panic and disorganisation, learnt to cope with 
  the situation for two months, while fierce battles raged on all fronts, amidst 
  exploding shells and gunfire, a continuous shoot-at-sight curfew and a breakdown 
  of all civil organisations. The usual amenities of civilized life that we had 
  been so used to, were suddenly not there. What are normally considered essential 
  requirements, such as electricity, water, mail, transport and access to main 
  roads, hospital and medical services, banking and circulation of money, jobs 
  and salaries , ceased to exist for over 2 months. People were caught unawares 
  without any stocks. Open shops were scarce. A large number of refugees were 
  on the move. The injured needed medical care. The sick and disabled, infants 
  and pregnant mothers, unfed domestic animals ... the problems were unlimited. 
  The reaction was often inspired and heart warming. People became accommodating, 
  forgot old quarrels and helped complete strangers. Refugees were given shelter 
  and food shared. People came forward to donate bags of rice, flour, milk and 
  vegetables to refugee camps, food for the infants, care for the sick, solace 
  for the grieved, and refugees were fed and clothed for long periods, thus establishing 
  new friendships. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:
10.0pt'>Small acts of heroism such as retrieving the injured and taking them to 
  hospital facing great personal danger, were much in evidence. At St. Anthony's 
  Church at Chunnakam, eleven severely injured persons were kept alive overnight 
  by a nurse and St. John's ambulance volunteers until midday when permission 
  was given by the army to the priest in charge of St. Anthony's Church to take 
  them to hospital. At Sanguveli, when some young girls were taken away by Jawans, 
  a brave, middle-aged woman approached the army camp, a very risky undertaking 
  in those shoot-at-sight days, and raised such a cry that the commanding officer 
  fired some shots into the air and the Jawans returned meekly to camp. The girls 
  escaped being raped.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:
10.0pt'>Communities organised themselves into groups to deal with urgent issues. 
  Enterprising shopkeepers kept the interior areas supplied with essential items 
  at reasonable prices, often taking risks to procure items from neighbouring 
  areas. But as a whole, the community managed to withstand the severe pressure 
  for over two months, completely on their own, with no outside help. They have 
  established their self reliance, self-sufficiency and their ability to live 
  off the land without the modern amenities of civilization. They have lived up 
  to the local palmyrah tradition.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><b>4.3 Anxiety</b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Phobic anxiety is 
  basically the psychological component of a fear reaction that has become incapacitating. 
  Fear was the predominant emotion during this time and phobic anxiety states 
  could be considered almost normal under the circumstances. They usually reported 
  intense apprehension, fear, feeling of impending doom or death, tension, being 
  edgy, irritable, vigilant and easily startled, dyspnoea, palpitation, chest 
  pain, choking sensation, sweating, abdominal pain, loose motions and increased 
  micturation. Some reported frequent panic attacks, particularly during shelling, 
  gunfire or on seeing the army. Children were reported to run and cling on to 
  their parents or hide under beds. Many had sleep disturbances like difficulty 
  in falling asleep, interrupted sleep, anxiety dreams where they see themselves 
  being injured or chased by the army, nightmares and fitful sleep, with fatigue 
  on awakening. Patients with a previous history of angina pectoris, developed 
  anginal pain during these attacks. It was observed that some instinctively resorted 
  to repeating mantras or short prayers which have been shown to work as relaxation 
  techniques to alleviate anxiety.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:
10.0pt'>What has been described as existential anxiety was also observable in 
  some cases. Deaths became a pressing reality and people had to deal with that 
  fear daily. What had been quietly forgotten or submerged in the press and care 
  of daily life, broke into one's awareness, Man was made aware of his existential 
  state, the transience of life that everything born must die one day. As death 
  stalked the land, the veil that separated life form death was rent asunder and 
  one stood face to face with stark reality. An existential fear gripped everyone. 
  An old, experienced man compared the present war to the great destructive forces 
  of nature - famine, epidemics, cyclones... Groping for mythical symbols to express 
  his deep feeling, he said: &quot;Mother Kali with her Asura forces from India 
  have descended on Jaffna!&quot;</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:
10.0pt'>Terror, a form of extreme fear, was widely prevalent in the months of 
  October and November. This was not surprising since it was quite evident that 
  there was a deliberate attempt at the time to terrorise the civilian population. 
  The usual uniformity in the behaviour of the Jawans towards the civilians lends 
  support to this assertion. As mentioned earlier, there was no attempt to establish 
  communication or contact with the civilians; rather it was actively discouraged. 
  Where there was conversation, usually during search operations, it was terse, 
  snappy and revealingly similar. &quot;Any sound from this direction and we will 
  flatten your house and shoot you all.&quot; This was repeated in different situations, 
  in different places, by different Jawans. Was this a standard order from higher-up? 
  This wall of silence, except for the few belligerent words spoken, caused uncertainty, 
  a feeling of isolation and loneliness, made worse by being cut off from the 
  outside world.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:
10.0pt'>Secondly the Jawans were undoubtedly free to do as they wished. By their 
  words and deeds, the they conveyed the message that they had been given a free 
  hand by the higher-ups. They were not accountable and people felt deserted, 
  alone, without protection and without recourse to justice. An Indian Red Cross 
  doctor told me that this could only have happened here. There was nothing to 
  ask. This never happened in Punjab or or in Bangladesh. The army felt free to 
  destroy, kill, loot, rape... They were allowed to run amok, unchecked for nearly 
  two months. This lack of restraint, the liberty to do as they wished, contributed 
  to the atmosphere of terror. The atmosphere changed gradually from December 
  as the commanders started to apply some constraints, making the Jawans accountable 
  for their actions and took action on complaints. This did ease the situation 
  somewhat and the Jawans showed much more restraint in their behaviour. A third 
  factor contributing to the reign of terror was the inhuman behaviour of the 
  army. The local population was pushed, shoved and beaten with extreme callousness 
  and brutality. Status, age, sex,.... nothing mattered. Lawyers, doctors, engineers; 
  the old, the young; and the sick and the disabled were all shot even after being 
  identified; whole families were pulled out of their houses and shot. The bloody 
  assault on the Jaffna hospital with the massacre of doctors, nurses and patients, 
  described in detail elsewhere, was the epitome of this type of barbarous behaviour 
  that struck terror in the hearts of the people.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:
10.0pt'>Fourthly the indiscriminate shelling, particularly the its unpredictability 
  and terrific noise, were instruments of psychological terror. It is questionable 
  whether the intense shelling of whole areas achieved any military objective. 
  There were at the most only a few thousand militants among 800,000 civilians 
  in Jaffna, whereas the Indians went about it as if it was conventional war against 
  a large army. One wondered how many of the militants were actually hit by any 
  one of the thousands of shells that fell on Jaffna. As for its psychological 
  effect, the militants could be observed to be nonchalantly moving around in 
  casual conversation, quite unalarmed by the exploding shells.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:
10.0pt'>But the persistent shelling of densely populated areas, even after large 
  scale resistance and mortar shelling ceased, speaks of a more sinister purpose. 
  Sixty shells fell on the Tellipallai hospital on 12 October, when no militants 
  were around. The Christa Seva Ashram with well over a thousand refugees was 
  heavily shelled on 13 October, with a part of the chapel roof collapsing on 
  the incumbent. Again no militants were around. In addition there was the so 
  called &quot;noise&quot; shell which exploded with a thunder-clap effect. This 
  was obviously a psychological weapon used with deadly effect on the civilians. 
  Nights were spent in abject terror, partly due to what has been called the anticipatory 
  anxiety of not knowing when and where a shell would fall. Some died of psychological 
  shock. A mother who had delivered her second child, died suddenly when Chankanai 
  was shelled. Many children have never got over the effect of the noise and remain 
  hypersensitive to any loud noise. Two children who had gone to Colombo as refugees 
  developed severe anxiety and clung to there parents when fire-crackers were 
  lit for the New Year. The animal population too suffered terribly from the noise 
  pollution. Trembling dogs were seen scampering all over, rabbits dropped dead 
  and wild birds vanished from the Jaffna Peninsula. The cry of despair that escaped 
  from an old man in late November reflected the anguish of all living things: 
  &quot;When will this infernal noise stop? When will the shooting cease? Oh, 
  when will peace return to this land?&quot;</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:
10.0pt'>Another devastating aspect of the shells was the destruction of property 
  and mutilation of civilians. Residents at Inuvil hospital heard a shell whiz 
  past overhead and in a few moments a Professor Chandrasekaran of Jaffna University 
  was carried over the hospital boundary wall with both legs gone and bleeding 
  profusely. That image was to recur in their minds and send them into panic whenever 
  they heard shells. One has to concede to the credit of the Indians, that neither 
  heavy artillery nor the more lethal fragmenting shells favoured by the Sri Lankan 
  Army was used and heavy bombing was not resorted to. But there was no need at 
  all for artillery fire on a civilian population.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:
10.0pt'>A questionable feature of the heavy destruction due to shelling was that 
  it fell short of Jaffna. There is severe destruction on all roads leading to 
  Jaffna, but stopping just short of the city limits. There was stiff resistance 
  to the army in Jaffna and many civilian deaths but not much destruction of buildings. 
  One wonders why. Could it be the Indians wanted to preserve Jaffna? But subsequent 
  events such as their hurry to establish normality within the Jaffna Town suggest 
  that they wanted the town intact and whole for their conducted tours for foreign 
  journalists. If this is true, then it shows a degree of pre-planning and a deliberate 
  use of the artillery for nonmilitary purposes.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:
10.0pt'>The decision to use terror may have been to wrest control over the civilian 
  population and force them to relinquish their sympathy and support for the L.T.T.E.. 
  Perhaps due to their failure to win a quick victory and their gross underestimation 
  of the L.T.T.E., the Indian Army found itself fighting a desperate battle to 
  save face and take Jaffna at all costs. A second possible reason may have been 
  a reaction to the fighting tactics of the L.T.T.E.'s guerrilla warfare in an 
  urban setting. The civilian population was used for cover. They fought from 
  hospitals, temples and schools. Women and children performed military tasks 
  and allegedly dead bodes were desecrated. These may not have been the norms 
  of war, the Dharma, that the Indian Army expected. If one is to rationalize 
  the behaviour of the Jawans at all, it must be in the context of their being 
  psychologically unprepared for this type of battle and as a rage reaction to 
  the way it was fought.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span></span> It has been reported that some 
  sodiers were airlifted over long distances and immediately pressed into battle 
  without adequate rest. Others came with only a change of clothes expecting the 
  action to be a pushover and to be completed in a few days. They were handicapped 
  by fighting an elusive enemy using guerrilla tactics, along with rigid conventional 
  lines, resulting in heavy casualties. For example, at Uduvil on Oct. 13, a convoy 
  of tanks was ambushed by a handful of teenage militants. It was observable that 
  the army kept to the main road or ventured at the most into the road-side houses 
  and compounds leaving the few militants free to move around in the interior, 
  three or four houses deep from the road and in the fields. While setting themselves 
  up as easy targets from all directions, the army allowed the militants to literally 
  run in circles around them. Apparently they had been ordered to take and hold 
  on to the main roads and its main junctions. Indeed, there does not seem to 
  have been any direct fighting during the whole war except at the University 
  grounds and Urumpirai. Few in the Indian Army had any knowledge of the political 
  situation. Put in a completely foreign environment and ignorant of the local 
  language and customs, they may have undergone a paranoid reaction. They were 
  suspicious of everyone, treating the whole local population as the enemy actively 
  supporting the L.T.T.E..</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:
10.0pt'>&quot;You L.T.T.E.? ... Where L.T.T.E.?&quot; ... L.T.T.E., L.T.T.E. ...was 
  the one word on their lips. It became an obsession with them. There may have 
  been also an element of inexperience and over-reaction to the situation in some 
  units. It was observable that guns and shells were fired with wild abandon, 
  continually for long periods with little or no provocation. Sometimes one got 
  the impression that they were indulging in using the weapons for the sheer pleasure 
  or experience of it. Late in the night one would hear a shot and then a whole 
  barrage in answer, that would go on and on, and then a few shells for good measure. 
  These men had been pressed into battle mentally unprepared. Expecting a quick 
  finish, but meeting fierce resistance in a foreign environment, they reacted 
  with an uncontrolled frenzy. Later on, a soldier tried to explain their behaviour 
  by saying: &quot;When one of us dies, our blood begins to boil and we do not 
  know what we are doing.&quot; But in enlisting in the army, they should have 
  expected battle and death and not taken it out on the civilian population when 
  faced with such grim realities. It may be said that an army is an army and as 
  armies go, they were no worse. But then, we expected something better from India.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:
10.0pt'>In the final analysis, the ultimate responsibility for what ensued, rests 
  with the higher command and more with the political administrators in New Delhi 
  and their representative in Colombo for putting their men in a difficult situation. 
  It was a situation largely of their own making.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:
10.0pt'>The use of terror may have worked to some extent on a society that has 
  learned the language of violence and was used to being ruled by terror. But 
  to continue to rule by the use of terror is costly and impracticable and the 
  Indians have realised this as evidenced by their current efforts to win the 
  hearts and minds of the Tamil by more humane methods. Their recent (February 
  1988) search operations in Batticaloa were carried out with much more restraint 
  and consideration for the civilians.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:
10.0pt'>The terror of those days still lingers like a persistent bad taste, a 
  recurrent nightmare. The Jaffna man is unlikely to forget that experience in 
  a hurry as can be seen by his lukewarm responses to friendly overtures of army 
  personnel. After all, friendship is not something that can be turned on and 
  off like a switch.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><b>4.4 Grief Reactions</b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Grief reactions 
  were common during this period. Due to the suddenness and the psychologically 
  traumatising circumstances surrounding the death of loved ones (such as the 
  noise and destruction, the blood, mutilating injuries, pain, lack of medical 
  attention and standing helpless as loved ones died) there was an increased incidence 
  of the more severe reactions and several with atypical features.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:
10.0pt'>A middle aged engineer whose 3 children and mother-in-law had been pulled 
  out of their home and shot dead on the street for no apparent reason, developed 
  a severe grief reaction with secondary alcoholism. He spent his days in deep 
  sorrow with attacks of crying spells, the pangs of grief buffeting him like 
  waves. His mind was preoccupied with thoughts of his children. He complained 
  of loss of purpose in life with suicidal ruminations. His nights were particularly 
  bad with recurrent nightmares about his children and their suffering, especially 
  his pretty daughter. The soldier had lifted up her frock and shot her through 
  the groin. She could not walk and had to drag herself along the road and finally 
  bled to death for lack of adequate medical attention. This picture kept recurring 
  in his mind. He would say: &quot;She was deeply loved and I brought her up without 
  a care. And now she had to suffer like this... It is unbearable,&quot; and break 
  into sobs. Hostility, a feature typical of grief reaction, was apparent in his 
  accusations of medical mismanagement, wanting revenge (&quot;I'll personally 
  kill these soldiers,&quot;) and his filing a case. His wife too was inconsolable 
  and he expressed a fear that she would cry herself to death. They felt that 
  without their children, life had lost its meaning. Previously an occasional 
  drinker, he had now started drinking heavily and was in a state of intoxication 
  most of the day and night.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:
10.0pt'>A 24 year old farmer from Alaveddy developed an atypical grief reaction 
  when his father and uncle were shot while attending to their cows. He became 
  restless with irrational and incoherent speech and behaved in an abnormal and 
  bizarre way. The picture was that of a psychotic reaction and required electroconvulsion 
  therapy.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:
10.0pt'>In some cases, multiple deaths of close relations precipitated decompensation. 
  A nurse, previously of a jovial personality, developed a severe depressive illness 
  when several of her close relations died. She needed intensive treatment before 
  she gradually recovered.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><b>4.5 Reactive Depression</b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>A large number of 
  patients with depression secondary to the current situation presented to the 
  out-patient clinic and for in-ward treatment. The reactive type of depression 
  is known to be brought on by any type of loss. In addition to the grief reactions, 
  some of which merged into true depressive illness due to loss of loved ones, 
  the other common causes for the development of the illness were loss of house 
  and property due to shelling, loss of employment and other sources of income, 
  loss of dignity and humiliation due to arrest and/or assault and loss of virginity 
  and chastity due to rape.In some cases, wives presented with reactive depression 
  when their husbands were taken in for questioning and assaulted. Conversely, 
  husbands developed loss of libido and other depressive features when their wives 
  were raped.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:
10.0pt'>An Indian Army doctor speaking to me soon after his arrival following 
  the July '87 peace accord, expressed his shock and sorrow at seeing so many 
  houses destroyed. His camp was near Kurumbasiddy, where most houses had been 
  destroyed by the Sri Lankan Army. I agreed, saying that it was built with their 
  life-earnings. To this he replied: &quot;It is not merely the money, it is the 
  love and affection with which they would have built and maintained their homes. 
  To see all that destroyed must be heart rending.&quot; I do not know whether 
  he was here to see what happened in October and November and whether he would 
  still be sympathetic. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:
10.0pt'>The straw that broke the camel's back, the loss that proved to be just 
  too much to bear after seeing their houses damaged or destroyed, that which 
  tipped the scale into full blown depressive illness, was the loss of their personal 
  belongings due to looting by the locals. A very unfortunate outcome of the prevailing 
  situation, a state of anarchy without law or order, was the widespread looting 
  that went unchecked. Those vulnerable, those most affected, were the ones who 
  had already suffered much. It was a sad reflection on our community.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><b>4.6 Psychosomatic Disorders</b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Psychological stress 
  is known to cause physical disorders like eczema, backaches, headaches, bronchial 
  asthma, hypertension, peptic ulcer and mucous colitis. Disorders of this nature 
  were very common during the current period, particularly dyspepsia, tension 
  headaches, backaches, hyperventilation and tachycardia. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:
10.0pt'>In some cases the psychological stress led to more lethal consequences. 
  Psychologically stressful life events are known to precipitate myocardial infection. 
  A middle aged telephone operator at Tellipallai hospital who had been quite 
  healthy, suddenly developed chest discomfort and died when his teenage children 
  were taken in for questioning. A known hypertensive who had been doing quite 
  well had a stroke and died when his area came under intense shelling.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:
10.0pt'>In contrast, some of our patients who had been chronically ill with arthritis, 
  backache and dyspnoea and some of hypochondriacal nature, appeared to get better 
  during this period of stress and led a healthy life even without medication. 
  The complaints returned with the easing of the situation.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><b>4.7 Personality Disorders</b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>It has been found 
  that individuals with abnormal personalities tend to join extreme organisations. 
  Delinquents, aggressive and anti-social personalities may do well in a military 
  set-up, where their energies can be diverted to national ends and their confinement 
  in the army be a protection for the society.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:
10.0pt'>It is a well established fact that war provides ample opportunity for 
  sadistic personalities to derive pleasure from acts of violence, cruelty and 
  torture on hapless victims. When the dogs of war were unleashed on Jaffna, one 
  got the impression that a band of raving psychopaths had been let loose on the 
  public. Strangely enough, after the cessation of military activities, the Jawans 
  appeared to be a bunch of innocuous human beings, with the normal variety of 
  personality traits and personal problems. It may be that the war machine itself 
  brings out the darker aspects of one's personality and engenders behaviour bordering 
  on the barbarous, which under normal conditions remained suppressed. To some 
  extent this may have been due to the releasing of the usual restraints and discipline 
  by the higher command. This was quite clear in the behaviour of the Jawans. 
  They acted without any remorse and showed no fear of any disciplinary action 
  from the commanding officers. In fact they indicated that they had been given 
  a free hand. This picture improved by December and more so by the beginning 
  of 1988. By January 1988 the Jawans were much more disciplined and polite and 
  showed fear and uneasiness when indulging in anti-social or illegal activities. 
  By now disciplinary action had been instituted. Identification parades were 
  held and punishment meted out. It is interesting to note that the worst punishment 
  from the point of view of the Jawans, was to be deported home without salary 
  and their pension withdrawn. It is just possible that the officers had been 
  hard put to control the troops after the initial reverses, the heavy casualties 
  and the dirty, &quot;Adharmic&quot; war that erupted. In an attempt to maintain 
  troop morale and retain some control, they may have allowed these indulgences. 
  Indeed the officers themselves, with a few exceptions, were very indignant and 
  belligerent during the actual war. The Indians were quick to realise quite early 
  in the struggle, perhaps to the advantage of the local people, that it is easy 
  to take, but difficult to hold onto an occupied land as shown in Vietnam and 
  Afghanistan. They need the co-operation of the people. Thus the battle for the 
  hearts and minds of the Jaffna men was launched; discipline and order were established, 
  regular classes on public relations were held for the troops, rehabilitation 
  and reconstruction work was commenced, and the popular medical clinics and food 
  distribution were started in every village.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:
10.0pt'>Once the tension eased, one got more insight into the personalities of 
  the officers. As the Jawans started mixing with the public, one perceived the 
  more human side of their character. Despite their metamorphosis during the war, 
  they revealed a simple personality with problems that only the less sophisticated 
  in extended family relationships will take seriously. They lived simply and 
  had simple tastes, likes and dislikes. While in battle they had shown indomitable 
  courage and a remarkable endurance. Another noticeable feature of their character, 
  perhaps not surprising considering their Indian origin, was their extreme religiosity, 
  at least externally. Vibuthis, pottus, pictures and flowers on vehicles, worship 
  and respect at temple were very much in evidence.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:
10.0pt'>At times this took on a tragi-comic aspect, as when a soldier riding on 
  top of a tank that had repeatedly fired on and severely damaged the Christa 
  Seva Ashram and the attached Seminary, folded his hands and bowed his head in 
  prayer as he passed the cross at the entrance! Much more touching were the innocent 
  love affairs that sprang up, despite the language barrier, some even progressing 
  to more permanent relationships. One got a glimpse into their background from 
  the small things they 'lifted' while searching and their expression of awe at 
  the prosperity of Jaffna by such exclamations as: &quot;What do you lack? Everything 
  has been given to you!&quot; (They hardly realised that all that they saw had 
  been earned and built by sweat and toil off a hard and dry land). Evidently 
  they came from the poverty ridden villages of India and the army was an opportunity 
  for their families' advancement. But this did not detract from their straight 
  forwardness and a down-to-earth outlook and an occasional kind word for the 
  locals. When a young farmer in a frustrated outburst shouted: &quot;You beggars 
  you come and occupy our land which we have struggled to develop and order us 
  about and destroy every thing,&quot; the soldier merely patted him on the back 
  and said, &quot;I ... I understand, but don't repeat to others.&quot;</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:
10.0pt'>In contrast, the officers were very sophisticated, polished and suave. 
  The army hierarchy appears to have bred an elite, true to form. They spoke good 
  English with a typical accent, and were all-Indian in out-look, athletic in 
  build and extroverted and social. Their personalities impressed and easily won 
  over the leading local citizens. They appeared well disciplined and in complete 
  control of the men. It was evident that the Indian Army was a historical institution 
  with a long tradition behind it.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:
10.0pt'>The officers made excellent public relations officers when they wanted 
  to. Their main aim in dealing with the public was to reassure with flowery promises 
  that &quot;&quot;everything will be attended to, there will be no problems. 
  It is all a minor matter. Very soon there will be normality and peace. The only 
  problem is the L.T.T.E., please advise them,&quot; and so on. An Indian Red 
  Cross doctor complaining of the army's inefficiency said they will promise anything: 
  &quot;Yes, we will get it down form India tomorrow. Don't worry Doctor. No problem.&quot; 
  But nothing whatsoever will be done. One got the impression that it was all 
  a show and bluff which had a deep contempt and animosity for the public whose 
  co-operation they nevertheless needed to run the place; an arrogance that broke 
  through the veneer at the slightest frustration. This attitude may have been 
  responsible for the disagreements that arose between the military, the Indian 
  civil administration and Red Cross in Jaffna.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:
10.0pt'>There were exceptions. Major Paramesvaran showed genuine concern for the 
  plight of the civilians and initiated steps towards solving problems. Unfortunately 
  for the Jaffna man, he chose (bravely or brashly) to lead his men into battle 
  and paid the price. His loss was deeply felt by the local population who had 
  come to place their trust and faith in him. One may say of him that despite 
  his army background, he was a genuine person.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><b>4.8 Torture</b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>In the brief period 
  the Indian Army has been in Jaffna, it appears that they have not as yet adopted 
  the more psychologically damaging methods of torture. Thus we do not see the 
  degree of psychological sophistication and the prolonged systematised torture 
  of victims resorted to by the Sri Lankan security forces, sometimes for no apparent 
  purpose, which resulted in short term and long term neuropsychological symptoms. 
  Torture by the Indian Army has tended to be short term with the specific purpose 
  of gaining information. Although physical damage was sometimes severe such as 
  fractures and even death, psychological sequelae was not common. For example, 
  a foreman at the Paranthan Chemical Factory was taken in due to mistaken identity 
  and tortured by being hung by the legs and beaten on the soles and back. Electrical 
  current was passed into the sensitive tongue and penis causing severe burns 
  and the burning end of a cigarette applied to the atma. On his identity being 
  established the next day, he was released. Despite severe physical damage, he 
  did not appear to have any psychological sequelae. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:
10.0pt'>In contrast, an engineer going to Peradeniya who was taken in by the Sri 
  Lankan Army about the same time, was tortured systematically for a prolonged 
  period by methods including the regular passage of current through his head. 
  Though physical damage was minimal, he suffered a complete psychological breakdown 
  and was admitted to the psychiatric ward muttering irrationally and irrelevantly, 
  a mental wreck.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><b>4.9 Rape</b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>What is said about 
  violence in general is applicable to sexual violence. However sexual behaviour 
  has its own unique characteristics. From time immemorial, plunder and rape have 
  been considered the spoils of war. Although the total number of rapes during 
  the Indian Army operation have been exaggerated in the press, it has been verified 
  that quite a large number, ranging from young girls who had just attained age 
  to old women well past their menopause were actually raped.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:
10.0pt'>In our cultural setting, sexual violence takes on a more serious significance 
  and has a severely psychologically traumatising effect on the victim and her 
  close relations, including her husband. Chastity is traditionally considered 
  one of the supreme virtues of women, to be safe guarded with the same diligence 
  as their life. The screams and pleading of a young, attractive girl, whom three 
  soldiers were trying to rape at gun point, still echoes in my ears. She fell 
  at their feet and begged: &quot;Please brother, shoot me, but don't do this...&quot; 
  Fortunately for her, her pleading got through to an officer who took pity and 
  let her go, after slapping her. A young rape victim in Thirunelvely attempted 
  to commit suicide by jumping into a well.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:
10.0pt'>Loss of virginity in a young girl, even if against her will, meant that 
  she could not aspire to marriage in our society and, if already married, there 
  is a good chance that she will be abandoned. All rape victims are socially ostracised, 
  often by the family also. It is not surprising that rape victims were not forthcoming 
  in reporting such incidents and usually swallowed the suffering and injury silently.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:
10.0pt'>Indeed this cultural milieu was quite familiar to the Indians and they 
  took advantage of this silence and fear. In one case a girl had been taken in 
  on suspicion because she had been in a school group-photograph with a known 
  militant and been threatened by the captain with rape, assault, etc. (Perhaps 
  the captain probably meant it only as a threat). Later, when she was released, 
  a couple of Jawans had followed the family to their home, separated the parents 
  and raped the girl. As she had started bleeding after the first had deflowered 
  her, they had left saying they would come back the next day at the same time 
  and that she should be in. It is worthy of note that in two cases where the 
  victims braved both social ostracism and army intimidation to complain, the 
  Indian investigating the case made out that the victims had to have some militant 
  connection to be so bold as to complain. Although there was lack of action initially 
  by the commanders, probably because they had to maintain troop morale in a difficult 
  situation during the first two months, in later incidents disciplinary action 
  was taken with identification parades and punishment, usually in the form of 
  public thrashing and transfer to another unit. After December the Jawans were 
  more discrete and circumspect. By 1988, the higher authorities showed much sensitivity 
  on the issue of rape, probably due to the wide publicity outside Jaffna. They 
  even brought in police-women and paramilitary women to allay the fear of the 
  local women.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:
10.0pt'>The psychological impact on the rape victim and her immediate family is 
  quite severe. Initially, there is a period of shock lasting from a few hours 
  to a day or two during which she is unable to speak and is choking and gasping; 
  later a deep depression sets in with withdrawal, quietness and crying. Usually 
  the incident leaves a permanent scar and she may be unable to rejoin the mainstream 
  of social life. Two girls who later escaped to Colombo, continue to be depressed 
  and dread the thought of returning home. The fear of pregnancy drove many to 
  seek treatment, the mother or some relation insisting on positive assurance 
  of non-pregnancy or requesting an abortion or D. &amp; C., to be sure.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:
10.0pt'>These incidents of rape, the lack of protection for women, and the rumours 
  that spread, created a great fear among the women of Jaffna. The threat to womankind 
  was very real in the months of October and November. Most women experienced 
  sexual anxiety and felt exposed and vulnerable. Many fled to areas they felt 
  were safe, a large exodus reaching Colombo in December when transport became 
  available. Those left behind, started acting with circumspection by following 
  the well meant advice of sympathetic, Tamil speaking Jawans - wearing sarees, 
  putting poddus and staying indoors. It would appear that the Jaffna woman was 
  perceived as more &quot;liberated&quot; and provocative vis-a-vis her Indian 
  counterpart. Further, some of the women took it upon themselves, in a critical 
  situation, to approach and be friendly and to establish communications when 
  the men were rebuffed, assaulted or shot. This may have been misunderstood. 
  </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:
10.0pt'>The public outcry and the wide publicity of this aspect of the Indian 
  occupation that gained momentum from December reflected the deep rooted feeling 
  of insecurity and the cultural significance of this threat to our women. A young 
  lady who had fled to Colombo, confessed that when, on her return to Jaffna in 
  January, she saw the Indian Army all over the place, a fear clutched at her 
  heart and her immediate instinct was to get back to Colombo by the same bus. 
  But she sensed, as only a woman can, that the men were now different, better 
  behaved, and more disciplined.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><b>4.10 Psychosis</b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Environmental stress 
  by itself is generally not sufficient to cause the major psychiatric illness 
  called psychosis. But in a predisposed or vulnerable individual, stress may 
  precipitate a psychotic illness or cause a relapse in a healthy individual who 
  has had an attack earlier.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:
10.0pt'>Due to the prevailing situation the psychiatric services did not function 
  for over 2 months, except for the few patients who &quot;got caught&quot; in 
  the psychiatric ward at Tellipallai when the situation suddenly erupted on 10 
  October. Consequent to the heavy shelling of the Tellipallai Hospital, many 
  patients took flight from the ward. Of these, two are believed to have been 
  shot dead and one who was shot through the thigh and external genitals, was 
  brought back to the hospital for treatment. Many patients on long term maintenance 
  treatment from out-patient clinics relapsed due to lack of drugs as evidenced 
  by the large number of relapsed patients now coming for treatment. A middle 
  aged lady who had been doing well for over a year without drugs, had a relapse 
  when the barrel of a gun was thrust into her mouth. From that time she became 
  restless and paranoid. For some it was the death of a close relation that caused 
  the stress.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:
10.0pt'>During this period, many of our patients faced special hardships that 
  the mentally ill are normally not exposed to. A very attractive young girl developed 
  a florid schizophrenic illness and was taken in while wandering due to restless 
  behaviour. The truck she was being transported in was blown up by a landmine 
  and she suffered head injury. She was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit at 
  the Teaching hospital, Jaffna which was under army guard. While there, she had 
  been taken to the nurses' changing room, threatened into submission and gang 
  raped on four successive nights. Later she was taken to the K.K.S camp where 
  she was reported to have been raped again. She had jumped from a high window 
  and was readmitted to the Jaffna Hospital. While warded in the neurosurgical 
  ward she had been repeatedly raped, by being taken to the toilet. She was later 
  admitted to the psychiatric ward in a very disturbed state. Due to her mental 
  condition, she manifested an increased libido, and this symptom of her illness 
  may have been misinterpreted by the Jawans.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:
10.0pt'>Some psychotic patients behaved in abnormal and suspicious ways, others 
  wandered around during curfew hours and were taken in or shot. A young patient 
  had been taken in while coming to collect his drugs at the O.A.D. clinic. He 
  was given the so called &quot;helicopter treatment&quot; by being hung by the 
  thumbs and beaten. He was sent to us three days later when, eventually, it was 
  realised that something was mentally wrong with him. To report an incident with 
  a more humorous twist to it, a schizophrenic patient who had earlier been warded 
  at the psychiatric ward, was taken in on suspicion. He had promised to show 
  the Indian Army some L.T.T.E. members. The jubilant army unit, in a convoy of 
  jeeps and trucks was brought by the patient straight to the psychiatric ward! 
  The whole area was cordoned off and security measures taken. The patient then 
  proceeded to point to four patients warded there and said: &quot;He robbed the 
  Durghi Amman Temple; he is a top L.T.T.E. leader etc., etc..&quot; When the 
  psychiatric ward staff tried to explain that he was a mental patient probably 
  acting under a delusion, the commander had indignantly replied: &quot;He was 
  talking quite rationally, how can he be mad?&quot; They finally calmed down 
  and left, leaving instructions to keep the four who had been pointed out, under 
  confinement with no visitors or food, as cyanide capsules may be sneaked in 
  with the food. The staff would be responsible if they escaped, they added.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:
10.0pt'>Interestingly for some psychotic patients who had been handicapped by 
  chronic illness, the period of stress appeared to be therapeutic, similar in 
  effect to shock treatment leading to normal behaviour. There was a young engineer 
  who had become apathetic and withdrawn and was at the time unemployed. He had 
  attempted suicide twice, in deep depression. His area was the scene of heightened 
  military activity with many deaths, refugees and so on. He responded by becoming 
  quite energetic and helpful and undertook a variety of social tasks, even at 
  risk to his life. His relations commented that he was quite normal for the first 
  time in years.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><b>4.11 Childhood Disorders</b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Children under duress 
  commonly present disturbances in physical function (such as enuresis, functional 
  diarrhoea), emotion (such as crying spells, withdrawal) or behaviour (such as 
  clinging, temper tantrums). </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:
10.0pt'>A dental surgeon's eleven month old son developed a chronic diarrhoea 
  which did not respond to the usual medications. Their home had come under heavy 
  shelling and they had fled from place to place as shelling and gunfire started 
  wherever they stayed. The diarrhoea would stop and start again. This continued 
  for 2 months. It suddenly stopped spontaneously when the family returned to 
  their home after some normality and quiet had been established.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:
10.0pt'>Disturbance in sleep with nightmares and night terrors were widely prevalent 
  following traumatic incidents. The relieving of traumatic experience in dreams 
  may serve as a natural abreactive process whereby the child is able to work 
  through and come to terms with the traumatic experience by repeated exposure, 
  which he is unable to cope with awake. Children were found to wake up screaming 
  in the night, drenched in sweat. Parents had to stay with a child when he fell 
  asleep and be by his side whenever he awakened. A doctor's four year old girl 
  who had been sleeping by herself before, now breaks into a panic if her parents 
  are missing when she awakes. She puts out her hand and feels reassured if they 
  are there to her touch.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:
10.0pt'>All children were not uniformly affected by the stress. It was noticed 
  that after showing some initial fear and clinging behaviour due to exploding 
  shells and rattle of machine guns, some were quite undisturbed and took things 
  in their stride. At refugee camps, children were found to be playing, making 
  a big noise and enjoying themselves, despite all the tension the adults were 
  going through. Others reacted badly, showing anxiety and other emotional disturbances 
  even after things had settled down or the family had moved to a safer place 
  such as Colombo. To some extent the child's reaction was dependent on the severity 
  of stress gone through and on the reactions of the parents. Children of parents 
  who were tense and anxious showed anxiety and fear. Although children may show 
  transient behavioural and emotional disturbance under stress, the more permanent 
  effect on the developing personality of the child is difficult to assess. Studies 
  of children born under war conditions or children of parents who survived concentration 
  camp, show permanent scarring. It is likely that exposure during their formative 
  years to insecurity, homelessness and the violent death of loved ones, as well 
  as to other cruel and aggressive action and to the full paraphernalia of war 
  with its instruments of destruction, will permanently influence their development. 
  Indications of this influence are seen in the plethora of war toys and games 
  that our children are so fond of playing with and in their daily vocabulary. 
  When a child was given some building blocks, she immediately proceeded to build 
  a &quot;chain block&quot; (tank) and a helicopter with &quot;guns&quot; sticking 
  out showing clearly how preoccupied children have become with war. This is not 
  helped by the present trend of involving and recruiting younger and younger 
  children into military activities at an age when they cannot quite realise the 
  meaning of their action or its long term consequences. When they act impulsively 
  for kicks and the joy of action, it portends ill for the future. Child psychologists 
  have shown that aggressive behaviour is readily learned by children through 
  observation and imitation of aggressive models and that it can be reinforced 
  and maintained in a variety of rewarding conditions. Thus aggression and violence 
  become a &quot;learned&quot; way of solving problems, when the aggressor is 
  rewarded, for example, by social recognition. This in turn shapes social behaviour 
  where conflicts are solved by aggression and the usual restraints (guilt, conscience) 
  on aggression are reduced and often even morally justified.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:
10.0pt'>This disconcerting development in children in the last few years may prove 
  to be the most far reaching sequelae to the climate of fear and the cult of 
  violence that have been unleashed on this once peace loving society. By all 
  appearances, violence, aggression and non-respect for individual rights is fast 
  becoming part and parcel of our society and a way of life for the next few generations.
