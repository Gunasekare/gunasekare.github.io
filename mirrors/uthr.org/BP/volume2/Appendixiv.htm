<p><b>A statement issued by 50 university teachers during the run-up to the Provincial 
  Council elections of November 1988</b></p>
<p><b> University of Jaffna.<br>
  October end, 1988.</b></p>
<h3 align="center"><br>
  LAYING ASIDE ILLUSIONS</h3>
<p><br>
  On 17 September 1988, the Indian High Commissioner J.N. Dixit held meetings 
  with various sectors of the Jaffna public, at the Jaffna Kachcheri.<br>
  The gist of his message was: The only sane and pragmatic option for the Tamils 
  is to participate in the forthcoming Provincial Council elections for the provisionally 
  merged North-Eastern Province. This would help to fill the political vacuum 
  and sort out thorny issues like land settlement. An elected Provincial Council 
  would make devolution a reality and peace a possibility.<br>
  On the surface, his thesis sounds cogent. But does it correspond to the ground 
  realities?<br>
  Is people's participation in the so-called electoral process a possibility today?<br>
  Free and fair elections presuppose an atmosphere where people can make up their 
  minds without being pressurised at gunpoint - whoever holds the gun.<br>
  What is the reality today? We know that neither individuals nor community organisations 
  can effectively raise their voices against the many human rights violations 
  that continually take place today. People live in fear. They live unsure of 
  their destiny, in terrorised silence - thanks to the acts of omission and commission 
  by the I.P.K.F. and the various armed militant groups. The run-up to the nominations 
  made the situation worse. Almost daily, revenge killings are taking place; innocent 
  middle-aged civilians - both men and women - have been amongst the victims. 
  In many instances the Indian Peace Keeping Force's complicity is well known. 
  No one has the means or the courage to protest - mostly in fear of the I.P.K.F. 
  and the dominant militant groups. In view of such a situation, for India to 
  exhort full participation in what is portrayed as free and fair elections is 
  a parody; especially because India itself is partly responsible for creating 
  such political conditions in the community over the past five years.<br>
  Indian involvement as an instrument in marginalising the people could be traced 
  back to 1983, when India armed the militant groups. Criminal acts by some of 
  them, which included a large number of murders on Indian soil, went calculatedly 
  unchecked. Though India was the common patron of all the groups, divisions and 
  antagonisms between the various groups, grew at a rapid pace, culminating in 
  annihilations.<br>
  Thus it seems not incorrect to presume that India's own interests were being 
  served by maintaining these divisions. The militant groups became large military 
  organisations, accountable to different interests, including clandestine state 
  agencies in India. The people had virtually no check over the activities of 
  the groups. The rate and scale of killings in the community and in the atmosphere 
  created by these, made people live in terror, and left them with little choice 
  but to become passive on-lookers. Thus this past, as well as the present, calls 
  into question India's own claims about its intentions to produce a viable democratic 
  political process.<br>
  However, even if elections could be technically held, whom can Tamils elect 
  as their representatives? Given the present state of divisions and volatility, 
  it is hard to think of anyone who could function as representatives of the people 
  - rather than as rulers. The future of elections will be decided by the manner 
  in which India and the different groups perceive their own interests. The outcome 
  of elections cannot resolve problems arising from habits that have been exacerbated 
  by the prevalence of murder and assassination. Until the emotions arising from 
  this situation have been curbed and people are able to speak out freely, elections 
  will not be welcomed with any degree of enthusiasm.<br>
  It must be mentioned that the generality of Tamils held India in very high regard. 
  There were the links of religion and culture. The leaders of the Indian independence 
  struggle had a devoted following here. Furthermore, in recent times, Tamils 
  owed much gratitude to India for the succour and refuge it provided for Tamils 
  fleeing the state-sponsored violence in Sri Lanka. India also did a great deal 
  to expose the Sri Lankan state's racism internationally. But things changed 
  rapidly from October 1987.<br>
  The erosion of confidence in India amongst the Tamils is the result of hundreds 
  of civilians - men, women and children - being killed by the Indian army during 
  the closing months of 1987; and the mounting toll of disappeared, and victims 
  of torture and deaths in custody, continuing unabated to the present day. When 
  such brutal realities are brushed aside and India is able to speak in paternalistic 
  and threatening tones, the community should realize its own position of weakness. 
  The Tamils should be aware of the problems of relying on India to guarantee 
  peace. It is fairly clear that the present elections as a key for a better future 
  for the community is in serious doubt. What is the alternative? It would be 
  irresponsible as well as fatalistic, just to make pronouncements of powerlessness 
  of the people and lay all the blame on Indian involvement. Such a position would 
  not allow the community to extricate itself from the morass it is in and would 
  amount to empty India bashing. This would still leave the initiative and controlling 
  influence in the hands of external forces.<br>
  We have to examine not only our relations with the Indian and Sri Lankan states, 
  but also ourselves. Our obeisance to terror within the community, and our opportunism 
  and lack of principles in the face of many internal killings, have made it easy 
  for external forces to use the same weapons to control us. In the face of our 
  acquiescence to anti-democratic tendencies within the community, our plea for 
  democracy becomes a meaningless exercise. Many individuals and young persons 
  who voiced criticism of the political forces have been victimised, driven away, 
  or killed while we looked on.<br>
  Thus if the people are to regain their lost self-will and dignity, they will 
  have to move towards a principled collective response. We have to assert universal 
  values to which we are both emotionally and intellectually committed. <br>
  It is the lack of such commitment that enabled us to come to terms with murder, 
  when it concerned others' sons, and, then, watch helplessly in panic when the 
  cancer, allowed to grow, threatened our own sons. We are now paying the price 
  for our past indifference.<br>
  When we look back, there are two aspects to our failing to stand up collectively 
  - as people, as professionals, as institutions or as ordinary workers belonging 
  to unions. First, we were confused about fundamental principles and failed to 
  reach any working agreement. The second is the fear that if one stood up, the 
  person next may let one down, thus placing one in danger. Consequently, a few 
  isolated threats, real or imagined, or even the hint of a gun, have sufficed 
  to close down institutions. We have further dehumanised ourselves by losing 
  a sense of pride in work and service by allowing these to become secondary.<br>
  How do we assert ourselves as people when no one dare take a stand on the many 
  pressing issues? As individuals or small groups in our neighbourhoods, places 
  of work, unions or associations, we must question our past, understand where 
  we went wrong, and rediscover our principles. We must be conscious of the message 
  of past experience, that in standing up for others we also stand up for ourselves. 
  This course requires courage; and, no other is open to us. We have tried to 
  play safe in the past. The result was mass murder from several sources. Non-combatant 
  civilians too became unarmed front-line troops facing the wrath of advancing 
  armies.<br>
  The future looks even more bleak, with the rapid growth and consolidation in 
  southern Sri Lanka of forces of narrow political vision. This opens the door 
  for further involvement by external forces. Let us not remain forever unprepared 
  and continue trapped in the logic of passivity - hoping against hope that someone 
  else will bring us deliverance.<br>
