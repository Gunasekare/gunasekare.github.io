<p align=center style='text-align:center;'><b><span
style='font-size:13.0pt'><a name="top"></a>OCTOBER DAYS</span></b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><b>1.1         Background to the Breakdown of the 
  Accord</b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>It was the tenth day of October 1987 as the curfew was 
  being tolled. Dark billows appearing above the trees and a misty stillness foretold 
  the oncoming rains. The last rays of the setting sun dimly pierced the western 
  sky. There then appeared above, the graceful sight of wild-geese, our Russian 
  winter guests, flying south in V-formation, to winter in the marshlands of peninsular 
  Jaffna. The beauty of the darkening eve was not unmixed with grim foreboding. 
  Our country had seen many tragedies in recent years. Many were hopeful that 
  peace at last had a fighting chance with the signing of the July Accord. The 
  sound of shells and bombs mangling civilians were deemed a thing of the past. 
  But today the city had again reverberated to the sound of shell-fire, and the 
  people once more were gripped by fear and uncertainty.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>Many had watched with dismay the bizarre procession of 
  events in the two months following the Accord. The inherent instability in the 
  arrangements made it inevitable that the bubble should burst. For this reason, 
  who fired the first shot in the hostilities that followed was a question of 
  little importance. In the early hours of the morning, the I.P.K.F. had entered 
  the premises of the Tamil newspapers Eelamurasu and Murasoli which they regarded 
  as being close to the L.T.T.E.. After causing some damage, the I.P.K.F. took 
  away several members of the editorial staffs and press workers. It was then 
  announced that the two papers were sealed. The L.T.T.E. began to mobilise and 
  its armed men were deployed around I.P.K.F. encampments. That afternoon firing 
  was heard from near Jaffna Fort accompanied by the thud of exploding shells. 
  Many said in disbelief: &quot;It cannot be the Indian Army that is shelling 
  us. It must be the Sri Lankan Army.&quot; It was announced on the radio that 
  evening that the L.T.T.E. had fired on the I.P.K.F. at Jaffna Fort and in Tellipallai. 
  Moreover, All India Radio's Madras station underlined the claim that the unit 
  fired upon at Tellipallai had belonged to the Madras Regiment which, according 
  to the same report, had suffered five casualties. Up to this time the I.P.K.F., 
  which moved freely in the Jaffna peninsula, had visited several of the major 
  L.T.T.E. camps. In the two months after the Accord, the I.P.K.F. should have 
  had no difficulty in collecting all the information it wanted, were a surprise 
  move against the L.T.T.E. in the offing. In fact, the I.P.K.F. had maintained 
  a presence at the L.T.T.E.'s main camp opposite the University of Jaffna. What 
  still puzzles many is the question why the I.P.K.F. should throw away its element 
  of surprise in something so trivial as the closure of two newspapers and the 
  confiscation of some television broadcasting equipment. With its man-power, 
  technology and intelligence, there are so many ways in which the I.P.K.F. could 
  have used the advantage of surprise with immense effect. Having alarmed the 
  L.T.T.E., the I.P.K.F. waited for the L.T.T.E. to strike. This was the first 
  sign that things had been terribly bungled. Worse was to come.The build up to 
  the break down of the Accord has been described earlier.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>On 4 October, seventeen L.T.T.E. men travelling in a 
  boat were apprehended off Point Pedro by the Sri Lankan Navy. Those detained 
  included the key L.T.T.E. leaders Mr. Pulendran and Mr. Kumarappa. The Sri Lankan 
  Government claimed that these 17 were acting in breach of the Accord by transporting 
  arms from Tamil Nadu and were also in breach of Sri Lankan immigration formalities. 
  The L.T.T.E. on the other hand claimed that this group was transporting documents 
  in the process of shifting their headquarters from Madras to Jaffna and argued 
  that the question of immigration regulations did not arise, because their leaders 
  had been flown between Madras and Jaffna by the I.P.K.F. without any formalities. 
  The Trincomalee leader Mr. Pulendran had been accused by the Sri Lankan Government 
  of being responsible for leading the massacre of 150 Sinhalese civilians during 
  the unilateral cease fire declared by the Sri Lankan Government for the Sinhalese-Tamil 
  New Year in April that year.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>President J.R. Jayewardene spoke on the state television 
  Rupavahini on two successive days. First he said that the 17 detained were smugglers 
  and were not covered by the Accord. On the second night, he said that they were 
  caught coming back from Tamil Nadu with arms and ammunition.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>The Tigers further said that they were going in a slow 
  boat (fishing trawler) from Jaffna to Tamil Nadu to bring back their furniture 
  and equipment from their main Tamil Nadu office. They also claimed that they 
  had asked the I.P.K.F. high-command in Jaffna to help them bring back the stuff, 
  but their requests were ignored. They also say that only two of their men - 
  Kumarappa (Jaffna commander) and Pulendran (Trincomalee commander) were armed: 
  according to them, this was in keeping with the Accord, as provision had been 
  made for the Tigers to retain arms for self-defence. It is significant that 
  the state-owned Rupavahini did not display the arms and ammunition allegedly 
  seized from the Tigers who were aboard the trawler.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>When Lalith Athulathmudali, the National Security Minister, 
  was asked by a journalist the purpose of detaining the Tigers, he had replied 
  that he would bring them to Colombo just to make them pose before state-television 
  cameras, and would then release them!</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>The Sri Lankan Government insisted on transporting the 
  seventeen detainees who were held in Palaly to Colombo for questioning. The 
  L.T.T.E. appealed to the Indian Government to prevent this. According to press 
  reports the I.P.K.F. and the Indian High Commissioner, Mr. J.N. Dixit, did exert 
  considerable pressure on the Sri Lankan Government to prevent the transport 
  of the detainees. Mr. Dixit said later during a B.B.C. interview that knowing 
  the L.T.T.E., he had warned the Sri Lankan Government of the consequences that 
  may follow from such a course of action. The Sri Lankan Government persisted 
  and a decision was taken to fly the detainees to Colombo on the evening of 5 
  October. It was later reported that the detainees swallowed cyanide as they 
  were about to be taken on board the aeroplane and that twelve of them, including 
  Kumarappa and Pulendran, had succumbed. The question arises, how did these detainees 
  come into possession of cyanide? It can be assumed that the initial routine 
  search of the persons detained would have deprived them of the cyanide capsules 
  carried around their necks.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>The mystery may not be that hard to solve. It was reported 
  that the detainees were taken lunch at 2:00 p.m. on that fateful day by the 
  L.T.T.E.'s deputy leader Mr. Sri Mahattaya in the company of its chief theoretician, 
  Mr. Anton Balasingam. According to a senior official of the I.P.K.F. until the 
  last minute Indian troops were preventing Sri Lankan soldiers at Palaly from 
  taking the detainees into an aeroplane. Around 4:30 p.m., a call came from New 
  Delhi to abandon the efforts and let things take their course. According to 
  this same source, Kumarappa had told him the previous day in a tone of urgency: 
  &quot;You must see my wife today.&quot; This suggests that a battle of brinkmanship 
  had been taking shape for at least a day. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>Given in Appendix II is an extract from a report in Colombo's 
  Sunday Times of 1 October, 1989. This again confirms that the I.P.K.F. was extremely 
  concerned about what might follow if the detainees died. General Rodriguez of 
  the I.P.K.F. had tried everything short of actual force to get the Sri Lanka 
  Army to release the detainees. The stubbornness and a lack of concern for the 
  consequences on Colombo's part, suggests that a section of the Sri Lankan authorities 
  was using the opportunity to trip the I.P.K.F. into a military confrontation 
  with the L.T.T.E..</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>While the U.N.P. was westward looking in its economic 
  policies, the signing of the Accord brought into the open a power struggle within 
  the U.N.P.. A faction which included Gamini Dissanayake and Ronnie de Mel, supported 
  the Accord. A faction which included Premadasa, and had wanted links with the 
  West to go even further, showed evident displeasure. Premadasa had once promoted 
  Sri Lankan membership of A.S.E.A.N., the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. 
  Western aid and training too had been crucial to the Sri Lankan defence establishment 
  in fighting the Tamil insurgency. While there was no ideological quarrel between 
  these two factions, the failure of the Accord would have meant much to vested 
  interests within the U.N.P. as well as the defence establishment. It is also 
  remarkable that, later, in 1989, the Sri Lankan state under Premadasa and the 
  L.T.T.E. should find common cause against the Indian presence.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><b>1.2    The Night of Shame</b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>During the night that followed there took place some 
  events that every son of Jaffna should be deeply ashamed of. Eight Sinhalese 
  soldiers were being held captive by the L.T.T.E., from pre-Accord battles. No 
  one doubted that their release was imminent. The relatives of some of these 
  soldiers had appealed to the L.T.T.E.. The father of one of them, a peasant 
  from Galle, had appealed to a prominent Roman Catholic clergyman with connections 
  in Jaffna, after several futile efforts at appealing to the Minister for National 
  Security. On the 6th morning, the blind-folded corpses of these eight soldiers 
  were found dumped in the city's main bus-stand with bullet wounds.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>At the time, Mr. Jayamanne, the General Manager (G.M.) 
  and Mr. Gajanayake, the Deputy G.M. of Lanka Cement Ltd. (or L.C.L.) were in 
  Jaffna for the recommissioning of L.C.L.'s plant at K.K.S.. The plant had been 
  closed on 22 April when an L.T.T.E. attack on K.K.S. harbour had resulted in 
  the deaths of 18 Sri Lankan troops and the reprisal killing of five L.C.L. employees 
  by the Sri Lankan Army. Seventy other employees then working at the harbour 
  were saved by the timely action of a ship captain, a Sinhalese, who, fearing 
  reprisals by Sri Lankan troops, promptly took them aboard his ship and put out 
  to sea. The two cement plants at K.K.S. suffered considerable damage during 
  the shelling of the subsequent months. In an unprecedented move which earned 
  him the gratitude of the employees, Mr. Jayamanne took the lead in ensuring 
  that even the casual employees of the two cement plants were paid during the 
  long period of closure. Even those who did not agree with his methods of management, 
  respected him as an able and enthusiastic engineer. On the previous day, Mr. 
  Jayamanne had seen off some C.E.B. (Ceylon Electricity Board) engineers whom 
  he had persuaded to come to Jaffna in order to commission a new transformer 
  for L.C.L.. Mr. Jayamanne was amongst those Sinhalese who believed that Jaffna 
  had a great future following the Indo-Lanka Accord. He was hopeful of restarting 
  the L.C.L. plant the following day. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>On the 5th night, Jayamanne and Gajanayake were having 
  a friendly after-dinner chat with several colleagues, including engineers Sothilingam, 
  Velayutham and Arivalagan at the L.C.L. guest house. Around mid-night several 
  armed man burst into the guest house and wanted to take Jayamanne and Gajanayake 
  away. Their colleagues protested. Velayutham who protested strenuously was badly 
  assaulted. Jayamanne and Gajanayake were finally taken away and their dead bodes 
  were found opposite the Cement Corporation gates the following morning.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>There was a great deal of anger and sorrow at the two 
  cement works at K.K.S.. They badly wanted to issue a protest leaflet condemning 
  the killings of Mr. Jayamanne and Mr. Gajanayake and to send condolence messages 
  to their families. But this desire was outweighed by fear. There were informers 
  about and no one wished to be identified as being amongst the leaders of such 
  a move. One leaflet purportedly issued by the cement workers expressed sorrow 
  at the deaths of the twelve L.T.T.E. men. No mention was made of the murdered 
  Sinhalese.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>Another person murdered on the 5th night was an elderly 
  Sinhalese baker who re-started his bakery at Chunnakam after the Accord. An 
  A.G.A. (Assistant Government Agent) recounted his meeting with this baker. On 
  that occasion he had been in his office when he was approached by a man with 
  a bowed head. He had obviously suffered much hardship. This man addressed him 
  as Mahattaya (meaning Sir). The A.G.A., surprised at hearing Sinhalese being 
  spoken in Jaffna, listened to this man's tale. He said that he had to abandon 
  his premises at Chunnakam and move south after the 1983 riots. Being a small 
  holder he had no other means of livelihood and had no alternative but to come 
  back and re-start his trade at Chunnakam. The A.G.A. was very much grieved at 
  the killing of such a harmless man.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>What follows is the account of the killing of a Sinhalese 
  police officer at Valvetithurai (V.V.T.) on the 5th night as related by a professional 
  resident there. Following the reopening of the Valvetithurai Police Station 
  after the Accord, certain Sinhalese police officers used to pay evening visits 
  to the local bar to drink and to fraternise. One such police officer was present 
  at the bar on the 5th night. At about 8 p.m., Soosai, the Vadamaratchi leader 
  of the L.T.T.E. and another person entered the bar and started assaulting the 
  police officer mercilessly. He was then dragged out and was beaten to death 
  with a wooden pole. The following day L.T.T.E. sources attributed this and the 
  other killings of Sinhalese to the &quot;people,&quot; who they said had become 
  angry over the suicides of the twelve L.T.T.E. men. But the people of V.V.T. 
  were deeply hurt that they were being held responsible for such an inhuman act.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>Indeed, the Jaffna dailies attributed these killings 
  to unknown persons. These were followed by a spate of killings of Sinhalese 
  civilians in the Eastern Province. Thirty five long term Sinhalese residents 
  of Batticaloa were gunned down. A land mine explosion killed Batticaloa's S.T.F. 
  chief Nimal Silva. Mr. Antonymuthu (Government Agent, Batticaloa) who was travelling 
  in the same vehicle was also killed. The B.B.C. reported that in the days that 
  followed, a total of about 200 Sinhalese civilians were killed.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>These events must be viewed in the context that shortly 
  after the Accord, the L.T.T.E.'s deputy leader Mr. Sri Mahattaya told the Weekend, 
  a national newspaper, that the Sinhalese civilians were welcome to visit Jaffna 
  and that no harm would befall them. Thus many Tamils in Jaffna regarded these 
  killings as a breach of hospitality. It must also be kept in mind that many 
  Sinhalese who visited Jaffna after the Accord did so with a feeling that the 
  Tamils were fellow countrymen who had been wronged and that it was time for 
  them to understand the Tamils and to build bridges. Especially many women felt 
  that it was very wrong to have killed those soldiers who had been fed with their 
  own hands for several months. In another development four members of the Rupavahini 
  (the state television station) crew were abducted in Jaffna and were presumed 
  killed. A lecturer in English and his bride, both Tamils, who were spending 
  their honeymoon at Subash Hotel were rudely awakened by armed men who were going 
  room by room looking for Sinhalese.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>One may ask, if Mr. Dixit did foresee the consequences 
  resulting from an attempt to transport the detainees, why did he not use his 
  authority to act decisively to prevent such an attempt as he very well could 
  have? According to the I.P.K.F. official quoted earlier, the order to abandon 
  efforts to prevent the transport of detainees had come from New Delhi. This 
  means the decision did not rest with Mr. Dixit, suggesting that New Delhi was 
  preparing to take its gloves off. And then, having got most of what it wanted 
  at the time of Mr. Thileepan's death, why did the L.T.T.E. take such an unexpected 
  course? Perhaps, the Indians were becoming tired of a role where they had to 
  be constantly arguing with two sides, both of whom were in some way dissatisfied 
  with the Accord.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>The decision that the seventeen L.T.T.E. detainees should 
  commit suicide together with the killings of Sinhalese from the night of 5 October, 
  was an open challenge to the Accord. The Indian Government was already under 
  pressure, being accused of inaction in the face of a drifting situation. If 
  the Indian Government still did nothing, it would have been accused of badly 
  letting down the Sri Lankan Government which had risked a good deal on the Accord 
  which India was to implement.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>The Indian Defence Minister, Mr. K.C. Pant, and the Indian 
  Army Chief of Staff, Mr. Krishna Sunderji, promptly arrived in Colombo. The 
  Ceylon Daily News of 9 October announced in its headlines that the I.P.K.F. 
  was to launch a terminal campaign against the L.T.T.E.. Few will disagree that 
  India was called upon to act. What is in question is the manner in which it 
  acted and the tragic consequences that ensued. These will be dealt with in a 
  separate chapter.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>We note here that one conspiracy theory that gained a 
  certain amount of popularity with Tamils was to the effect that President Jayewardene 
  was such a cunning man, who having signed the Accord with India, played his 
  cards with consummate skill - so much so, that it culminated in the suicides 
  of twelve L.T.T.E. men, thus trapping India into taking on the Tamils. India, 
  the theory proceeds to maintain, was cleverly trapped by President Jayewardene 
  into doing a job which the Sri Lankan forces could not do. It is understandable 
  that President Jayewardene, out of office since December 1988, should promote 
  the first theory.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>The weakness in conspiracy theories is that there are 
  so many unknowns in human affairs that it is easy enough to invent another conspiracy 
  theory which says quite the opposite. It can, for instance, be maintained that 
  the Indians acted so cleverly, that upon finding the Sinhalese and Tamils of 
  Ceylon such volatile and unreliable negotiating partners, the Indians trapped 
  them into blundering themselves into corners. Thus the acceptance of Indian 
  suzerainty became the only way out for them both. Quite apart from possible 
  roles by vested interests, developments in the Tamil region by themselves, had 
  already put the Accord into trouble.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>The overwhelming evidence of events is that no party 
  to the conflict possessed the delicate skill or means, by which to control events 
  or even to fulfil its stated intentions. In statements issued soon after the 
  Accord of 29 July, the Chief of the Indian Army's Southern Command, Lt. Gen. 
  Depinder Singh, gave the impression that he had the means to disarm the L.T.T.E. 
  with consummate skill if the need arose. The loss of life and property that 
  followed in the wake of the Indian Army's action which commenced on 10 October, 
  left the impression of a hacksaw having been used where fine surgery had been 
  promised. The Indian Embassy which had been a severe critic of the Sri Lankan 
  Government's military campaign in the Tamil areas, especially the shelling and 
  bombing of the civilian population, was left reacting to events rather than 
  dictating them when the Indian Army used similar methods.</span> <a href="#top">[Top]</a></p>
