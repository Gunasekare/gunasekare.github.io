  III</span></b></p>
<p class=Headera align=center style='text-align:center;
'><span
style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A talk delivered by Rajan 
  Hoole on behalf of the University Teachers for Human Rights at the Rajani Thiranagama 
  Commemoration meeting on 2 October, 1989, at the Kailasapathy Auditorium, University 
  of Jaffna.</span></p>
<p class=Headera><b>III.1  Dr. Rajani Thiranagama: </b><b>Her contribution to 
  the University </b><b>Teachers for Human Rights (U.T.H.R.)</b></p>
<p class=Headera style='text-align:justify;'>In the course of a brief talk, we 
  are faced with the task of doing justice to the breadth of vision that governed 
  Rajani's contribution to human rights work. If one were to pick a brief quotation 
  from her writings that may give us an indication of her perspective, the following 
  would do well: &#147;Objectivity, the pursuit of truth and the propagation of 
  critical and honest positions, were not only crucial for the community, but 
  could also cost many of us our lives. They were only undertaken as a survival 
  task&#148;. This is taken from a postscript that Rajani wrote for the &#145;Broken 
  Palmyrah&#146; during the weeks preceding her murder. Prophetic as these words 
  may seem, it was not like her to be prophetic. I shall try to make clear what 
  she meant.</p>
<p class=Headera style='text-align:justify;'><b>III.2     The Degeneration of 
  Politics and </b><b>Implications for Human Rights Work</b><span
style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";letter-spacing:-.1pt'></span></p>
<p class=Headera style='text-align:justify;'>Up to the early 1980&#146;s, there 
  was amongst a sizable section of Tamil youth, a healthy interest in political 
  issues, accompanied by idealism. The issues were often those of social injustice 
  and their national and international dimensions. And, quite surprisingly, there 
  was a remarkable absence of communalism which was poisoning the air in the country. 
  But the 1983 riots and the involvement of foreign resources in the militarisation 
  of our youth, ensured that the tendency which gained ground was that of extreme 
  nationalism that worshipped military success, and, by its very nature, became 
  intolerant. Every other political tendency felt impelled to imitate this, even 
  at the cost of coming out second or third best. Politics died as homicidal divisions 
  increased. We know well our recent history which led to a remarkable indifference 
  to any kind of social or political effort on the part of today&#146;s university 
  students. Guns seemed to determine everything. In this atmosphere of disillusionment, 
  militant groups were finding themselves obliged to strengthen themselves against 
  each other by taking in very young persons through a variety of questionable 
  methods. The role of the Indian and Sri Lankan states in this episode is a shameful 
  one. Rajani was very concerned about the fate of these young men. She had a 
  deep compassion for these young men who could not understand their actions, 
  viewed death as a welcome certainty and hated the community which has done nothing 
  while they were consigned to this degrading  form of slavery.</p>
<p class=Headera style='text-align:justify;'><span>        </span>What then became 
  of the young idealists of the 1970&#146;s and early 1980&#146;s mentioned earlier? 
  You find them apart from those who went abroad, in farms, factories and shops. 
  With their trained intelligence they have a sure grasp of what is happening 
  around. In the absence of any political force they could align with, some have 
  lapsed into cynicism. Others feel that no effort is worth while and have chosen 
  silence. In general, the community has become polarised into sections which 
  believe in aligning themselves to one military force or the other, purely for 
  the purpose of wiping out the other side. This was believed to be a necessary 
  first step to all further plans.</p>
<p class=Headera style='text-align:justify;'><span>        </span>It was an atmosphere 
  in which any attempt at objectivity or impartiality was bound to be viewed as, 
  at best, an academic exercise, and, at worst, a futile nuisance and a bar to 
  more important things - such as wiping out the other side by pitting our boys 
  against each other, with the Indian and Sri Lankan states playing the role of 
  the erratic gods in Homer&#146;s Illiad.</p>
<p class=Headera style='text-align:justify;'><span>        </span>Rajani and the 
  others in the U.T.H.R. believed that these options were destructive, unjust, 
  superficial and cowardly.  She believed that an alternative had to be found. 
  This was closely tied to her vision for the University of Jaffna after the October 
  1987 war. She believed that it was not merely shameful negligence for a university 
  to be indifferent under such circumstances, but also that a university could 
  not survive as a university if it is to be indifferent.</p>
<p class=Headera style='text-align:justify;'><span>        </span>Thus in Rajani's 
  view, the task of expressing the truth of what is going on around us impartially, 
  and making people feel for the tragedy, became a survival task. This is what 
  the U.T.H.R. (Jaffna) tried to do in its first two reports. Rajani used the 
  expression &quot;Creating a Space&quot; to describe this work.  She hoped that 
  it will lead to some discussion, at least within the university, of what was 
  happening around. She believed that sound values and anger  against hypocrisy 
  and injustice were major assets in the task of survival. Rajani admired the 
  women from our coastal villages who possessed some of these qualities. She believed 
  that courage was of the essence. She had often said that to make an impact on 
  destructive tendencies which commanded respect by treating their own lives lightly, 
  one had to be prepared to give one&#146;s own life for one&#146;s beliefs. She 
  did not flinch from this ideal.</p>
<p class=Headera style='text-align:justify;'><b>III.3     Human Rights and Politics</b></p>
<p class=Headera style='text-align:justify;'>Rajani was very much concerned with 
  politics and would have been the last person to view human rights work in isolation. 
  In describing the work of the U.T.H.R., I have heard her tell others, &#147;A 
  life is a life. Whoever takes life must be exposed independently of party feeling. 
  We wanted to show, that in the first place, we valued life&#148;. She held that  
  a human rights organisation cannot be affiliated to a political party, because 
  of the independent nature of its work. But it can have as members persons from 
  political parties with  a firm commitment to human rights. A human rights organisation 
  should also welcome a commitment to human rights by a political organisation.</p>
<p class=Headera style='text-align:justify;'><span>        </span>In our context, 
  there is no political force with a commitment to respect and defend human rights. 
  Nor is there any question of a human rights organisation spending its time giving 
  advice to political forces. We are dealing with what are, in fact, military 
  organisations with their own leaders and advisors with respectable scholarly 
  credentials from an assortment  of Western capitals. Any local functionary who 
  listens to you with sympathy is, at the drop of a pin, bound by orders from 
  the top. Thus in our context, a human rights organisation has to put itself 
  out on a limb depending on moral pressure and public concern for its defence. 
  This was a minimum Rajani had expected from the university community.</p>
<p class=Headera style='text-align:justify;'><b>III.4      Rajani's  work  amongst  
  Students</b></p>
<p class=Headera style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";letter-spacing:-.1pt'>As 
  a human rights activist living in this community, Rajani's work had<u> </u>many 
  facets to it. These included work in women&#146;s concerns, her role as both 
  doctor and counsellor, and help rendered to individuals from the depressed sections 
  of society that were driven to the edge of despair. Some of these are being 
  dealt with by more appropriate speakers. The foregoing will sound like abstract 
  theory, unless it is seen that there was a workable practical side to it. I 
  shall confine myself to examples from university life.</span></p>
<p class=Headera style='text-align:justify;'><span>        </span>Rajani recognised 
  that given the chronic social climate, there were bound to be many students 
  having problems connected with past associations and queer ways of thinking. 
  She believed that they had to be weaned away into creative channels through 
  frank discussion, together with a relationship of trust and personal concern. 
  To start with, she defended a student&#146;s right to have his or her own opinions 
  - even ones she strongly disagreed with. On her return from England, she was 
  angry that the university  had not lodged a protest over a medical student who 
  was shot and injured on 31 August, 1989, while returning from clinical work. 
  She was indignant that the I.P.K.F., while declaring on the one hand that people 
  were free to support any political opinion provided they did not carry arms, 
  were, on the other, citing alleged subversive involvement as an excuse after 
  a person was shot without any questioning or examination. She felt that the 
  university had sacrificed an important principle and was urging even a belated 
  protest over the shooting of the medical student.</p>
<p class=Headera style='text-align:justify;'><span>        </span>She would sometimes 
  spend hours discussing the problems of a student who had political involvements. 
  While helping the student, she would firmly tell the student that his political 
  opinions were destructive and her hope was that he would re-examine his course 
  and grow out of it. In one instance she was approached by a student who was 
  asked to report for questioning. She held that no one who tortured had a moral 
  right to interrogate others. She told the student not to go, and if asked, to 
  say that she, as his student counsellor, had ordered him not to go. The matter 
  ended there.</p>
<p class=Headera style='text-align:justify;'><span>        </span>She valued life 
  and felt sorry when anyone was killed - be it a militant from any one of the 
  groups or an Indian soldier. She was saddened that they all died without knowing 
  for what cause they gave their lives. </p>
<p class=Headera style='text-align:justify;'><b>III.5     Rajani and the reopening 
  of the U</b><b>niversity following October 1987</b></p>
<p class=Headera style='text-align:justify;'>The crisis facing the community following 
  the Indian offensive of October 1987 was one which brought out her energy and 
  strength of character. She was so appalled after seeing the conditions of refugees 
  at Nallur Kandasamy Kovil, that she sat down to write a leaflet. She felt that 
  the reopening of the university was the best chance of having some means for 
  the defence of the community. She said that we cannot sit around waiting for 
  the Indians to ask us to come in and conduct lectures. She urged her friends 
  to go and make arrangements for the staff to enter the university immediately. 
  Attempts to have the university reopened were made from about 10 November, entry 
  was gained on 15 November and arrangements were made for the staff to meet on 
  18 November.. The Indian Army was in control of the premises at that time. A 
  section of the staff felt so numbed by the damage that they advocated not doing 
  anything until outsiders came and the damage was publicised. Rajani held that 
  we had existed long enough as a community displaying our sores and eliciting 
  pity. She felt that,. to prevent the recurrence of such a catastrophe, we must 
  show a will of our own to make our own future. Thereafter work commenced on 
  securing what had survived the war. Rajani was the first member of the staff 
  to enter the medical faculty, which was in a more isolated area. Those were 
  days when people were scared of soldiers. With curfew commencing at 4:00 p.m, 
  roads were deserted by 12:00 p.m.; but Rajani, a single woman, would sometimes 
  stay on with a carpenter and one or two others, fixing locks to doors in the 
  medical faculty until 1:30 p.m.. I recall shifting typewriters and other equipment 
  in the company of labourers to secured rooms, under her supervision. Soldiers 
  who were about the medical faculty came to refer to her as &quot;The Principal&quot;.</p>
<p class=Headera style='text-align:justify;'><span>        </span>On one occasion, 
  a Sikh soldier rushed into her room while she was arranging it. On discovering 
  that she was a doctor, he sat down and explained a personal medical problem 
  to her. He had received a head injury during the 1971 war which gave birth to 
  Bangladesh. He had been warded in Chandigarh, and still suffered recurrent pains. 
  Rajani listened sympathetically. Rajani's courage and example were such that 
  many men, particularly non-academic staff, came to depend on her for motivation 
  and direction.</p>
<p class=Headera style='text-align:justify;'><span>        </span>It was then 
  common for Indian officers to attack the militants and blame them for everything. 
  Tamils commonly responded by saying that they did not know the militants and 
  were innocent. But Rajani took the officers head on and would say forth-rightly: 
  &#147;We as a community must take responsibility for  our catastrophe. The militants 
  are part of our history, and a part of our community. I cannot artificially 
  distance myself from the militants and condemn them&#148;. She felt  that all 
  the risks she took at that time had to be taken because the young men who took 
  many risks and had brought the community to this state, were likely to respect 
  only those who themselves took risks.</p>
<p class=Headera style='text-align:justify;'><b>III.6     Jaffna Hospital</b></p>
<p class=Headera style='text-align:justify;'>Rajani was busy with many things 
  during the weeks succeeding the  war of  October 1987. She would cycle to far 
  away places with other women, collecting experiences of what mothers, young 
  girls and elderly women had been through during the war. Roads were then dotted 
  with sentry points and people were still scared. Much of what she recorded appeared 
  in the &quot;Broken Palmyrah&quot;. She also spent a good deal of time counselling 
  and helping women who were affected by rape, and deaths or disappearances of 
  near ones. Many came to her when the word spread that Rajani would do what she 
  could.</p>
<p class=Headera style='text-align:justify;'><span>        </span>One incident 
  which concerned her greatly was the massacre at Jaffna Hospital on 21 October, 
  1987, during the Indian assault, that left about 70 dead. Rajani felt that the 
  callousness of the Indian entry  was inexcuseable. Many of  the doctors felt  
  that it was too dangerous  to bring out the truth. Some felt that they should 
  wait for an appropriate time.There was even a fear of issuing  public appreciations 
  for the medical staff killed.Rajani felt that the truth  should be brought out 
  at the earliest and set about interviewing staff at the hospital where she had 
  once worked. The following extracts are from the &quot;Broken Palmyrah,&quot; 
  written in her inimitable prose:</p>
<p class=Headera style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";letter-spacing:-.1pt'>&#147;So 
  we lay down quietly, under one of the dead bodies, throughout the night. One 
  of the overseers had a cough and he groaned and coughed once in a way in the 
  night. One Indian soldier threw a grenade at this man, killing some more persons. 
  I know the ambulance driver died. In another spot, one man got up with his hand 
  up and cried out: &#147;We are innocent. We are supporters of Indira Gandhi&#148;. 
  A grenade was thrown at him. He and his brother next to him died.</span></p>
<p class=Headera style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";letter-spacing:-.1pt'>&#147;......The 
  blasting grenades made tremendous noises as if bombs were exploding. Then the 
  debris and dust would settle on us and cake in the fresh blood of those dead 
  and injured&#148;.</span></p>
<p class=Headera style='text-align:justify;'><b>III.7      Challenge to the University</b></p>
<p class=Headera style='text-align:justify;'>What Rajani believed in was not an 
  abstract philosophy,but something that evolved to the demands of a social conscience 
  and insisted on both compassion and consistency. Her courage was tied to a sense 
  of responsibility. There is no doubt that she was practically effective. She 
  died because the rest of the community valued her services, but was too cowardly 
  and cautious to emulate her sense of responsibility. For many, the accepted 
  wisdom is not to take any risk, but to rely on the risks taken by others. If 
  we have for the present, the uncertain present, the option of clinging to positions 
  while shirking moral responsibility or of slinking away with degrees without 
  caring to secure the future  well being of the student community, it is because 
  there were fools like Rajani.</p>
<p><span>                </span>At this time of crisis and tragedy, many students 
  have shown courage and responsibility. A number of persons in the university 
  have displayed commendable qualities of leadership. All this may appear to be 
  in vain unless these become part of the character of the university as a whole. 
  It is in the nature of the powers around us to have us silent and indifferent. 
  We cannot remain a university if only a small minority feel for its mission. 
  It is only human to become tired when driven to isolation.[<a href="#top">Top</a>]</p>
