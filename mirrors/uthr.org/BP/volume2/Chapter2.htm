<p align=center style='text-align:center;'><b><span
style='font-size:13.0pt'>INDIA'S ROLE - AN OVERVIEW</span></b><span
style='font-size:13.0pt'> <b><sup></sup></b></span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><b>2.1 Expectations about India's Role</b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>In the weeks that followed the agony of the July 1983 
  racial violence, almost the entire population of the Tamils of Ceylon turned 
  to India for protection. India responded to the crisis by first sending its 
  Foreign Minister Narasinha Rao and then its special envoy Gopalaswamy Parthasarathy, 
  to negotiate a settlement between the Government and the Tamil representatives. 
  In the Sunday Times of 16 August, 1987, Mr. Neelan Tiruchelvam (T.U.L.F.) had 
  praised the scholarly and painstaking efforts of Mr. Parthasarathy's which were 
  combined with disarming courtesy. The substance of the proposals drafted by 
  Mr. Parthasarathy in consultation with President Jayawardene and accepted by 
  the President was contained in the document known as Annexure C. Later, the 
  President had other ideas and went back on these proposals. These proposals 
  with variations have represented India's stand. The same family of ideas form 
  the fabric of the December 19th proposals and finally the accord of 29 July, 
  1987. All these have envisaged provincial councils with substantial powers over 
  law, education and policing devolved to them. The tricky issues over which considerable 
  time continues to be spent, centre around the question of land-settlement on 
  which the Tamils have well-founded fears. Everyone knows that India also had 
  certain foreign policy interests in Ceylon. A commitment to non-alignment had 
  served Sri Lanka well where relations with India were concerned. But friction 
  had been created by the Jayawardene Government's tilting towards the West. India 
  would also like to ensure that no hostile power would use the natural harbour 
  at Trincomalee. These were not grudged. The Tamils were confident that India 
  would never let them down. Up to this point no one had anything but good words 
  for India's efforts.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>In the wake of July 1983, together with refugees, a substantial 
  number of militant recruits were also heading towards Tamil Nadu, the latter 
  for training. This was India's second front in the event of the negotiations 
  failing. Today's problems originate from the manner in which this front was 
  handled.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>Shortly after agreeing to Mr. Parthasarathy's proposals, 
  Lalith Athulathmudali was appointed minister for the new Ministry of National 
  Security in January 1984. Defence expenditures soon escalated to the region 
  of U.S. $ 300,000,000, or 15 to 20% of the national budget. It soon became clear 
  that Sri Lanka had moved closer to the West, making new arrangements with western 
  powers, in a fresh bid to find a military solution to its Tamil problem. Though 
  Ceylon had severed diplomatic links with Israel in 1970, an Israeli Interests 
  Section was established on the U.S. Embassy premises in Colombo in 1984. The 
  Israeli agencies Mossad and Shin Bet, which specialised in under-cover and intelligence 
  operations, began helping the Sri Lankan forces (as described in the article 
  by Jane Hunter in <i>Israeli Foreign Affairs</i>, May 1986). Keeny Meeny Services 
  (K.M.S.), an off-shore British security form, made available former S.A.S. men 
  to train Sri Lanka's notorious Special Task Force (S.T.F.). The contention by 
  British officials that this was a purely commercial arrangement between a private 
  firm and the Sri Lankan government, was taken to be merely for the sake of formality. 
  Pakistani instructors became involved in training, both in Pakistan and Sri 
  Lanka, the Black Shirts (a unit of the Sri Lanka Army in black uniform) and 
  Home Guard units. The training of the Black Shirts, popularly known as the Black 
  Devils, reportedly involved teaching them to look upon Tamils as enemies. This 
  was reflected in the utter devastation of Tamil villages in the Trincomalee 
  District where they were deployed. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>Central to these arrangements was evidently, the role 
  of the United States. President Ronald Reagan's envoy General Vernon Walters, 
  who later was to be the U.S. Ambassador to the U.N., arrived in Colombo in December 
  1984 and is reported to have had talks with President Jayewardene and Lalith 
  Athulathmudali. With India providing succour to the Tamil militants, it appeared 
  as though a proxy war was being fought in Ceylon between Indian and Western 
  interests, from 1984 to mid-1987. This period also marked the beginning of the 
  proliferation of state sponsored paramilitary forces in Sri Lanka, a process 
  that had a momentum of its own.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>However, Tamils in Ceylon were generally confident that 
  Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was equal to meeting the deceitfulness of the Sri 
  Lankan regime. It is said that when the T.U.L.F. leader, Mr. Amirthalingam, 
  received news of her assassination when he was at the Jaffna Railway Station 
  in October 1984, he was rendered speechless for several minutes. Her death was 
  perhaps mourned with greater intensity in Jaffna than anywhere else. Be that 
  as it may, except for a change in style, it would be erroneous to suppose that 
  Indian policy changed substantively after Mrs. Gandhi. The Tamil leadership, 
  both T.U.L.F. and militant, did however feel treated less respectfully by India 
  following her demise. This treatment might have had serious negative consequences 
  in the long term, particularly in Indian dealings with the L.T.T.E..</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>The present mood amongst the Tamils of Ceylon is one 
  of bewilderment over India's conduct during the war of October 1987. The pain 
  and shock of mental disillusionment with India has been only slightly less than 
  those from the physical suffering. People could hardly believe their ears as 
  the Indians shelled them from land and air. &quot;Perhaps&quot;, they said, 
  &quot;this shelling is only a misguided preliminary. The Indian soldiers are 
  different from Sri Lankan soldiers. They will be reasonable once they come.&quot; 
  This hope too was tragically disappointed as hundreds were shot dead for no 
  other reason than that they were in a place where the Indian troops were angry.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>When people expressed their feelings to Indian army officers 
  and asked why this happened, they were told: &quot;This is war; we have lost 
  three hundred men. Be happy that you are alive and think about the future.&quot; 
  When people say: &quot;India said she was sending her troops to protect us. 
  But now, as a result of Indian Army action we have lost many of our children, 
  fathers and mothers, as well as our houses and goods.&quot;, they are told in 
  response: &quot;These things happen in war, there is nothing we can do.&quot; 
  The results of Indian involvement are clearly different from what the world 
  expected.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>It is well to look into the persistent criticism made 
  by the Indian government against the military action of the Sri Lankan government 
  in the Tamil areas. Every time there was civilian suffering amongst the Tamils 
  as a result of the Sri Lankan government's military action, India was unfailing 
  in expressing her concern. The Sri Lankan Government's military action culminated 
  in the shelling and bombing of the civilian population, shelling of hospitals, 
  the killing of patients, massacres of civilians, torture and the displacement 
  of populations. All these were again and again roundly condemned by India. The 
  case against the Sri Lankan Government has been pursued at the U.N. Human Rights 
  Sub-commission by India. The Prime Minister of India has repeatedly warned the 
  Sri Lankan government against its attempts at a military solution of the ethnic 
  question, stressing that only a political solution would be viable. The Indian 
  government exerted pressure, on humanitarian grounds, on the Sri Lankan government 
  to prevent it from closing Jaffna Hospital. The Indian air drop of relief supplies 
  to Jaffna on 4 June 1987 and the supply of food to Jaffna's residents by the 
  Indian Red Cross were publicly motivated by the sufferings of numerous refugees 
  following the Sri Lankan Government's Vadamaratchi operation.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>It was clear to the international community that the 
  role envisaged for the I.P.K.F. (Indian Peace Keeping Force) in Ceylon was a 
  most unusual one. Though legal technicalities were satisfied, the wide-spread 
  feeling remained that Ceylon's national independence and sovereignty were put 
  into question. Yet the international community welcomed this arrangement, mainly 
  for the reason that they felt that the Sri Lankan Government was unable to solve 
  this problem. It lacked the will to solve it and, because of the immense human 
  suffering it had caused, it lacked the moral right to try again. Thus the international 
  community expected far higher standards of India and expected India to solve 
  the problem competently, without resort to methods similar to those of the Sri 
  Lankan government. Indian spokesmen, including Lieutenant General Depinder Singh, 
  Chief of the Southern Command, gave the impression that if the need arose they 
  possessed competent means to retrieve arms from the L.T.T.E. (Liberation Tigers 
  of Tamil Eelam). Moreover India's coming to Ceylon as a peace keeping force 
  was expected to place restraints on her mode of operation. Her men were expected 
  to be thoroughly disciplined and sensitive to civilian problems.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>It was clearly unacceptable that the I.P.K.F. should 
  fire shells into civilian populated areas. When questioned, Indian officers 
  would say that if they are ordered to take a town they must first shell it, 
  adding that we civilians are ignorant of military methods. We feel here that 
  such a stand-point is unacceptable in terms of what was expected of a peace 
  keeping force and in terms of India's oft repeated sentiments on the matter. 
  The shelling seldom affected or intimidated the L.T.T.E.. The victims were almost 
  always civilians. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>Apart from the expectations of the international community 
  and the Tamils, such use of its fire power by the I.P.K.F. must also be seen 
  in the context of a remark made by the Prime Minister of India in early 1987, 
  when questioned by the Press as to whether the situation in Sri Lanka had any 
  resemblance to that in the Punjab. The Prime Minister of India replied, that 
  unlike the Government of Sri Lanka, the Government of India had neither shelled 
  nor aerially bombarded its own civilian population. India's moral right to intervene 
  in Sri Lanka was based on the expectation that it would fulfil obligations, 
  which the Sri Lankan Government could not keep towards Tamil civilians.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><b>2.2 India and the Militants</b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>It is generally known that senior members of militant 
  groups were resident in Tamil Nadu. The repeated claim by the Sri Lankan government 
  and the international press was that the militants were receiving both arms 
  and training through India. India's position has been that she had only Tamil 
  refugees. However the Sri Lankan government took its claim seriously and attached 
  the highest importance to sealing off the Palk Straits by strengthening and 
  deploying its navy. Several militant leaders and expatriate Tamils have been 
  frank about the links the Indian government and its intelligence agency R.A.W. 
  had with militant groups. Such relationships ignore moral considerations and 
  are governed by mutual cynicism. Each thought it was using the other.</span></p>

style='font-size:10.0pt'>Amongst the Tamil civilians in Ceylon, there was the 
  uncomfortable feeling that they did not really matter and were merely pawns 
  in the game. Still people generally expected high standards from India. More 
  doubts emerged as the result of the conduct of the Indian police and the Tamil 
  Nadu government over internal killings in India. Accounts of torture and killings 
  by the P.L.O.T.E. of its own members, many of whom had qualms of conscience, 
  emerged in many prominent Indian newspapers around early 1985. These killings 
  had taken place on Indian soil. The matter was ignored by the police. Such experiences 
  with the Indian police were many. To give two instances, Mr. Santhathiar, a 
  prominent P.L.O.T.E. dissident, was murdered by members of the P.L.O.T.E. in 
  Tamil Nadu. The police took no action when a report was made by Mr. A. David, 
  a senior architect from Ceylon. Subsequently, an influential Tamil expatriate 
  in London telephoned a businessman-friend in Tamil Nadu, who in turn contacted 
  Mr. Somasundaram, a minister in the State Government. It was after all this 
  that the accused was taken in, only to be released later. Another case is that 
  of Ruban who left the L.T.T.E. for reasons of conscience and became involved 
  in refugee work. One day in late 1984, he was walking in the company of friends 
  when he was accosted by members of the L.T.T.E.. They proceeded to beat him 
  to death. No action was taken when a well known figure reported the matter to 
  the Tamil Nadu Police. It is relevant here that the militant leaders, especially 
  Mr. Prabhakaran of the L.T.T.E. and Mr. Uma Maheswaran of the P.L.O.T.E. moved 
  in the highest circles in South India and their organisations were well-funded. 
  Reports have persistently surfaced in the press linking some of the militant 
  groups with the narcotics trade. The latest was a report by the London Sunday 
  Times' investigation team linking the L.T.T.E. prominently with this trade [Sunday 
  Times (London) 30 August 87]. It was clear that the process of the law in India 
  had been interfered with to an extent that many countries would have considered 
  intolerable, for reasons of expediency. What this will mean for India in the 
  long run is another question.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'>The Sri Lankan Government and the international 
  community were publicly aware that India was using the Tamil militant groups 
  to twist the Sri Lankan Government's arm. Informed observers in Jaffna were 
  aware that the L.T.T.E. could obtain enough arms to keep the Sri Lankan Army 
  at bay and no more. It was unable to obtain anti-aircraft weapons. The gift 
  by Tamil Nadu's Chief Minister, Mr. M.G. Ramachandran, of £3 million to the 
  L.T.T.E. and £1 million to the E.R.O.S. for &quot;refugee work&quot; soon after 
  the Sri Lankan Government's &quot;Operation Liberation&quot;, is another case 
  in point. Considering that there were several institutions more experienced 
  in refugee work, this was generally treated as a gesture of support for the 
  L.T.T.E. and the E.R.O.S. having the blessings of the Indian Government. This 
  was hinted at by the B.B.C.'s Mark Tully.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>During the two months after the Indo-Sri Lanka accord 
  of 1987, the I.P.K.F. isolated itself from the public. But some of its senior 
  men had close relations with the L.T.T.E. high ranks. There was even a social 
  life of sorts. A colonel in the I.P.K.F. once talked of having attended the 
  wedding of the L.T.T.E.'s Kumarappa, who committed suicide when he was about 
  to be transported to Colombo. At the wedding he had presented the bride with 
  a sari. He also reflected with some sadness on how the L.T.T.E. leaders used 
  to bring them gifts of prawns and other seafood, and went on to show photographs 
  taken on the beach where he was present. Amongst the L.T.T.E. leaders in the 
  photograph were Mahattaya and Kumarappa.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><b>2.3 Scenes from the October 1987 War</b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>In Karainagar, a crowd was watching the England Versus 
  India test cricket match on a television screen supplied by a generator, because 
  the electricity had been cut. The following day, 5 November, an Indian helicopter 
  shelled the area killing eleven persons. This raid seems to have been carried 
  out on the basis of the flimsy, uncorroborated speculation that passed for intelligence. 
  The shelling of Chavakachcheri town was similar. The town was shelled from an 
  Indian helicopter at mid-day on 27 October, 1987. The market area where the 
  shells fell was full of ordinary people and refugees from further north. According 
  to Mr. S.G. Deva, an eye-witness, there was nothing in the area at that time 
  to distinguish it as an L.T.T.E. target. Between twenty and forty persons were 
  killed. A dead mother was hugging her dead child and a piece of shrapnel had 
  entered through her body and pierced the child she was carrying. According to 
  a traveller who passed through Chavakachcheri market an hour before the aerial 
  shelling, he had seen a Datsun pick-up mounted with a 50 calibre machine gun 
  and armed L.T.T.E. men moving slowly through the market. He had remarked to 
  some friends that there would be trouble as an Indian observation helicopter 
  had been around. This however does not justify the action taken an hour later. 
  Refugees who were waiting to go south at Sangupitty jetty were fire-bombed from 
  a helicopter on 25 October. An eye-witness account appeared in the Sunday Times 
  of 1 November. It may be noted that refugees fleeing the Sri Lankan Army's &quot;Operation 
  Liberation&quot; in May 1987 were not molested in this way. A similar tragedy 
  overtook several people attempting to get across to the Islands from the Araly 
  jetty on 22 October. Seventeen were reported killed when boats carrying civilians 
  were fired upon from the air. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>On 3 November Mrs. Lily Rajah and three of her grandchildren, 
  two boys and a girl were shot dead while being taken by the I.P.K.F., in front 
  of the residence of the Solomons on the Maruthanamadam Road at Uduvil. There 
  had been no provocation. According to one source, an I.P.K.F. officer had shouted: 
  &quot;Stop it&quot;. But by then it was too late. The two sons-in-law of the 
  Solomons who had been called out were let off after the family pleaded on their 
  knees.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>From November onwards there were reported an increasing 
  number of cases of rape, molestation and theft, by men from the I.P.K.F.. When 
  soldiers were doing a search at Karanthan, near Urumpirai, they came upon a 
  house where all the occupants were women refugees. The soldiers closed the door 
  and spent up to an hour inside. This incident which took place on 16th November 
  was related by one of those involved, now living in Rakka Lane, Chundikuli. 
  She had been let off after pleading and crying on her knees. On 28th November 
  in Urumpirai north, a lone soldier went into a house where a girl was. The soldier 
  ran away when the mother and the neighbours started screaming. On 14 November, 
  a university student who had lost her mother and grandmother in Urumpirai when 
  they were shot by advancing I.P.K.F. troops, was being taken from Uduvil to 
  Jaffna by an uncle. At Manipay she stopped at a friend's place where the father, 
  mother and son were standing out, watched by two soldiers. The soldiers motioned 
  the girl to go inside and the uncle to stay out. Sensing what was in store, 
  the girl screamed. Her uncle asked everyone to join in the screaming. Some soldiers 
  rushed out of the house and the whole lot of them ran away. The girl of the 
  house had been twice raped by soldiers. She had been afraid to scream thinking 
  that the rest of the family would be shot. The son of the house, also a university 
  student, had been in a group of 20 boys who had been kicked and assaulted by 
  soldiers earlier that day. The son complained to an army captain in the area. 
  The captain replied: &quot;I am sorry. I take full responsibility for the incident. 
  We were angry after we went hunting for arms and did not find any. I ordered 
  the men to beat up some young men. They are disciplined. They only follow orders.&quot; 
  The girls have now left for Colombo.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>Major Parameswara Iyer who was the I.P.K.F. commandant 
  at Uduvil was widely regarded as a good man. He listened to the problems of 
  the people sympathetically and made a strong effort to maintain discipline. 
  On the morning of 25 November, he and three of his men were killed while on 
  a search in the Dutch Road area. the captain at Uduvil Girls' School, one Sharma, 
  was angry. The area was subject to shelling. Mr. Thanjaratnam, a pensioner, 
  was killed while riding his bicycle. Mr. Cameron, an old man above 70, wearing 
  a turban, was carrying a bottle of milk and had come to Uduvil junction to purchase 
  bread. He was shot dead. A mother who had been injured by the shelling was being 
  taken on a bicycle for medical treatment by her son. As they came up Ark Lane 
  onto the Uduvil-Manipay Road, they were shot at by the troops from Uduvil junction. 
  The mother died and the son escaped. A lady who is a teacher and member of the 
  Uduvil Church said that at least 12 civilians were killed on that day.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>A female student from the university who had been with 
  her grand-mother at Pandatheruppu had this to say: </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>&quot;There and in the neighbouring areas of Sandilipai 
  and Chankanai, people live in constant fear of shelling, assault and searches. 
  The L.T.T.E. goes to an area, fires a few shots and runs away. Then the I.P.K.F. 
  soldiers run amok. When the market was reopened, someone came and fired a shot 
  and ran away. The soldiers started beating people. One keerai (spinach) seller 
  was shot dead. During the first week of December, four I.P.K.F. men were shot 
  dead by the L.T.T.E. along the Sandilipai-Pandatheruppu road. A farmer working 
  in the paddy field was shot and injured by Indian troops. Neighbours took him 
  to the I.P.K.F. camps at Mathagal and Pandatheruppu for medical treatment and 
  were turned away. The farmer died. The next day, these I.P.K.F. camps were again 
  offering medical treatment to civilians.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&quot;We are in 
  fear of searches, when soldiers would suddenly jump into our compounds. During 
  one such search a soldier beat up the girl in the neighbouring house and forced 
  her into a room. The others in the house and we screamed. Another group of soldiers 
  arrived on the scene and the first lot ran away. The Colonel is apparently a 
  decent man. The miscreants were caught and court-martialled. My aunt in Pandatheruppu 
  too was once harassed by soldiers. But she stood firm. The Colonel told us that 
  this was a recurrent problem when the army was on exercises in remote Indian 
  villages. The army unit is normally moved away before complaints become too 
  many. The former Citizens' Committee from L.T.T.E. days has now been resurrected 
  under the I.P.K.F.. The Colonel told them of how he had been fired upon while 
  in the camp and showed some tiny bullets. He told them, &quot;You must put a 
  stop to this. I am considerate and did not do anything this time. The next time, 
  I will shell the place.&quot; The Citizens' Committee apologised profusely. 
  During an operation, I heard the Colonel ordering his men over the wireless. 
  He was telling them not to shoot anyone, but if necessary to give chase. But 
  I do not know how good such instructions will be when a trooper gets killed.&quot;</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>On the 7th November, Indian troops in Inuvil and Maruthanamadam 
  were tense as the result of reports of L.T.T.E. movements in that area. A tractor 
  carrying bags of rice for a refugee camp and coming from the west through a 
  lane, crossed the K.K.S. road a few yards south of Inuvil Hospital. In the process, 
  it knocked against an I.P.K.F. barrier and crossed into the lane opposite, going 
  east. The I.P.K.F. sentry at Maruthanamadam fired shells which went over the 
  hospital and fell near the lane. One fell on the house of a Prof. Chandrasegaram 
  who was sleeping under a table with his legs sticking out. His legs were badly 
  mangled. He was admitted to the hospital and died a few hours later.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>At Atchuvely, during the first week of November, some 
  L.T.T.E. members threw grenades at the I.P.K.F. and escaped through a Proctor 
  Balasingam's house. Two soldiers were killed. Soldiers entered Proctor Balasingam's 
  house and called out the Proctor, his wife and another person, who were helpless 
  parties in the matter. Subsequently all three were shot dead.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>Despite a publicly expressed wish by the Indian authorities 
  to restore normality, public service employees, hospital employees and University 
  employees get beaten up by Indian troops at Manipay, Sandilipay, Thavady, Uduvil 
  and Maruthanamadam as they report for work.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>On the night of 7 December, about thirty L.T.T.E. men 
  arrived at a small temple at Kondavil. The people of that area went to them 
  and asked them to leave, saying that their lives were going to be endangered. 
  The L.T.T.E. refused to leave. The people then replied that they were going 
  to inform the I.P.K.F.. The L.T.T.E. men replied: &quot;You need not bother, 
  we can do it ourselves&quot;. Saying this, they fired their guns into the air. 
  The people hurriedly left that area and went into temples. The newly arrived 
  troops surrounded the area in the morning. Some L.T.T.E. men who remained behind, 
  shot at the soldiers and ran away. Two soldiers were killed. That morning, some 
  C.T.B. (Ceylon Transport Board) workers were driving to work in a bus, towards 
  Kondavil depot, as a part of the effort by the Indian authorities to restore 
  normality. At Kondavil junction, the bus was stopped by soldiers and the driver 
  and conductor were very badly assaulted. Each time the wounded man groaned, 
  angry soldiers hammered the bus and broke some of its windows. The driver and 
  conductor thought they were finished, when, fortunately, an officer arrived 
  and asked the soldiers to call it off. During this ordeal, the remaining CTB 
  employees lay on the floor of the bus saying their prayers.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>That same night, Mr. Balasingam, the brother of Mr. Thuraisingam, 
  office assistant to the Vice-Chancellor, University of Jaffna, and his uncle 
  Mr. Kopalasingam remained behind in their home at Kondavil to safeguard it from 
  robbers, whilst others betook themselves to the temple. Soldiers came and called 
  them out. Mr. Balasingam was stabbed to death and Mr. Kopalasingam was admitted 
  to hospital with gunshot injuries. Mr. Balasingam had got married only a year 
  previously. Two other young men were summoned from the entrance to a temple 
  where they were standing and stabbed to death. In all six civilians were stabbed 
  to death that night.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>On that day (8 December), a local curfew was suddenly 
  imposed in a wide area stretching from Inuvil to Kopay at 11.00 a.m. Many who 
  went to work or to buy essentials in town suddenly found themselves stuck in 
  the middle of nowhere. Knowing that their families would have a sleepless night 
  if they did not return, they made risky detours through country lanes avoiding 
  the main roads. A typical experience was that of Mr. Murugavel's, the University 
  Librarian, who had to get back home to Erlalai: &quot;We were going north along 
  Rajapathai when I saw some people rushing towards me, going south. We stopped 
  to ask what the matter was. They rushed past me without stopping. Suddenly gun 
  shots started whizzing past us. We turned our bicycles around and hooked it. 
  We then went east, crossed Pt. Pedro Road and went north through lanes in order 
  to avoid the army sentries at Irupalai and Kopay. We crossed the Kopay - Kaithadi 
  Road at a point 300 yards east of the Kopay sentry and got into another lane. 
  Further down, we headed west, crossing the Pt. Pedro Road and went towards Puttur 
  along a lane. We then got to Erlalai by travelling along the Puttur - Chunnakam 
  Road.&quot; These are the conditions of normality under which thousands report 
  for work!</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>On 27 November, Mr. Gananathan was going from Sandilipay 
  towards Jaffna when he was stopped by the army sentry at the Kattudai irrigation 
  channel and was asked to join a party of nine others in the channel, standing 
  waist deep in water. Amongst the party were 3 girls and a pensioner who had 
  taken advantage of the I.P.K.F.'s &quot;normality&quot; to go to Jaffna and 
  collect his pension. The pensioner tried to plead his case, only to be by the 
  soldiers: &quot;We are dying and you want you pension eh!&quot; They were told 
  further that a party of thirty soldiers had gone looking for the L.T.T.E. and 
  if anyone of them came to harm, they would all be killed. Gun shots were periodically 
  fired into the water above and around them. Gananathan, who had on a previous 
  occasion got to know one of the Sikh soldiers at the Sandilipay sentry point, 
  tried appealing to him: &quot;You are my friend.&quot; &quot;You are not my 
  friend today,&quot; came the reply. Someone from the I.P.K.F. inquired over 
  the wireless as to what was happening. &quot;There is a queue waiting for rice&quot;, 
  replied one of the soldiers. All seemed to enjoy the little joke. The party 
  was let off after 45 minutes. During that interval they had appealed to all 
  the gods in the pantheon. Eleven I.P.K.F. soldiers were killed in that area 
  the following day when they surrounded a party of the L.T.T.E..</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><b>2.4 Encounters with Indians during the 
  War</b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>Our reports suggest that in encounters between civilians 
  and officers, the latter were frequently arrogant and over-bearing. There was 
  little effort to face up to where things had gone wrong. Civilians were often 
  hectored and bullied and the civilians merely swallowed their feelings. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>On the other hand we have met some young, reflective 
  officers who have displayed intelligence, courtesy and a desire to learn more 
  about problems here by listening to civilians. One such person was a young Major. 
  He recognised that women had a problem and had spread the word encouraging them 
  to scream if they sensed danger. In all cases that we have heard of, this has 
  worked. He had noted in his diary the Tamil words for, &quot;come out, do not 
  be afraid.&quot; He told us that he had been in town during the advance, and 
  when people had expressed an inability to move to camps, he had advised them 
  to close up and stay inside. Having known him, we believe he was telling the 
  truth.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>A common belief amongst the Indian officers is that they 
  were engaged in a full scale war. Many of the officers were brought in, after 
  hostilities broke out, with little or no knowledge of the complexities of the 
  situation they faced. They were simply ordered to take Jaffna and they went 
  according to their books as if they were facing a highly sophisticated standing 
  army. The enemy was in fact a group of 2,000 teenagers, fighting in any manner 
  they could improvise, caring as little about civilian lives. By available accounts 
  the Indian force consisted of over 20,000 men, supported by tanks and artillery. 
  Some officers confessed that they had to come here in a hurry after picking 
  up something of the situation from Front Line magazine and from Tamil friends.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>A Major attached to the Gurkha Regiment stationed near 
  Thirunelvely, explained to some members of the University staff: &quot;The Gurkhas 
  form the most disciplined regiment in the Indian Army. Last night (14th December) 
  we heard some firing from the Thirunelvely colony. I ordered my men to hold 
  their fire and to shoot only if they saw someone shooting at them. I know that 
  the L.T.T.E. was given to such provocation in the hope that several civilians 
  would be killed during reprisals.&quot;</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>At least one Major in the Gurkha regiment was intelligent 
  enough to understand the L.T.T.E.'s strategy. He understood that all that is 
  required of the L.T.T.E. to rattle the I.P.K.F. and to obstruct any semblance 
  of normality is to fire a few shots and run away. As a pre-condition for normality, 
  the I.P.K.F. must first make up its mind as to whether it is going to be a real 
  peace keeping force or an undisciplined army. When the Indian Army undertook 
  the peace keeping role, it should have been prepared to sustain casualties. 
  But taking reprisals against civilians on sustaining casualties has become the 
  normal thing. An exception was when two soldiers from the Madras regiment were 
  killed in Chunnakam, on the 14th of December. The I.P.K.F. has such a low regard 
  for the civilian population, that reprisals against civilians are not taken 
  seriously. We do not know of any soldier being court-martialled for killing 
  unarmed civilians. A casual attitude to civilian deaths certainly emanates from 
  the top. A top ranking military official was questioned about the shelling of 
  the civilian population. He said: &quot;I have not used shelling in my area. 
  But if this situation continues, I will have to think about it.&quot;</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>It has been evident that many soldiers from Tamil Nadu 
  have found what was happening here too much to stomach. A Jawan once said: &quot;You 
  should see the destruction at Urumpirai and Kopay. Hundreds of innocent civilians 
  have been killed. But the Tigers have escaped. Be careful, the northerners are 
  in a bilious mood.&quot; Here he was referring to the North Indians in the I.P.K.F.. 
  A touching piece of advice came from an army officer from Tamil Nadu who took 
  a respected member of the community aside and poured out what had been bothering 
  him. He said: &quot;If you have been in Jaffna town, you would not know the 
  full extent of the hardships suffered by the people. You should go towards Urumpirai 
  and see what has happened. Innocent people have been killed by the hundreds. 
  We officers understand the problem independently of whether they are Tamil of 
  not. The Jawans are from all over India, from different cultures and are very 
  ignorant. They do not know a Tamil from a Sinhalese. For them, even a 5 year 
  old child is a Tiger. If one shot is fired they will fire a round. If one of 
  them is killed, they will simply kill ten civilians. It is only now that we 
  are trying to conduct some lectures and are trying to explain the situation 
  to them. I am so tired. I wish to resign from the army in four months' time.&quot;</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>The community leader tried to comfort him by telling 
  him that the Tamils had also suffered from the actions of the Sri Lankan Army. 
  The officer waved his hand and shook his head. He said, &quot;An army is an 
  army. All armies are the same. The Indian Army is the world's most undisciplined 
  army. One thing I can tell you is that, now that the I.P.K.F. is here, the people 
  will have to choose between the I.P.K.F. and the L.T.T.E., and you cannot get 
  the Indian Army out by shooting. If the L.T.T.E. shoots one, the Indian Army 
  will shoot ten. If you must protest, as you should, bring a hundred thousand 
  people and have a demonstration. But avoid shooting at all costs.&quot;</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><b>2.5 A Personal Assessment</b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>Perhaps, the following comment from a university lecturer 
  in medicine offers something towards understanding the present crisis: </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>&quot;I think the whole psychology of the Indian Army 
  changed following the landing of commandos at Thirunelvely on 12 October. That 
  was an area where there was a high concentration of L.T.T.E. men and the L.T.T.E. 
  was able to mobilise effectively. Having spurned air-cover (which the Sri Lankans 
  never did), the commandos suffered an unexpected reverse. Up to about that time 
  the Indian Army showed concern for civilian life. Around then a convoy of Indian 
  troops came past my house. They were at ease and were waving at civilians. The 
  L.T.T.E. fired at the convoy and my own house became a battle ground. I had 
  to flee with a lady and children who were with me. We were at first fired upon 
  and, later, when they realised that were were not L.T.T.E. men, we were allowed 
  to walk away unharmed. The army asked the people in the next house to come out 
  with their hands up. But when they came out, an L.T.T.E. boy sneaked up behind 
  them and fired at the army. The officer shouted asking them to get inside the 
  house and allowed them time to do so before opening fire. There was a very real 
  sense in which the L.T.T.E. was using civilian cover. But not in the crude sense 
  claimed by All India Radio. During that experience, the Indian Army displayed 
  concern for civilian life.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>&quot;Then I feel the psychology changed and there was 
  a deliberate decision to use terror. The intensity of killing at Urumpirai a 
  week later was very different from what I had experienced. Shelling a large 
  army concentrated behind a battle front is understandable. But in our context, 
  with a small thinly spread out guerrilla force, shelling becomes a weapon of 
  terror. It all leaves a bad taste. The Indian Army may have been disorganised 
  in many things. But the suspicion that there was a deliberate decision to terrorize 
  is reinforced by a remarkable consistency in the threats made. It became common-place 
  for different companies of officers and Jawans to say things like, &quot;I will 
  shoot you&quot; or &quot;I will flatten this place.&quot; It was a tragic step 
  for Mahatma Gandhi's India.&quot;</span> <a href="#top">[Top]</a></p>
