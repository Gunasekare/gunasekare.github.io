font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'></span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The open fields around 
  Jaffna make a wondrous sight during the early months of the year. Just such 
  a field lies three miles to the east of the city, marking two miles of open 
  space extending up to the lagoon that separates Valikamam from Thenmaratchi. 
  January saw the fields lush green with newly grown rice. Its canals, filled 
  with water during the rainy season contain riches for an enthusiastic bird watcher. 
  Wild duck, kingfisher, stork and some less common species are all there. One 
  can watch with fascination as a duck glides in the air, nose-dives into the 
  water and comes out with a wriggling fish in its beak. As the month wears on, 
  the stalks turn golden as the rice ripens. Amidst all this beauty, one has to 
  learn to ignore the rusting bodies of cast-away motor vehicles. Jaffna is an 
  orphaned city. There are no city fathers. Faceless men come and go. They build 
  anywhere. They dump rubbish anywhere.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>If you miss the scene for two 
  weeks, by mid-February an entirely different scene greets your eyes. The green 
  is no more. The fields are strewn with newly mown hay, a haystack in every square. 
  Gusts of the northeasterly wind carry the voices of women who are threshing 
  the rice. This time the fields are filled with other kinds of birds, including 
  the common sparrow and the seven sisters, scavenging for left over grains. A 
  solitary dog goes about savouring new smells. Against the reddening glow of 
  the setting sun families walk home, their work done, carrying baskets filled 
  with tiffin carriers, water bottles and thermos flasks. They are in no hurry 
  to beat the curfew. A huge, lone bird with a long beak and of light brown hue 
  reposes in an air of meditation befitting the solemn eve. The nesting songs 
  of a multitude of feathery denizens, hymn the descent of night. Next, it will 
  be the turn of cattle. A morning caller will relish the joyous sight of new 
  born calves frisking in the sun.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>The coming of the southeast monsoon 
  by the middle of the year will see the same fields thronged with children flying 
  kites. When we were children, there used to be an old labourer who could make 
  ten kinds of kite and would readily oblige children. He is gone now. Some of 
  his sons, they say, went to West Germany. We had little time for such things 
  since we were past the leisure of childhood. We were busy becoming accountants, 
  doctors, engineers and as the last resort, that underrated underdog, the school 
  teacher. With all their liabilities, social and economic, they must carry the 
  burden of responsibility for what the ancient Greeks called &quot;arete&quot; 
  (all round excellence) of generations to come. When one looks back on the benign 
  influences on one's life, one may easily think of a self-effacing school teacher 
  or spiritual mentor who acts as a spring of lucid water, unseen of the eye. 
  But seldom would one think of a doctor, an engineer or an accountant. Today 
  even children do not have time for such things. Well bred children are taught 
  early in life to say: &quot;I am busy&quot;. Our educational system is one huge 
  edifice on the Gradgrind model, immortalised by Charles Dickens in &quot;Hard 
  Times&quot;. We brought forth far too few men who were historians, men of originality 
  or men of vision. Having paid the price, the hangover from four years of war 
  has given us plenty of time to reflect, to notice those things we chose not 
  to see. The only busy ones are those applying for foreign visas.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>It is often said that Jaffna 
  is back forty years in time. Whether that is good or bad is a matter of personal 
  taste. One sense in which that is true is that the bulls are back in business. 
  The old Dutch Road linking Uduvil and Sandilipay is a scene of striking beauty 
  right round the year. The younger lads will of course prefer the beauties at 
  Uduvil Girls' College where Dutch Road begins, provided irate fathers wielding 
  walking sticks are not around to intercept letters passed over the wall. Those 
  with a reflective turn of mind could go further down where the only reminders 
  of present times are tall electric pylons and military helicopters plying between 
  Jaffna Fort and Palaly. Some passers by stopped to see the sight that was considered 
  abolished -- a man who was ploughing with bulls. He stopped and inquired what 
  they were looking at. &quot;We were wondering at what you are doing&quot;, they 
  replied. &quot;Oh, that&quot;, he said, and smiled, putting up his hand to shade 
  his eyes from the rays of the morning sun. He continued: &quot;Only the big 
  farmers can afford tractors now. The fuel charges are prohibitive. Give me two 
  good bulls and I can plough half an acre in 3 hours flat.&quot;</p>

</span> 
<p style='text-align:justify;'><b>8.2 The South</b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'>Over a year the country lost two of its most promising 
  national leaders, Mr. Sarath Muttetuwegama, the Communist Party member of parliament 
  and Mr. Vijaya Kumaranatunge, leader of the Sri Lanka People's Party. Their 
  significance was that while they addressed the majority Sinhalese constituency, 
  they articulated the grievances of all the people in Ceylon - including the 
  Tamil minority and the Sinhalese poor. Few with a mass following have done it 
  since 1956 with so much honesty, effect and conviction. The first died in a 
  motoring accident and the latter was killed on 14 February, 1988 by a killer 
  from the J.V.P. (Jathika Vimukthi Peramuna). Two other national leaders who 
  died since the July 1983 anti-Tamil violence are Bishops Lakshman Wickremasinghe 
  (Anglican) and Leo Nanayakkara (Roman Catholic), both of whom were widely respected 
  throughout the country. Undoubtedly it was men like the bishops who paved the 
  way for the political leaders named above. The story of Bishop Lakshman's intellectual 
  journey was one of how difficult it was for a man from an educated middle class 
  Sinhalese family to break out of the assumptions of Sinhalese nationalism. An 
  unwholesome trend that has sprung up in the South is that many intellectuals 
  are not reflecting on their role which resulted in the crisis that hovers over 
  the entire country. But they are rather given over to glee over the fate of 
  the Tamils during the Indian army's progress in the last months of 1987. They 
  occupy themselves trying to prove how Tamils may have fared better if the Sri 
  Lankan army had been allowed to do the job. Having had little to say during 
  the 4 years of bloodletting, gestures of sympathy for the Tamils have followed 
  the Indian offensive. There are of course many in the South, perhaps fewer in 
  the North, who have been unwavering in the cause of justice to all, Tamils, 
  Muslims and Sinhalese. Papers in the South which branded as terrorist anyone 
  who spoke about the atrocities of the Sri Lankan army, seemed to be suddenly 
  telling the truth. Publicity was given to statements by the afflicted, who in 
  their anger said things like: &quot;The Sri Lankan Army is much better than 
  the Indian Army,&quot; and to those who have called the Indian Army a &quot;beggar 
  army&quot;. The fact is that both armies behaved badly. Though the Colombo papers 
  did not say it, the Sri Lankan Army too, had indulged in widespread murder, 
  rape and looting. The pre-occupation with Indian bashing is yet another manifestation 
  of the destructive face of Sinhalese nationalism. </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>Those who formerly supported 
  the militarism of the government are the very ones who are now angry with the 
  government for having harvested the fruits of this militarism - namely India's 
  role in this country's affairs. This anger has now turned into blind sympathy 
  for the J.V.P., simply because the J.V.P. is anti-India, anti-government and 
  is shooting. The J.V.P. also receives sympathy from a group of intellectuals 
  who having imbibed the mish-mash of liberation ideologies and tend to sympathise 
  with any gun-toting group that styles itself a liberation movement. In their 
  view, which is based on a few external factors, the J.V.P. represents the legitimate 
  aspirations of the Sinhalese people, just as the L.T.T.E. did those of the Tamils.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>In a real sense the J.V.P. is 
  logical extension of the Sinhalese chauvinism of the mainline parties. The J.V.P. 
  (popularly known as the Che Guavera movement in 1971) launched a rebellion against 
  the government of Mrs. Bandaranaike's in 1971 which was brutally suppressed 
  within six weeks. In this period, an estimated 15,000 Sinhalese youths were 
  killed. Its leaders were released from prison by the new Jayewardene government 
  in 1977 and the party was legitimised. Although this received general approval, 
  subsequently there was widespread feeling that, given the intransigent nature 
  of the J.V.P., this was also a Machiavellian move by the ruling U.N.P. to split 
  the votes of the left parties (S.L.F.P., L.S.S.P., C.P., and N.S.S.P.). True 
  to the government's cynical and unprincipled form, when it was accused by the 
  international community of responsibility for violence against Tamils in July 
  1983, it tried to turn the blame on three of the left parties, the C.P., N.S.S.P., 
  and the J.V.P.. All were banned. The ban on the J.V.P. remained. Its leaders 
  including Rohana Wijeweera who contested the 1982 presidential elections, went 
  underground. The attempt to find scapegoats did not stick. The ban on the C.P. 
  and the N.S.S.P., which had taken an anti-racist stand, was lifted. If the J.V.P. 
  had participated in the 1983 race riot, it was under a smoke screen provided 
  by the government itself. The J.V.P. had little opportunity while the government 
  pursued a military approach to the Tamils. The J.V.P. was to have its opportunity, 
  however, when the government faced the necessary consequences of its actions 
  and bowed to India's wishes.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>The other source of strength 
  to the J.V.P. is the failure of the left parties as a result of their own inadequacies, 
  together with the government's repression. By 1980, the government's open economic 
  policies resulted in a high inflation rate. The worker dissatisfaction led to 
  the general strike that year. The strike was put down with widespread use of 
  thuggery and 40,000 dismissals. Mr. Cyril Mathew, then Minister for Industries 
  and the then Prime Minister Premadasa, who is now the President, were widely 
  associated with the goon squads which made their appearance again in July 1983 
  against Tamils. The helplessness of the Left in the face of the failure of the 
  general strike resulted in its humiliation and a Pyrrhic victory for the government. 
  The J.V.P. thus stands to acquire the mantle of being anti-India, ant- Tamil, 
  anti-government and pro- socialist, all at once. Considerable sympathy results 
  for the J.V.P. not from its ability to do anything constructive, but simply 
  because it warms hearts by shooting at policemen and politicians and becoming, 
  thus, the Sinhalese people's vicarious avenger. This is in many ways similar 
  to the support the militant groups, especially the L.T.T.E., gained amongst 
  Tamils who were smarting under the humiliations inflicted on them by the government. 
  After the July 1983 violence a catch phrase amongst Tamil expatriates used to 
  be, &quot;I will give money to whoever hammers hardest and gives us action.&quot;

<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>Where the use of English has 
  declined and wholesome alternative reading in the local languages is hard to 
  come by, opportunities abound for charlatans within and without the universities 
  who can throw around some big words and big names from the West. The arduous 
  journey from Marxism to fascism which was performed for the L.T.T.E. by Anton 
  Balasingam, is now being performed for the benefit of the J.V.P. in the South. 
  Writing in Sinhalese, one southern intellectual has said that just as Newtonian 
  Physics was rendered false by Einsteinian Physics, which in turn was rendered 
  false by Quantum mechanics; the Western philosophy of Marxism has now been out-moded. 
  It would hardly be surprising if in its dialectical turn around, the J.V.P. 
  is now preparing to cut off its vestigial links with Marxism and incorporate 
  some Buddhist symbolism.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>Many would agree that the main 
  problem facing this country is the frustration created by a lack of democracy. 
  The forms of it which exist today are too crude, and the holders of power too 
  crass for the system to give redress to small groups with legitimate grievances. 
  Faced with the potent menace of its own creation, the government with no new 
  ideas left has resorted to the same methods that failed against Tamils. The 
  Special Task Force (S.T.F.) which was created by President Jayawardene's son 
  Ravi and trained by former S.A.S. men from Britain, for use against Tamils, 
  is now deployed against the J.V.P. in the deep South. No one is talking about 
  the scale of disappearances. When dealing with Tamils at least, the government 
  had to look over its shoulder at both India and international opinion. Since 
  repression in Tamil areas descended slowly and because the people believed they 
  had a cause, several active groups had been able successfully to mobilise popular 
  resistance until early 1983.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>The Sinhalese community now 
  faces a grievous danger, both from their collective failure to deal justly with 
  the Tamils and their own disaffected sections. The ruling class has wallowed 
  in ill-gotten money, while the rural poor had been militarised and sent as cannon 
  fodder in a much praised campaign to subdue the Tamils militarily. They had 
  been sent as troopers, homeguards, and colonists into Tamil areas, and then 
  precipitately abandoned when India entered the scene. </p>

&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>8.3 The Press </span></b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sections of the press in 
  Colombo at least seem to have begun regretting their silence over what the government 
  did to the Tamil population. An abortive change seemed to be coming in January 
  1987 when Colomo's newspaper, The Island, made a departure from the normal practice 
  of quoting official handouts, by giving publicity to a statement by a senior 
  citizen in Batticaloa on the S.T.F. action in Kokkadichholai that resulted in 
  scores of civilian deaths. As the war seemed to be getting in for a stalemate, 
  Colombo's Sunday Island published interviews with national leaders where the 
  questioning was more strident. But the cover up of the dirty war continued. 
  Take for example the Sri Lankan Army's shelling of Jaffna town and its hospital 
  on 7 March 1987 which resulted in 17 deaths. Unlike Juliet Ricks who reported 
  for the BBC, Lucian Rajakarunayake who came to Jaffna to report for the Sunday 
  Island (report on 22 March, 1987), found no evidence of the incident while many 
  of the injured were still in hospital. He instead referred to the &quot;alleged 
  incident&quot; in a dismissive manner. The Press in Colombo reflected the euphoria 
  in the South when government forces took control of Vadamaratchi in June 1987. 
  This reached a high pitch when the flotilla of Indian Red Cross relief vessels 
  meekly turned back after interception by the Sri Lankan Navy. The commanding 
  naval officer, in words that reflected popular Sinhalese prejudices about India, 
  asked the Indians to give the food to their own starving people. Colombo was 
  awash with drinking parties joined in by the press. Then came the Indian airdrop 
  of relief supplies on 4 June ,1987 and all the euphoria and bravado of the politicians 
  vanished without trace. Since then the press has taken on a somewhat chastised 
  tone. The article in Colombo's Weekend of 19 July 1987, by Kumudini Hettiarachchi, 
  trying to tell the Sinhalese how dangerously out of tune they are with the rest 
  of the world in seeing this crisis, has been referred to in Vol I, Ch. 8. There 
  was a general feeling that this country's official information outlets such 
  as Lankapuwath, which had been tamely quoted by the press, had brought on the 
  Sinhalese infamy and ridicule rather than straightening their image. In January 
  1988, Colombo's Sunday Times broke new ground by reporting that the Sri Lankan 
  Police had been responsible for a reprisal in Batticaloa where civilians were 
  killed. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>In their minds at least those 
  in the South had begun to think of the North and East as an alien land. But 
  how does the press in the South that had voluntarily worn the yoke of cowardice 
  and falsehood, respond to a situation where the violence had come home ? There 
  was no escape from the bloody schism within. Their own gut instincts too had 
  let them down. Old habits are hard to break. Yet the press in Colombo is not 
  without signs of hope. </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>Although there is much published 
  in Colombo now about the goings on in the North, one gathers that the subject 
  of disappearances in the South is one that is hard to write about. There was 
  one remarkable interview in the Sunday Island (21 February, 1988) with Mr. Ravi 
  Jayewardene, son of and security advisor to President Jayewardene.The interview 
  by Lasantha Wickrematunge in which Ravi Jayewardene was queried about the S.T.F. 
  which he fathered is remarkable for containing more information in the questions 
  rather than in the answers. Here are some excerpts: </p>

<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Question: 
  The S.T.F. is identified with the &quot;Green Tigers'&quot; activities in the 
  South. What is the extent of S.T.F. involvement with the &quot;Green Tigers&quot; 
  especially with stories relating to the disappearance of a large number of youths? 
  </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Answer: 
  None. Frankly I do not know what the &quot;Green Tigers&quot; is and who runs 
  it...... the S.T.F. will have no involvement with them at all. They are a highly 
  disciplined force and I cannot imagine them committing atrocities. </span></p>

  How do you think people have got confused and the accusations are made against 
  the S.T.F.? </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Answer: 
  I know how this mistake has been made. Many units in camouflage uniforms have 
  been deployed today by the police and other organisations in all parts of the

</span> 
<p class=MsoBodyText><span> </span>The choice of the name &quot;Green 
  Tigers&quot; for the semi-official hit squad is a genuflection in the direction 
  of the government's erstwhile foe, the L.T.T.E.. The answers by Ravi Jayewardene 
  are an admission that there is something afoot in the South that the government 
  ought to be ashamed of. From the absence of the details of disappearances appearing 
  in the press, one gathers that the press is either not privy to, or is reluctant 
  to publish such information. In this at least Mr.S. Sivanayagam and Mr. Gamini 
  Navaratne, who in turn edited the weekly &quot;Saturday Review&quot; from Jaffna 
  must remain pioneers. They sought and published details of human rights violations 
  in the North and East, as well as information passed on to them from the South. 
  (One might say the Saturday Review said too little on such violations by militant 
  groups. Still what it said was much more than what others were willing to say). 
  This is a sure sign that the Prevention of Terrorism Act that was meant for 
  the Tamils has, as predicted, come to roost in the South. To survive under the 
  P.T.A., an editor needs a feeling, as well as guts, for the game of going to 
  the brink and taking risks. No editor in Colombo will probably be allowed that 
  opportunity. </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>With public men in Colombo 
  under threat of being murdered, journalists will no doubt feel themselves threatened 
  sooner or later. However one does find in the South a greater willingness by 
  several people to take a stand against extremists than one found in the North 
  against militant excesses. One reason for this is that the J.V.P. did not come 
  to be seen as the legitimate voice of the Sinhalese people in the way that militant 
  groups came to be seen as the voice of the Tamil people. Thus the resulting 
  confusion amongst Tamils was greater. We give an extract from an article in 
  the Sunday Times of 21 February, 1987, by Qadri Ismail, on the subject of the 
  murder of Vijaya Kumaranatunge by the J.V.P.: </p>
<span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";"Times New Roman";'><br clear=all style='page-break-before:auto;

</span> 
<p style='text-align:justify;'>&quot;By killing him the J.V.P. can no longer pretend 
  that it is not a racist organisation -- let alone a democratic one. This was 
  known by all but the wilfully blind many months ago. The J.V.P. has now proved 
  something else: that they do not intend to capture power by convincing the 
  people of the superiority of their ideas. They do not have any. They intend 
  to capture power by silencing all those with ideas. Then the only thing left 
  may be the J.V.P. - and its guns; for the only option left for Wijeweera now 
  is to kill all those standing in his way -- even if some of them are now his 
  allies and sympathisers. The gentleman in Sri Lankan politics has been killed 
  for the crime of threatening to unite his country.&quot;</p>
<span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";"Times New Roman";'><br clear=all style='page-break-before:auto;
'>
</span> 
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>While the government is seen 
  to be blundering along with democratic opinion unable to bring it to account, 
  the J.V.P. may receive a good deal of blind sympathy, even from those who abhor 
  its actions. A stage may be reached where fear will prevent the voicing of honest 
  opinion. More and more people in the South are becoming silent on learning that 
  they are on the J.V.P.'s hit list or are under suspicion by the forces of the 
  state. The Tamils went through a similar process. Up to July 1983 it was possible 
  for those with some courage and a popular base to criticise fascist tendencies 
  in the militant groups. With the blind surge of popularity for the militants 
  and the material support they received from India after the July '83 violence 
  against Tamils, all voices of reason ceased and consciences became hard. Anyone 
  who criticised the actions of militants was branded a traitor and soon pushed 
  to the wall. </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>In such confrontations, with 
  the state failing to maintain high standards of humanity in its conduct, each 
  side tends to seek the compliance of the populace through terror. When the methods 
  of liberation groups are seen to be utterly deplorable, the state obtains legitimacy, 
  both local and international, to unleash its capacity for unlimited terror. 
  The legacy of the J.V.P. and the L.T.T.E. must be seen in this context. In the 
  coming times, the press is bound to face extremely difficult times as well as 
  opportunities to be creative.</p>

  Editor of the Calcutta Telegraph, published in Colombo's Sunday Times of 14 
  February, 1987, from all we are able to gather, gives a fair insight into the 
  thinking of the Indian elite that governs the presence of Indian forces in Sri 
  Lanka. After referring to the humanitarian nature of India's original involvement 
  (to help the Tamils protect themselves from Lanka's army), he quite rightly 
  points out the danger inherent in creating new countries in India's neighbourhood 
  (in this case Tamil Eelam): </span></p>
<span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";"Times New Roman";'><br clear=all style='page-break-before:auto;

<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;The 
  Anandpur Sahib Resolution, in which lies the genesis of the demand for Khalistan 
  (just as the genesis of Pakistan lies in the Lahore Resolution), was conceived 
  within months of Bangladesh being created. Let us have no illusion that a number 
  of such resolutions would have sprung up also within months of creating another 
  country in Lanka and that if we would ever manage to do so. A new flag anywhere 
  in the world is a dangerous thing: it breeds new ideas...... We have no option 
  except to seek protection of our own interests within the framework of a united 
  Sri Lanka. Once we accept that we must also accept the consequence: the price 
  we must pay is to guarantee the unity of the country, more particularly because 
  we played no little role in creating the Tiger's capacity to challenge Lanka's 
  integrity. It is in a sense fortunate that the Lankan army proved incapable 
  of breaking the Tigers, for otherwise we would have had a permanently entrenched 
  hostile neighbour as in Pakistan.&quot;</span></p>

  long do you think it would have taken for small boats to start ferrying arms 
  into India to help insurrectionist groups to continue their wars against the 
  Indian state? There is no shortage of such groups. The Naxalites, I am certain 
  would welcome an infusion of arms to fight their wars of liberation in Andhra 
  Pradesh, Bengal and Bihar..... Let us not delude ourselves that another Punjab 
  cannot happen..... Would someone in Pakistan not like, for instance, to arm 
  a Muslim extremist group in Hyderabad or Naxalites in Andhra? Or who knows which 
  future secessionist in Tamil Nadu? Or simply fuel normal communal tensions which 
  bedevil us?&quot; </span></p>
<span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";"Times New Roman";'><br clear=all style='page-break-before:auto;
'>
</span> 
<p style='text-align:justify;'>What emerges is a preoccupation with national security 
  not dissimilar to that of the Sri Lankan government. One question the Indian 
  elite do not ask is why these secessionist tendencies arise ? What are the genuine 
  problems of regions that ought to be met by democratic accommodation ? Even 
  token acts of statesmanship seem to founder -- such as the fate of the Akali 
  Dhal -- because of a lack of commitment by the centre, a lack of trust, and 
  a cynicism that comes from trying to be clever. It seems so, casually natural 
  for them to arm the Tigers when it suits them on the humanitarian grounds of 
  protecting Tamils, and then to talk of fighting them on grounds of national 
  interests and bash the Tamils in the process. Starting from Bhindranwale, similar 
  tales of desultory cynicism lie behind many of India's problems. When the Indian 
  ruling class finds itself in a corner after the calculations of the experts 
  had failed, the policy changes in effect to one of sending in the C.R.P.F. 
  in the hope that once bashed hard enough, people would come round. Then come 
  the tales of torture disappearances and the like on the one hand, and what seems 
  a long lasting terrorist problem on the other. The Indian elite did not tire 
  of lecturing the Sri Lankan government on the need for a political solution 
  to the ethnic problem, but they themselves lacked the moral grit and honesty 
  to apply their advice at home. </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>The fathers of Indian 
  independence had the strength of basic humanity and some commitment to democracy, 
  although their self-righteousness was not always sustainable. The present ruling 
  class annoyingly sports the latter without the corresponding moral underpinning. 
  Having fought the British for their independence, the Indian elite is in danger 
  of forming a cruder form of polity than what the British left behind. The trouble 
  is that much Indian discussion on security matters is done by technocratic minds 
  that are very erudite and have imbibed the latest and smartest in geopolitics. 
  This leads to a natural substitution of the military for common morality in 
  approaching problems. It boosts their sense of personal vanity to think of themselves 
  as a Henry Kissinger - like maestros moving military presences and bargaining 
  chips here and there. The smell of decaying flesh and the sights of misery are 
  far away from their limousines and air-conditioned offices. It is easy for them 
  to forget that they too are mortals. </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>Except for those who are 
  too clever to see it, it is idle to pretend that means do not matter, however 
  desirable the ends. Just as the L.T.T.E.'s Anuradhapura massacre of Sinhalese 
  came back home in the form of open indifference to Tamil lives, and the Sri 
  Lankan S.T.F.'s methods in Tamil areas and the generally violent approach to 
  the Tamil problem resulted in a climate of arbitrary killing in the South. The 
  callousness of methods used by India in Sri Lanka will create in India itself 
  a mental and moral climate where the same methods look legitimate. </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>If free media coverage 
  of the I.P.K.F.'s activities in Jaffna had been permitted, in place of official 
  lying which brought discredit on India, much good would have been achieved. 
  It would have also helped to control some of the cruder military minds of the 
  kind which attempted to close the Uthayan newspaper premises on 11 October, 
  1987 by shelling its neighbourhood near Kailasapillayer Kovil, killing 13 civilians 
  in the process.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>Indians cannot evade responsibility 
  for what their soldiers did in Sri Lanka by simply giving discourses on military 
  psychology. While their politicians seem ignorant, their military top brass 
  talk of how their hearts bleed for the distress of the Tamil people and go on 
  to explain murder and rape in terms of the psychology of the soldier and battle 
  fatigue. One could see that they are unrepentant about what has happened and 
  about the ugly things that still happen. It will be apparent to a reader of 
  the events described that there is much more to them than the psychology of 
  the soldier - namely incompetence and callousness at the top, both political 
  and military.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>Such excuses will not 
  do for a country which had not tired of lecturing the Sri Lankan government 
  on the atrocious conduct of its army. India did not and would not accept explanations 
  in terms of the psychology of the Sinhalese soldier, who, like the Indian soldier, 
  could be a charming fellow at other times. </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>To our knowledge, not 
  one Indian soldier has been tried for human rights violations, of which there 
  are many. Bruised prisoners are routinely seen in public as if that was the 
  natural course of things. Several who were taken in by the Indian Army have 
  not re-appeared. That is also the natural order of things for which apologies 
  are considered unnecessary. Perhaps Indian hearts bleed for the tragedy of the 
  suffering universe without being able to relate it to flesh and blood individuals.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>Every British outrage 
  since the Amritsar massacre of 1919, every lathi blow, and every hour spent 
  in prison, has been counted as forming the anvil on which the Indian nation 
  was nobly forged. Sir Chimanlal Setalvad, a member of the Hunter Committee that 
  was appointed to investigate the incident, estimated that about 400 unarmed 
  Punjabi's were gunned down at Jallianwall Bagh during the Baisakhi festival 
  of April 1919. The British Army too had its psychology. It had a mutiny complex 
  after the Indian mutiny of 1857 which made them excessively anxious about crowds. 
  If human failings could be offered as excuses, there is no need for the law, 
  the cornerstone of civilised life. The British who, to their credit, were at 
  least conscious of their obligation to the law, did not offer such excuses. 
  A committee of inquiry headed by Lord Hunter was appointed. Mahatma Gandhi who 
  had trusted the British in the same manner that Tamils of Sri Lanka had trusted 
  India, was dismayed by the incident at Amritsar. When the Hunter report was 
  published it struck Gandhi as being little better than &quot;thinly disguised 
  whitewash&quot; and went on to ask if there was some secret code of conduct 
  governing the official class in India &quot;before which the flower of the great 
  British nation fell prostrate.&quot; (Mahatma Gandhi, by B.R Nanda, Unwin Books). 
  That still did not amount to total dismissal.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>The Tamils of Sri Lanka 
  have witnessed many more than 400 deaths of un-armed non-combatant civilians 
  resulting from Indian fire in what was to have been a disarming operation. Many 
  of those deaths resulted from clumsy indifference by what was said to be the 
  disciplined and competent forces of a great nation. No commission of inquiry 
  has been appointed, even if just to let the Indian parliament know what happened. 
</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>If India is serious about 
  the values of civilisation and the rule of the law, it is no good talking about 
  the provocative conduct of the L.T.T.E. and the anger of the soldiers. The civilians 
  too were angry, angry with both the L.T.T.E. and the Indians. But they were 
  helpless. The first thing about civilisation is the protection of the helpless. 
  How many Brigadier-General Dyers and how many Amritsars has the Indian state 
  produced in the 40 years since independence? Can India afford them?</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>A notorious order by General 
  Dyer had made Indians crawl on their bellies in a street in the Punjab where 
  a European woman had been assaulted. It reminds one of the way Indians in Sri 
  Lanka do their round ups and keep people humiliatingly waiting for hours to 
  be viewed by informants. Sometimes they are mercilessly beaten for no provocation. 
  On 7 January, 1988, everyone, high and low, in the commercial heart of Jaffna 
  was rounded up and made to sit on the road in the hot sun from 9:30 a.m. to 
  7:00 p.m.. This was after an unknown person had shot dead a soldier. No water 
  was given. Those on the fringes were continually beaten. An officer addressed 
  them several times as &quot;bastards&quot;. When they were released it was time 
  for curfew. When they attempted to go home in the morning after roughing out 
  the night in shophouses, they were again beaten. Do Indians ever not learn from 
  their own history ?</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>What we are saying is 
  that India, which is rightly critical of the evils in Israel and of white racism 
  in Africa, and has itself experienced these evils at first hand, should not 
  merely have formally enforced the laws enshrining centuries of human wisdom; 
  but should also have displayed greater respect for their content. </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>It is left for Indians 
  to decide whether they wish to be faithful to the ideals of their independence 
  struggle. We can only wish them well, not least because we cannot afford turmoil 
  in our big neighbour and to a large extent our spiritual home. This requires 
  a reassessment of moral priorities. </p>

  life and removed all types of semblance of control that the community possessed 
  over civil structures. It has also brought out all the weaknesses of this community 
  and pushed it into total inertness. Indian rule asserts itself through military 
  and political means. The middle classes which have traditionally functioned 
  as servants rather than as initiators are unable to break through, or render 
  their noncommittal services to whomever they have come to accept as their master. 
  </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>The intelligentsia, which at 
  this juncture should be the catalyst energising the benumbed community, is 
  unable to do so. In many instances they have side stepped confrontational issues 
  with the I.P.K.F. (as they have done with the militant groups) and have resigned 
  themselves to passivity. This is the result of their history. As in the past, 
  their conceptual and moral shallowness has made them submit to the authoritarianism 
  of the L.T.T.E. and to gloss over the L.T.T.E.'S brutality. A handful of them 
  have even produced acceptable theories to explain many of the atrocities. Some 
  have attempted to isolate and victimise critics of the movement. However the 
  character of this articulate intellectual segment is largely opportunistic. 
  Their activities, intellectual contributions and their public life, all reflect 
  their stand of preferring to do what is convenient rather than doing what ought 
  to be done. The characteristics of this position are authoritarianism and brutality 
  which characterised their the leadership. Their unprincipled conduct reflected 
  merely a desire to create niches for themselves within which they could survive 
  with the trappings of respectability and nominal power. Yet at the same time 
  they ensured for themselves exoneration from the burden of these reactionary 
  policies by deliberately hanging on at the periphery of these tendencies rather 
  than committing themselves. What is the unacknowledged basis of this segment's 
  position? Why is it that their aspirations do not fit into the classical definitions 
  of organic or traditional intellectuals? This segment is a product of the colonial 
  middle class, whose path to intellectual pretensions was an off shoot of getting 
  educated only for materialist aspirations.</p>

  sections of the community fail the people, what is the alternative? Can the 
  organised political voices provide the way ?</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>The L.T.T.E.'s political line, 
  its obstinacy and shortsightedness left us without any substantive achievement. 
  Even at present, their moves pave the way for total subjugation to Indian domination. 
  For example their recent warning to boycott the civil administration, if heeded, 
  will remove from people the little control they have over civil structures, 
  thereby creating the conditions for Indian authority to encroach fully into 
  the society. Thus the move is counter-productive and would signal doom, as control 
  of the civil life of the community slips by default into Indian hands. </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>On the other, hand can the E.P.R.L.F. 
  or the E.R.O.S. provide the leadership? Although there is some evidence that 
  they would try some reformist programmes, their limitation of being subservient 
  to India would sooner or later lead them to compromise on crucial issues concerning 
  India's domination of the people. This can be seen from the absence of any protest 
  from them against the I.P.K.F.'s atrocities against the ordinary civilians, 
  so far. Therefore it is unlikely that they will be able to offer a viable alternative.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>Would the so called moderates, 
  the T.U.L.F., be an answer? India would certainly try to bring them into the 
  mainstream. But they were the fathers of bigoted racist politics in the community. 
  While they raised emotional anti-Sinhalese hysteria among Tamils, they were 
  involved in tea party politics with the Sinhalese ruling class. At least the 
  militant groups had a certain authenticity among the people, whereas the moderates 
  lost it in time. </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>Indian domination and Tamil 
  narrow nationalism are contradictory. Although these two forces are conflicting, 
  they are interlocked in each other's momentum. The undermining of these forces 
  cannot be done by constructing strategies for the one or the other in isolation. 
  Therefore, because of their interdependence, any alternative should construct 
  a strategy that handles them as a whole. This can be done by bringing anti-racist 
  forces together to undermine neocolonialist penetration and Indian hegemony 
  - and, at the same time exposing the bankruptcy of extreme nationalism. In the 
  Tamil areas, the failure of the L.T.T.E. and wars have brought disillusionment. 
  However, narrow nationalism is still a force in terms of ideology, though its 
  support base is disgruntled, and yet, not more enlightened. It is still anti-Sinhalese, 
  and self-glorious in terms of its relations with India, though the October 
  war had dislodged the cosiness. </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>In the South, the rise of the 
  J.V.P., a parallel to the L.T.T.E., seems to be the only reply to the Indian 
  presence. Although at present, the J.V.P. for tactical reasons has taken 
  care not to come out with an overtly rhetorical stand or armed action against 
  the Tamil population, its anti-Tamil sentiments are well documented in its 
  theoretical essays and exposed in the criticisms by the dissidents from that 
  organisation. But they have never accepted devolution of power to Tamils nor 
  have they any concrete programmes for solving the national question, apart from 
  abstract and meaningless slogans. These dormant tendencies will surface when 
  contradictions intensify with catastrophic consequences - as happened in the 
  case of the L.T.T.E. which was ostensibly not anti-Sinhalese, before 1983, 
  but later exposed its true nature. Without a programme to advocate the devolution 
  of power, decentralization and a just political solution to Tamils, India could 
  not be contained -- let alone be dislodged. Thus any individual organisation 
  has to view the &quot;rational&quot; solution offered in the peace accord in 
  its proper perspective, with a view to fashioning future tasks. It should not 
  confuse justice to Tamils with Indian dominance or abdicate to India the responsibility 
  for the former. </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>The need to accept the political 
  solution provided by the Accord as a first step is a reality. Therefore this 
  position would rationalise the Indian presence. How should a political force 
  articulating the people's interests, view this? We have to show that this devolution 
  has not been the result of the struggles of the internal forces, but rather, 
  that it is imposed by an external force due to the weakness of the internal 
  forces. In such a context the only way an alternative could off-set domination 
  is by strengthening the forces of democracy within. Only then can the devolutionary 
  aspects of the Accord be realised. To achieve this, we have to, as a precondition, 
  build back the weakened democratic structures. Democratisation of the communities 
  should take place to articulate power at grass root level (in the broader interest 
  of the community). </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>This is a crucial step because, 
  as in the Tamil nation, there has never been a healthy, full blown articulation 
  of the people's interests. While the L.T.T.E.'s vision of people's struggles 
  was one of heroes and subjects, other movements like the E.P.R.L.F. and the 
  E.R.O.S. who criticised the L.T.T.E.'s programmes and spoke of the need to mobilise 
  the people, did not themselves have a concrete concept or programme relevant 
  to our realities. Structures for participation by the people were mechanically 
  thought out and remained in the manifestos. Though individuals in these movements 
  strove to work towards a vision, the lack of a coherent organisational programme 
  and the estrangement of theory from practice resulted in empty slogans. That 
  is why, when internal violence and intergroup brutality broke out, there was 
  little visible protest. However, certain instances, such as the T.E.L.O.'s 
  internal violence, and the L.T.T.E.'s offending acts brought people together 
  in some places in angry protest. This was due to cohesion at village and community 
  levels. </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>Thus, revived democratic institutions 
  would voice the people's needs in devolution (in specific issues such as colonisation 
  etc). These would also act as a monitor for the implementation of the limited 
  decentralised power. It would enable such institutions to organise against misdoings 
  and atrocities by the forces they need to deal with. Moreover these structures 
  are essential to stand up against the pressure of individual terrorism that 
  the L.T.T.E. and degenerate elements of other movements indulge in and see to 
  it that individual members of the community are not isolated and victimised. 
  Finally, they would also protect the community from becoming the tools of external 
  agencies.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>The ideology under which such 
  structures are revived or reorganised must be anti-racist. Narrow anti-Sinhalese 
  politics should be uprooted. They should reach out to anti-racist groups and 
  individuals in the South - southern forces that will advocate steadily and consistently 
  a devolution of power to Tamils and stand up against human rights violations. 
  Only this can ensure an unlinking of the cause of Tamil rights from Indian patronage, 
  and thus curtail the Indian role as a protector and arbiter. </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>In reality, Indian dominance 
  in our affairs has come to stay (as a poster erected by the I.P.K.F. at a sentry 
  point says &quot;We have come to stay to protect innocent civilians&quot;). 
  While the military rule is apparent and abrasive, political domination is subtle 
  and invasive. Our task lies in minimising the control of our civil structures 
  by Indian authorities. Already India had announced that it will start constructing 
  coastal railway lines in the East as well as implementing certain investment 
  programmes in the North and the East. In response, we cannot just be rhetorical, 
  but must have a strategy to take the workings into our own hands. At this juncture, 
  Indian penetration into the South seems theoretical. But with rumours of military 
  coups, and strong arm tactics by the Sri Lankan Army, the possibility of such 
  penetration cannot be dismissed as fanciful. The confidence of the chauvinists 
  in the South that anti-Indianism among them is strong and permanent, lulls them 
  into leaving out a crucial factor -- the presence of Hill Country Tamils. We 
  have not dealt with the question of Hill country Tamils in this argument. They 
  need an independent portrayal and analysis . They are becoming central protagonists 
  in the politics of this island. A few militant movements have attempted to 
  graft the hill country Tamils in an ad hoc manner into the Eelam struggle and 
  started work amongst them. But the hill country Tamils have, however, been under 
  the total political domination of the C.W.C (Ceylon Workers Congress). Though 
  they are the largest and most deprived working class population of this island, 
  they received no serious consideration from the working class movement, and 
  were viewed as passive and inarticulate. This failure of the Left was due to 
  its capitulation to Sinhalese Buddhist chauvinism. </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>On the southern front, the anti-racist 
  task of advocating devolution for Tamils will be enormously difficult with the 
  rise of narrow nationalism and Indian entrenchment. But it is important to neutralise 
  both tendencies. Through a programme of this nature we could envisage a marginalisation 
  of Indian patronage for the Sri Lankan Tamils and the hill country Tamils. In 
  this way we would lessen the tempo of narrow nationalism and create difficulties 
  for neocolonialist penetration. </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>However the struggle for solidarity 
  with the Hill Country Tamils seems a lost cause for the working class movements 
  in the South because of their past betrayal. Each nation has to bring forth 
  its grievances which caused these internal divisions in order to seek justice 
  and thus create a unity with the purpose of creating an organic &quot;oneness&quot;.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>These are broad principles and 
  have no prescriptive values. They appear abstract. However, we are individuals 
  sharing these ideas with the hope that they will go some way to initiate discussion. 
  Whether there will be organisations to take on the task is something only the 
  future will tell. </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><b>II.  Towards Reconciliation</b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'></span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>At this point people might 
  ask: &quot;Having said all this, what is the solution?&quot; That is not a question 
  for a few individuals to answer. Nor does it have a ready made one. It is something 
  that requires understanding, courage and a will to act at the popular level. 
  It is of little use trying to expound what pretends to be a solution when things 
  are moving fast and where anything that looks clever now will be wearing a wilted 
  look by the time it appears in print. Vijaya Kumaranatunga was amongst the few 
  Sinhalese who kept their heads while passions resulting from massacres and counter 
  massacres were on the boil. A man with any less moral commitment would have 
  slipped. Though his politics was of the Left, he did not trip over cabalistic 
  slogans. His language was as lucid as his ideas. This is why he was a potent 
  challenge to the false and pretentious. Sixteen days before he was killed, the 
  Sunday Times (31 Janunary, 1988) published an article by him remarkable for 
  its honesty and simplicity. What can work must of necessity be simple ideas. 
  We give some exerpts below: </span></p>
<span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";"Times New Roman";'><br clear=all style='page-break-before:auto;
'>
</span> <div0> 
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;So then what went 
  wrong with the Accord? The government has deliberately delayed the implementation 
  of the Accord. My own feeling is that the ill-conceived and reckless activities 
  of the L.T.T.E. gave the U.N.P. government, which itself is deeply divided on 
  the Accord an excuse for delaying its implementation. India, the third party, 
  became discredited not only in the eyes of many Sinhalese, but also in the eyes 
  of many Tamils and Muslims, because it failed to act decisively and quickly 
  enough in the ensuing situation. So all parties to the Accord have their own 
  share of responsibility for the sorry state of affairs in this country. It is 
  now time to face the question with which we began: Where should we go from here? 
  We could, if we so desire, procrastinate and let things drift towards a protracted 
  guerrilla war between the L.T.T.E. and forces opposed to it. But in that direction 
  does not lie peace and security for the people of Sri Lanka.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>&quot;If we choose to take the 
  road leading to the restoration of democracy and work towards freeing Sri Lanka 
  from a foreign military presence, then the governments of Sri Lanka and India 
  must vigorously and resolutely implement the Accord. It is not by military 'pacification' 
  of the North, East and South that democracy and peace will return to Sri Lanka 
  but by implementing the political solution embodied in the Accord. That solution 
  is the setting up of Provincial Councils without further procrastination.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>&quot;But make no mistake about 
  it; our ethnic problem itself will not be solved merely by the implementation 
  of the Accord. However its implementation is a necessary first step in the resolution 
  of the problem.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>&quot;The final resolution of 
  the ethnic problem is inseparably linked with the struggle to rescue our country 
  from the economic and social ruin of the past decade. That struggle is also 
  the struggle to build a Socialist Democracy in Sri Lanka.&quot;</p>
<span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";"Times New Roman";'><br clear=all style='page-break-before:auto;
'>
</span> <div1> 
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>The implication of this is that 
  the Sri Lankan government should come up with adequate generosity to settle 
  the residual issues such as colonisation without delay. The Tamils for their 
  part must accept the Accord with all its weaknesses as representing the best 
  possible hope, and must call upon the militant groups to trust the people and 
  surrender their weapons.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>Many Tamils would object to 
  this saying that the accord does not meet the basic aspirations of the Tamil 
  people. They would argue that the Provincial Councils had been rendered effete 
  because of over-riding powers vested with the President and Parliament. But 
  the alternative facing us is protracted instability, a climate of terror and 
  an emigration of all those who can contribute towards democracy together with 
  educational and economic stability. If some educated person defends Yogi's rhetorical 
  notion of losing even 75% of our people as war casualties in order to save our 
  land, he is very likely not to regard this country as his permanent home.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>One deeply ingrained habit amongst 
  Tamils is to think that freedoms are best secured by being wrapped up in the 
  law book. Laws are important. Good laws can over the years inspire a stabilising 
  social consensus. But without the restraining influence of a deeply felt social 
  consensus, good laws can be broken with impunity by bad governments. Thus what 
  is more important than laws to Tamils and to everyone else in this country, 
  is a public conscience that is willing to fight continually to ensure justice 
  for everyone. We need a more active form of democracy than the public merely 
  electing governments and then going to sleep and leaving the rest to politicians 
  and lawyers. The laws that ensure fair play may come if trust is established 
  between the several communities that people this island and democracy is re-established. 
  In this sense, instead of pushing matters that give an impression of an antagonistic 
  stance against Sinhalese, it may be more important to secure the rule of the 
  law, freedom of labour and freedom of expression and to free education from 
  state control and curb the extra-judicial powers of the state. One salutary 
  feature of the accord is that it lays down for the first time the principle 
  that Sri Lanka is a multi-ethnic state and recognises Tamil and English as official 
  languages together with Sinhalese.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>Once it is accepted that the 
  cause of justice and democracy requires a perennial struggle for values, and 
  that it is not a matter primarily of legalities, then to accept the accord with 
  its blights in order to put an end to destabilising armed activity is not such 
  a bad thing.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>Another objection maintains: 
  &quot;We the Tamils cannot trust the Sinhalese. If we give away the militants' 
  arms, the Indian and Sri Lankan governments will play us out.&quot; Here the 
  question is what do we do with the arms? The argument at one time amongst the 
  elite was that if enough Sri Lankan policemen and soldiers are shot, the scale 
  of the security operations would tell on the economy and the Sri Lankan government 
  would have to give in. Whilst this argument has been put forward since 1982, 
  the Sri Lankan government shewed few signs of giving up. The victims of this 
  war were rural Tamils and rural Sinhalese. The elite on both sides who egged 
  on the fight were for the most part comparatively safe - if not in Ceylon, then 
  abroad. The other question is this. Suppose the Sri Lankan and Indian governments 
  decide to throw in the towel, would the Tamils have democracy and a control 
  of their own affairs? Experience suggests that such an expectation has no basis.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'>For example, the experience of the Tamils has much 
  to do with overt (physical and legal) oppression.But resisting the more subtle 
  and insidious forms of oppression in modern times, requires a society that 
  is at the level of the common man both interested and alert in matters pertaining 
  to the common good. The increasing importantance of patronage in our decision 
  making processes, together with our recent political experience has made the 
  common man an inert non-entity. One needs to be pessimistic as to how we would, 
  for instance, stand up to pressures from attractively packaged modern technologies 
  and economic inducements, which need to be critically sifted before acceptance. 
  At this level, we need not only a rational relationship with the South but 
  also with the rest of the sub-continent, which is faced with similar problems. 
  The kind of benevolent political influence needed to bring about such a 
  change , is not going to come from the sectarian politics of the present. 
   </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'>The Tamil problem has further acquired many complicating 
  facets, such as the dilemma of Trincomalee Tamils. The end result of genocidal 
  action against Tamils by the Sri Lankan state and massacres of Sinhalese civilians 
  after the Accord, is that Tamils fear the departure of the I.P.K.F.. A similar 
  situation exists in Batticaloa. Thus even if a policy of shooting to chase the 
  Indians out is viable, it will receive no unified support from Tamils.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>The only possible solution to 
  all our problems is to improve communal relations all round - especially between 
  Sinhalese and Tamils. The alternative is Indian tutelage. Even if that option 
  is chosen, we have no way of ensuring India's continued presence. Whether one 
  looks at it from a moral or a pragmatic point of view, winning the confidence 
  of the Sinhalese represents the only way forward. For a start, taking the risks 
  involved must be an act of faith involving no great ingenuity.<a href="#top">[Top]</a></p>
