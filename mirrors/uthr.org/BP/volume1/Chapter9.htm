&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>POST ACCORD: THE INDIAN SUMMER</span></b></p>
<p><b>9.1 The arrival of the I.P.K.F.</b></p>
The response to the Accord from the Tamils of Ceylon was one of relief and jubilation. 
In Batticaloa and Trincomalee where government oppression had been the most far-reaching, 
this jubilation found public expression. In Batticaloa where the S.T.F. once had 
a license to kill, the STF watched sullenly while the people celebrated. Sensing 
an explosive situation, some community leaders telephoned the Indian Embassy and 
asked them to send in the I.P.K.F. early. 
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>Some days before the signing 
  of the Accord, the L.T.T.E. had talks with Mr. Puri of the Indian Embassy in 
  Jaffna. The L.T.T.E. then issued a statement that India had agreed to recognise 
  the L.T.T.E. as the sole legitimate representatives of the Tamil people. On 
  24 July Prabhakaran left Jaffna for Delhi by Indian air force helicopter. In 
  New Delhi he was to meet with Rajiv Gandhi and have talks with Indian officials. 
  Apparently these did not go happily. It was clear that agreement on the Accord 
  had been reached between Delhi and Colombo. Some details were leaked to the 
  Sunday papers in Colombo which published them on 26 July. It was also said that 
  the Accord was going to be signed in the next few days and that New Delhi was 
  confident of securing the L.T.T.E.'s compliance. The government made important 
  concessions to India, especially concerning the non-use of Trincomalee harbour 
  by parties hostile to India. The government had failed in its goals, even false 
  ones, which it set before the Sinhalese people. Its main gains from the Accord 
  were that a sharp drop in the defence budget would provide funds for development 
  projects and for salary increases to public servants, and hopefully put an end 
  to the bloodletting and instability resulting from the war. It had to sell this 
  to the Sinhalese with judicious packaging. The riots which broke out in Colombo 
  with the signing of the Accord indicated that the task would not be easy. The 
  ceremonial aspect was marked by a Sinhalese sailor in the guard of honour swinging 
  the butt of his gun at the Indian Prime Minister, who narrowly escaped serious 
  injury. The government's salesmanship was not without effect. A Colombo based 
  journalist related the story of how a taxi driver let loose at the President 
  with expletives when the Accord was signed. One week later his tone was different. 
  He had said: &quot;Our President is a wise man. He has shrewdly left it to the 
  Indians to handle the Kottiyas (Tigers).&quot; On the other hand, the Sinhalese 
  extremist group, the J.V.P., has been becoming increasingly deadly since the 
  Accord. At the time the Accord was signed, the MP for Tangalle was killed. The 
  J.V.P. has since then followed it up with attacks on leading government personalities, 
  including an attack on the U.N.P. parliamentary group inside the parliamentary 
  complex on 8 August and the murder of the U.N.P. chairman Harsha Abhayawardene 
  on 23 December, 1987. The J.V.P. thrived on soil watered by the government's 
  racist propaganda. Its elimination has now called forth the deployment in Sinhalese 
  territory of the same mental and military apparatus once used against Tamils.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>The L.T.T.E. was now downcast. 
  Little had been heard from New Delhi, from their leader Prabhakaran. From 30 
  July, Indian forces had been flown into Palaly, while Sri Lankan forces were 
  flown South for riot control duties. The L.T.T.E.'s first task was to secure 
  the return of Prabhakaran. To this end crowds were made to sit down and block 
  the roads leading out of Palaly. The crowds appeared to be more curious than 
  angry. For two days the Indian army came out, stood before the crowds, made 
  polite conversation and got back to base. The Accord envisaged a surrender of 
  arms within 72 hours. The L.T.T.E. maintained that it could not take a decision 
  without its leader. The Indians then made an announcement that Prabhakaran would 
  be flown back on 2 August and deposited at Suthumalai from where he had earlier 
  been flown to India. From Palaly to Suthumalai, Prabhakaran was escorted by 
  Indian troops. The L.T.T.E. imposed a curfew for the first time in places straddling 
  the envisaged route. People watching from their houses were strongly discouraged, 
  with little effect, from waving at Indian troops. The L.T.T.E. announced a public 
  meeting at which Mr. Prabhakaran would announce the movement's decision on the 
  surrender of arms. The meeting was held at Suthumalai on 4 August. Tens of thousands 
  attended, including Indian military officials, embassy attaches and local and 
  foreign journalists. Mr. Prabhakaran's speech was commended as having been masterly 
  delivered. He played the role of a chieftain, who had struggled for his people 
  and had been ill-used by India who purported to be a friend. He was now bowing 
  to fate and yet kept his independence and self respect. It was a moving performance, 
  and yet there were discordant notes. The main anxiety for the people was now 
  that the L.T.T.E. should surrender its arms and secure the peace -- peace which 
  had so often turned out to be an elusive phantom. The speech was heading for 
  a tragic climax when Prabhakaran said that their armaments had been used in 
  defence of the people of Tamil Eelam and in defence of their rights. Now, he 
  said, they were parting with these same arms and had decided under pressure 
  to surrender them. A crowd which was in tune with him would have wept aloud. 
  But instead, they applauded. The television broadcast showed a momentary spasm 
  of annoyance passing over Prabhakaran's face. This was a continuation of the 
  communication gap between the L.T.T.E. and the people, which was alluded to 
  in describing the events of 1 May.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>At the same meeting, the L.T.T.E.'s 
  Trincomalee leader, Mr. Pulendran expressed his unhappiness about surrendering 
  their arms in the context of the unresolved problems of Trincomalee. In surrendering 
  the L.T.T.E.'s arms Prabhakaran had commended the Tamils to India's care and 
  had also declined to accept the Chief Ministership in the interim administration.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>With the L.T.T.E.'s decision 
  to surrender arms, it was thought that the peace was here to stay. There was 
  relief all round. It may be mentioned that this period saw the rise of Yogi, 
  the brother of the late Mr. Kugan, the previous second-in-command, to the position 
  of Chief of Propaganda. Subsequently a quantity of arms was ceremonially surrendered 
  by Yogi to the Sri Lankan army at Palaly under I.P.K.F. supervision. Such ceremonies 
  took place throughout the North and East. The arms surrenders by the L.T.T.E., 
  E.R.O.S., E.P.R.L.F., E.N.D.L.F., P.L.O.T.E., and T.E.L.O. were telecast for 
  the benefit of the Sinhalese. The latter three militant groups were exiled in 
  India. The E.N.D.L.F. (Eelam National Democratic Liberation Front, popularly 
  known as Three Star) was made up of a breakaway group of the P.L.O.T.E. under 
  Rajan and a breakaway group of the T.E.L.O.. Under the Accord, it was envisaged 
  that all militant groups would be brought to Ceylon, surrender their arms and 
  take part in democratic politics.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>The rest of the story is about 
  how the failings of all parties to the conflict, the Sri Lankan and Indian governments, 
  the militant groups and the Tamil people, wove themselves into an explosive 
  fabric which ignited in October 1987.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>Each party could pick facts 
  selectively to fuel righteous indignation. Each party could maintain with some 
  justice that it had acted rightly whilst others had ill-used and wounded it. 
  Charity, patience and a sense of give and take were missing. The Accord envisaged 
  a surrender of arms by militants within 72 hours. Even a week after that, arms 
  were still trickling in. President Jayewardene for his part had undertaken to 
  grant amnesty to all militants and to release all prisoners detained. Charges 
  had been framed only against a fraction of those detained. General Sepala Attygalle 
  read out the President's amnesty when Yogi made the first surrender of arms 
  on 6 August. The process of releasing political prisoners also commenced at 
  this time. The Sri Lankan government was convinced that only a small fraction 
  of the arms had been surrendered. In this they had the concurrence of most observers.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>At the joint press conference 
  with the Indian Defence Minister K. C. Pant on 8 October, the President was 
  asked why he went beyond his side of the bargain to grant the amnesty and release 
  prisoners before the L.T.T.E. had hardly begun to move on its part. The President 
  replied that the Indians had persuaded him to honour his part in advance, while 
  the Indians undertook to unearth the arms. Justifying what he had done, the 
  President summed up his argument with impeccable eloquence: &quot;It was an 
  Accord for peace and not for war.&quot; He pointed out that venturing out on 
  the Accord would have been pointless if the war was to go on. With considerable 
  justice, the President could maintain that he had taken commendable risks to 
  make the Accord work.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>On the other hand, the government 
  was in an indecent hurry to resettle displaced Sinhalese persons in the East 
  without a parallel initiative being taken over displaced Tamil persons. Sinhalese 
  were being settled on schemes in the Trincomalee and Amparai districts. The 
  one on the Trincomalee-Habarana Road was in the area where stretches of jungle 
  had been cleared on both sides of the road after the massacre of Sinhalese passengers 
  during the new-year. When questioned by the Trincomalee citizens' committee, 
  minister Gamini Dissanayake replied that this settlement was meant to put a 
  stop to various nefarious activities. The settlement on the Allai-Kantalai Road 
  was more subtle. The Kantalai dam had been breached in April 1986 causing widespread 
  destruction in the adjoining agricultural scheme which was about 30 years old. 
  There had been 70 allotments each to the Tamils and Muslims and 260 to the Sinhalese. 
  The Trincomalee G.A. told the citizens' committee in the presence of the visiting 
  British Minister that after the disaster of April 1986, the Sinhalese settlers 
  had agreed to be relocated elsewhere, while the Tamils and Muslims wished to 
  go back to their old allotments. He explained that since each Sinhalese family 
  which held an allotment had now become 3 by natural increase, the Sinhalese 
  settlers were now being given about 600 allotments on the Allai-Kantalai Road. 
  There was evidently some cheating involved here. For one thing it is not the 
  common rule that every family can claim additional crown land for its natural 
  increase. Nor is it likely that the Tamils and Muslims were told that they could 
  claim extra land for their natural increase if agreeable to relocation. The 
  fact that the government was prepared to use its machinery to cheat in the matter 
  of colonisation before the interim council to administer the North and East 
  came into existence, was bound to arouse Tamil suspicions concerning the Accord. 
  If the government wanted to make the Accord work and to restore Tamil confidence, 
  it should have held off acting in controversial areas until the Tamils could 
  be carried along. The extent of colonisation in question was small and the government 
  had little to gain by flexing its muscles.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>Colonisation touched a tender 
  spot in the Tamil psyche. A Tamil grievance could also be aired against the 
  Accord with a modicum of substance by saying: &quot;The provincial councils 
  envisaged under the Accord are an eyewash. The government is doing the bad old 
  thing in colonisation, with the Indians doing nothing to stop it. The provincial 
  councils will be a ceremonial farce like the ill-fated District Councils of 
  1981.&quot;</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>It has been mentioned that 
  L.T.T.E. leaders such as Mr. Pulendran, who had had a bitter personal experience 
  of the Sinhalese army and in turn caused bitter experiences amongst Sinhalese, 
  had strong feelings on colonisation. To this could be added other complaints, 
  again not entirely lacking in justice. Supporters of the L.T.T.E. could say: 
  &quot;All right, the government and the Indians are complaining about the slow 
  surrender of arms by the L.T.T.E.. But everyone knows that some of the other 
  militant groups were trained and armed by the Indian government just before 
  the Accord. Does that not amount to a plan to destroy the L.T.T.E.? They have 
  hidden arms. Can the L.T.T.E. really afford to surrender all its arms? How will 
  they defend themselves? Moreover the government is hedging on the release of 
  prisoners&quot;</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>Suggestions within government 
  ranks surfaced in the press to the effect that the release of prisoners should 
  be linked to the surrender of arms. Many Tamils found common cause with the 
  L.T.T.E. on the issue of prisoners and on colonisation. It could after all be 
  maintained on legal and moral grounds that the overwhelming bulk of prisoners 
  had no specific charges against them. Thus the government had no business to 
  hold them even for a minute. And then holding them to ransom for arms is an 
  inexcusable absurdity for a government to impose on its Tamil citizens who were 
  in law equal to Sinhalese citizens.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>On the other hand, the other 
  militant groups could say: &quot;We too made a contribution towards Tamil liberation. 
  Hundreds of our comrades gave their lives fighting the Sinhalese army. Not only 
  did the L.T.T.E. murder our comrades in cold blood and torture and humiliate 
  many others, they are also striving to wipe away our contribution from the annals 
  of the Ceylon Tamils. Do not we at least deserve to live?&quot;</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>The Indians could say: &quot;Are 
  not the Tamils moving much more freely and breathing much more easily because 
  of us? Detained Tamils are being steadily released. People should not jump to 
  hasty conclusions about us. We cannot simply go around asking Sinhalese to pack 
  up and go. Our officers have gone about making a careful study of colonisation. 
  Did we not suspend work on a colonisation scheme in the Batticaloa district? 
  The return of all militant groups to the island is a necessary part of the Accord. 
  Our position is that all Tamils have a right to live here and participate in 
  democratic politics. We do not carry a brief for any person or party. The L.T.T.E. 
  must appreciate that.&quot;</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>Everyone had a case as well 
  as complaints. These will be strengthened by the failings of others. Most significant 
  were the failings of India, because she was supposed to be by far the most superior 
  in wisdom, strength and experience; on her mature dexterity hinged the success 
  of the Accord.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>Getting back to the early 
  days of August, it looked for a time that the L.T.T.E. would go in for electoral 
  politics with some quaint touches of its own. To this end the Eelamurasu, which 
  was controlled by the L.T.T.E. started a very traditional attack on the T.U.L.F.. 
  The T.U.L.F. was perceived as the main rival to the L.T.T.E. in the event of 
  elections. The Eelamurasu started a column called Somersaults aimed at discomfiting 
  the T.U.L.F.. For example, it published an old photograph of the veteran T.U.L.F. 
  politician, Mr. V. Navaratnam driving President Jayewardene, then leader of 
  the Opposition, in his automobile. It promoted elements of the L.T.T.E.'s religious 
  creed - that there were precisely 631 martyrs for the cause of Tamil Eelam. 
  631 was the number of its dead claimed by the L.T.T.E.. Around this time Mr. 
  Shankar, an E.R.O.S. leader, stated in an interview with the Colombo based Sunday 
  Island that his group had lost 150 men and said in an aside that none of them 
  had taken cyanide. The L.T.T.E. men carried cyanide capsules around their necks 
  and many of those who died did so taking cyanide after being cornered. The Eelamurasu 
  responded with a polemical piece against Shankar. All this had the flavour of 
  election-time politics which people were comfortable with. The L.T.T.E.'s deputy 
  leader, Mr. Sri Mahattaya, uncharacteristically started giving interviews to 
  foreign and Colombo papers. He told the Weekend that Sinhalese were welcome 
  to Jaffna and would not be harmed. Sinhalese flocked to see the lost land of 
  Jaffna. This too augured well.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>However, there were elements 
  of instability evident at this time. One was the L.T.T.E.'s insistence that 
  its 631 dead were the only ones who died in the cause of the liberation of Tamils. 
  The dead from other militant groups and from amongst civilians were demoted 
  to useless chaff. Such intolerance was bound to lead towards angry violence. 
  The other was that many of the members of the P.L.O.T.E., E.N.D.L.F. and T.E.L.O. 
  now lodged in Mannar, Vavuniya and Kilinochchi were strongly motivated by a 
  desire to take revenge on the L.T.T.E.. Prominent amongst these were Sankili 
  (Kandasamy), a leading member of the P.L.O.T.E., and Rajan.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>Many felt uncomfortable that 
  India had chosen such a volatile arrangement. India could argue that the peace 
  accord had in it a package deal for all the militants. If participation in murder 
  was to be a criterion, all militant groups, including the L.T.T.E., should be 
  sent to the Andaman Islands. This would not be feasible and perhaps not what 
  people wanted.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>Another aspect of the L.T.T.E.'s 
  political thrust came to light in early August. A little known affair which 
  concerned the students of the University of Jaffna was the kidnapping by the 
  L.T.T.E. of the student Rajakaran. The student had been active in matters of 
  common interest and had taken part as a member of the action committee during 
  the affair in November 1986 of the missing student Vijitharan. It later came 
  to light that the actual reason for kidnapping the student was to do with the 
  L.T.T.E.'s suspicion that Rajakaran had connections with the N.L.F.T., a small 
  Marxist group. Its leader Mr. Viswanandadevan, an Engineer and pungent critic 
  of the L.T.T.E.'s, had been missing for two years. It was suspected that he 
  had been killed during a crossing from India. The L.T.T.E. had detained and 
  harassed other members of the N.L.F.T., but had been unable to get at the group's 
  cash and weaponry. It was hoped by the L.T.T.E. that Rajakaran may be able to 
  help. At the time of Rajakaran's kidnapping, Viswanandadevan's 70 year old father 
  in Nelliady had also been arrested and beaten. His compound had also been dug 
  up. Rajakaran's detention was denied by the L.T.T.E.. For this reason, the worst 
  was suspected. But the versatile Rajakaran escaped L.T.T.E. custody in early 
  July. In a letter dated 17 July 1987, Rajakaran appealed to the Jaffna University 
  Teachers' Association (J.U.T.A.) to speak to the L.T.T.E. and seek a guarantee 
  that he would not be harmed. It was subsequently left to the students themselves 
  to raise the matter with the L.T.T.E.. Here again the students had acted with 
  commendable boldness where others had been held back by unwarranted fear. The 
  discussion was cordial. Mr. Sri Mahattaya himself admitted that the students 
  had been tackled the wrong way and assured them that no harm will befall Rajakaran. 
  The students put it diplomatically that such an assurance should be made publicly. 
  Mahattaya agreed. On a subsequent day he made an appearance at the Kailasapathy 
  auditorium and gave such an assurance. He said during his statement that Rajakaran 
  was investigated for links with a criminal organisation. It is interesting that 
  other militant groups came to be branded as criminal (anarchic) only because 
  the L.T.T.E. was the most successful in the employment of similar methods. </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>The surprising development 
  was that Rajakaran was present and took the stage on request. The L.T.T.E. walked 
  out. Rajakaran described his experiences under detention, including physical 
  hurt. A revealing piece of information he gave was that Mr. Kailasapillai, a 
  T.U.L.F. stalwart from Illuppaikkadavai in the Mannar district, had been a co-detainee 
  with him at a camp in Tellipallai. A few days before the Eelamurasu had featured 
  Mr. Kailasapillai with his photograph in its lead story. In an interview he 
  had reportedly said that the T.U.L.F. was no longer needed and praised the armed 
  youth. An attorney in the K.K.S. electorate who was close to the T.U.L.F. leader, 
  A. Amirthalingam, made a similar recantation. It cannot be said that election 
  politics in Ceylon was strange to such methods. Only, the degree was new. Fear 
  had replaced bribery.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span></span> The I.P.K.F. had promised 
  that all militant groups were entitled to its protection. In Mannar the L.T.T.E. 
  had sought an I.P.K.F. escort. The E.N.D.L.F. under its leader, Rajan, made 
  its appearance in Jaffna under I.P.K.F. escort. It addressed a meeting in the 
  University. It made an attempt to set up an office on Beach Road. An L.T.T.E. 
  instigated crowd sat on the road in front of the house, shouted slogans and 
  threw stones. An E.N.D.L.F. man who went out to peep was caught and was being 
  badly mauled. One of his comrades after appealing to I.P.K.F. men who were present, 
  and not finding an immediate response, grabbed a gun from one of them and fired 
  it into the air. The crowd dispersed. The not so independent press in Jaffna 
  reported the matter as a case of the people not wanting the E.N.D.L.F.. The 
  first reported internecine killings were those of 3 L.T.T.E. men in the Mannar 
  district. In another incident an armed party of the L.T.T.E. that was sent to 
  avenge these killings was reportedly surrounded and shot. During this latter 
  half of August, there was little to worry in Jaffna itself, but killings and 
  counter killings amongst militants started occurring in Vavuniya, Kilinochchi, 
  Mannar and Trincomalee. The mood of optimism in Jaffna was however heightened 
  by the resumption of the train service to Colombo on 31 August. Jaffna's Tamil 
  language Uthayan daily carried a report that the Indians were to build the much 
  longed for rail link from Jaffna to Batticaloa. Although Jaffna, Trincomalee 
  and Batticaloa were linked by Tamil territory comprising the Eastern seaboard, 
  travel between them was cumbersome and of late, hazardous. This too was something 
  to smile about. The train with a repair crew appeared in Jaffna on the evening 
  of 30 August after an absence of 18 months, and stopped near the Kachcheri to 
  replace some missing sleepers. A happy crowd gathered as if to welcome visiting 
  Royalty. The job was quickly done. The I.P.W. (Inspector of Permanent Ways) 
  looked at his watch and said in the homely, but not quite Queen's English that 
  one has long associated with that tribe: &quot;It is getting bloody late. Let's 
  move on.&quot; He then signalled to the gangs of navvies to get on board. A 
  whole host of children clambered up as the train pulled off, to enjoy a free 
  ride up to the station six hundred yards away.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>Then things began to move 
  in Jaffna. On 1 September, an L.T.T.E. sentry at Kulapitty junction in Kokkuvil 
  was abducted by persons travelling in a van, assaulted and later released. On 
  the night of 7 September, four Assembly of God (A.O.G.) churchmen who were travelling 
  in a van were gunned down at Uduvil junction. Two of the dead were Sinhalese 
  clergy from the South. The motive for the killing was unclear and was put down 
  to misadventure. The incident happened around 10:00 p.m. The van was to go inside 
  Church Lane to pick up another A.O.G. clergyman. L.T.T.E. sources claimed that 
  they were the intended victims. So did the E.N.D.L.F.. All that is known is 
  that prior to the shooting, masked gunmen with walkie-talkies detained two A..O.G. 
  members in that area. They heard orders being issued to fire at a white van 
  that was coming. The two A.O.G. members tried telling the gunmen without success 
  that their own pastors were expected in a van.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>The following day an L.T.T.E. 
  loudspeaker car went around announcing in the Chunnakam area: &quot;Not only 
  are these criminal groups now killing our members. They have now taken to murdering 
  Christian clergy.&quot; On 3 September,the Assistant Government Agent of Mutur 
  Mr. Habib Mohammed was shot dead in the early hours of the morning as he was 
  returning from the mosque. Mutur lies South across Kottiar Bay from Trincomalee 
  harbour. The same day angry Muslim demonstrators smashed up the L.T.T.E. office 
  in Mutur town. The L.T.T.E. denied responsibility for the killing. The effect 
  of the killing was to reawaken suspicions between the Muslims and Tamils of 
  the East.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>Organising hartals (or work 
  stoppages) to stir up political feeling was commonplace in the North and East. 
  First the T.U.L.F. did it. Then each militant group had its independent hartals. 
  The L.T.T.E. claimed to be against hartals but nevertheless had them. The difference 
  was that &quot;the people&quot; organised them, and the L.T.T.E. generally left 
  people who went to work alone until lately. Earlier they were organised to protest 
  against the government. More recently their purpose was to mark the deaths in 
  battle of leading militants. From the time of the T.U.L.F., the success of hartals 
  required implicit force. For this reason it was also an act of self deception 
  by which the organisers would claim high popularity ratings. If all shops and 
  offices were closed, and transport stopped even to deter the sick from being 
  taken for treatment, the organisers would claim a hundred percent success. The 
  way they said it would betray the feeling that they, the sponsors, were also 
  hundred percent popular.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>On 9 September, the Muslims 
  of Kalmunai organised a hartal to protest the murder of Mr. Habib Mohammed. 
  This went off peacefully. The L.T.T.E. announced its own hartal for the identical 
  cause to be observed on the following day.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>In the morning hoodlums looted 
  and burnt Muslim shops in Kalmunai as armed men stood by. Muslim residents associated 
  the gunmen with the L.T.T.E.. Telephone messages were sent by the Muslim leaders 
  in Kalmunai to the I.P.K.F. at Akkaraipattu, asking them to to come to their 
  aid. According to a Muslim academic from Kalmunai, the I.P.K.F. came late around 
  2 o'clock in the afternoon after pressure was applied by Muslims at Akkaraipattu. 
  They came with one Velmurugan master who was again said by Muslim to be close 
  to the L.T.T.E.. The I.P.K.F. then proceeded to remove roadblocks put there 
  by Muslims to block traffic as a sign of protest. One Tamil school-teacher who 
  was there observed that the I.P.K.F. had acted ill-advisedly in removing those 
  road blocks. For if a militant group had organised a stoppage, a hint from them 
  would stop traffic on the roads. Everyone was afraid of guns. The I.P.K.F. had 
  never interfered with these. But the Muslims are not known for possessing gun-power. 
  Road blocks are for them the only means of enforcing a hartal and saving face. 
  Above the I.P.K.F.'s perceived tardiness in responding to the call by Muslims 
  for protection, the removal of road blocks was also seen as discriminatory. 
  As an overwhelmingly Hindu body, to play the role of peacekeepers, the I.P.K.F. 
  should have been prepared to show greater sensibility to Muslims. Qadri Ismail, 
  writing in the Colombo based Sunday Times, gave another angle to the events 
  in Kalmunai. He pointed out that the role of Tamil gunmen need not be blamed 
  on the high level policy of any particular militant group. The Kalmunai Mosque 
  stood on premises on which once stood a colony of low caste Tamils who had been 
  driven out by Muslims 20 years ago. There was an element of settling old scores 
  by descendants of the disinherited. The end result was to heighten tension and 
  distrust towards the Accord within the Muslim community.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>On the night of 13 September, 
  the L.T.T.E. launched a surprise strike against members of other militant groups 
  in the Batticaloa district. Most of the victims were unarmed and had thought 
  themselves to be safe. According to press reports, about 70 of them were killed. 
  Several others sought shelter even with the once dreaded S.T.F.. The attack 
  was denied publicly by the L.T.T.E.. The L.T.T.E. had launched on a new reckless 
  course, pregnant with catastrophic consequences for everyone in the North and 
  East. The L.T.T.E. had committed an outrage which was an open secret buzzing 
  about the airwaves of the international news media. Those who defend the L.T.T.E. 
  would blame India, maintaining that India had plans to use the other groups 
  to destroy the L.T.T.E. while for the L.T.T.E. it was a case of do now or die 
  later. This would hardly justify a massacre of unarmed militants who would not 
  have known what hit them. Our experience with members of other militant groups 
  suggests that they were certainly angry with the L.T.T.E.. They wished to re-assert 
  their dignity and wanted the community to give them a place of respect. But 
  to suggest that they were incognate tools of India's would be an unfair overstatement. 
  A large number of them would have chosen reconciliation with the L.T.T.E. on 
  honourable terms if that course had been open. It would be more true to say 
  that the other groups were driven into India's hands by the position taken by 
  the L.T.T.E. and because of increasing rejection by the community. The two processes 
  were interdependent.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>Politically, the L.T.T.E. 
  had been dissatisfied with the way things were developing. It had been offered 
  3 seats in an interim administrative council of 8. Two places went to the T.U.L.F., 
  1 to another militant group and 2 were to be government employees. The interim 
  body was to administer the North and East until provincial council elections 
  could be held. That was expected to take anything from 6 months to a year. Whether 
  the interim council was going to administer or advise, and whether elections 
  would be held on a first past the post or on a proportional representation basis 
  were questions on which no clear answer had emerged. The L.T.T.E. had apparently 
  pitched its ambitions much higher than what the Indian and Sri Lankan governments 
  would allow or what the majority of Tamils considered prudent. The L.T.T.E. 
  was angling for sole control of the North and East, as evidenced in its past 
  conduct. They had displayed a capacity for astounding turns that had made headlines 
  and for the most incorrigible conduct which confounded whoever had dealings 
  with them. And their strength was a readiness to gamble with their own lives, 
  and incidentally with those of many others, in pursuit of their aims. The last 
  was symbolised by cyanide capsules. They had been gods. Good and Evil, Truth 
  and Falsehood, Friends and Enemies and even solemn pacts had little meaning 
  for them. Like the gods of ancient Hellas, they dwelt in an existentialist world; 
  in their own Mount Olympus, presided over by their own Zeus. What was on offer 
  for them now was the tame respectability of provincial dignitaries. They were 
  tempted as events would show, and yet uncomfortable and undecided. Just as they 
  had agreed to surrender their arms, they seemed amenable to agreeing to something 
  as a means of buying time. </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>Life had been relatively unexciting 
  after the Accord. Several of the L.T.T.E. leaders such as Kumarappa and Pulendran 
  had got married. They enjoyed the respectability of social life with senior 
  Indian army officers who joined in the nuptial festivities. There were beach 
  outings. Yet their self-image of virility was being sapped. They were being 
  treated increasingly like a Tiger whose claws had been blunted. Dignitaries 
  from the South, journalists, both local and foreign, were flocking in to see 
  them, as they would go to a zoo to see a caged animal. Should they be tamed, 
  they had nothing to fall back on. The people did not really love them. They 
  simply admired and obeyed them. But who would honour and obey a senile animal 
  that had lost its teeth and claws? This was worrying. What would an ancient 
  god do in a world that had been his domain, and which was now so changed as 
  to exclude him? Like the legendary Wotan in Niebelung's Ring, it was time for 
  a suicidal leap; to create some of the most obscene scenes in an effort to do 
  or die. They were once more going to revive their capacity to shock. They were 
  prepared to throw away all they had worked for - friendships cultivated assiduously 
  over months as well as numerous of lives. But, did the parties concerned have 
  other choices?</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>The fact that the Indians 
  were talking almost exclusively to the L.T.T.E. was an indication that they 
  had accepted the L.T.T.E. as a power that counted, and that to attempt to exclude 
  them would be taking too much trouble on themselves. This indication was strengthened 
  by later events. Behind all the Indian rhetoric during the October war, feelers 
  to the L.T.T.E. were being constantly made. Doubts continued to remain in the 
  public mind as to whether India was really serious about crushing the L.T.T.E..</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>Even if the L.T.T.E. had really 
  believed that its destruction was being sought, it could have moved to strengthen 
  its ties with the people. It could have admitted and apologised for past errors. 
  Terms for reconciliation with dignity could have been offered to other militant 
  groups. It could have moved to tolerate dissent and democratise its organisation. 
  Such moves would have made it difficult for any outside force to weaken it. 
  The L.T.T.E. enjoyed enough prestige to carry these through. Students at the 
  University of Jaffna and several intellectuals had been entreating the L.T.T.E. 
  for such gestures for over a year, only to be given the short shrift. Except 
  for the diehards, most militants from other groups would have been extremely 
  happy with such an offer. Under these conditions, few Tamils would have actively 
  worked against the L.T.T.E., other than those whose drive for vengeance was 
  very strong. But the L.T.T.E. chose rather a sensational use of violence in 
  a bid to demonstrate their immense potential to sour things.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>The other militant groups 
  felt that they deserved a place of honour and that the L.T.T.E. was systematically 
  conspiring to disinherit them. In this most Tamils would have sympathised with 
  them. Their presence in certain areas was guaranteed by the Indian army. They 
  could have used this to their advantage. They could have made and stuck to a 
  public pledge that even if the L.T.T.E. did not wish to work with them, they 
  were against taking revenge on either the L.T.T.E. or its supporters. They could 
  have got actively involved in projects to help the local people. Instead of 
  harassing travellers, they could have printed and distributed leaflets through 
  them, appealing to the Tamil people to recognise their contribution and criticising 
  the L.T.T.E.'s stand. But many of them chose differently. In their frustration 
  they developed an antipathy towards the common Tamil people, especially those 
  from Jaffna, who were accused of being pro-L.T.T.E.. Bus passengers were regularly 
  harassed and frequently robbed. Extortion and robbery once again reappeared 
  in parts they inhabited. Vehicles were hijacked. As internecine killings increased, 
  they were driven to depend more and more on the Indian and Sri Lankan forces. 
  All this led to the strengthening of the stereotype image that the L.T.T.E. 
  was trying to pin on them.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>The arrival of the Indian 
  Peace Keeping Force was widely welcomed by the Tamils of Ceylon. They had come 
  to preside over peace and not over war. They started by doing the right things. 
  Their conduct was disciplined even in a state of provocation. They defused landmines 
  left behind by the former antagonists. When Major Dilip Singh, Lieutenant Vickram 
  and Mohinder Rao from the Eighth Battalion (Engineers) died in a mine clearing 
  accident, there was universal grief in Jaffna. These men had given their lives 
  for the people of Jaffna. The mother of the last on being given the heart breaking 
  news of her son's death had reportedly remarked: &quot;I am happy that he died 
  this way.&quot; How did it happen that by mid-September, the image of the I.P.K.F. 
  was looking tattered; and by the second week of October it had blundered itself 
  into killing Tamil civilians by the hundreds? Aspects of this question have 
  been dealt with in different parts of the volume.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>By the middle of September, 
  developments stretching back over a month brought about a situation that was 
  anything but peaceful. Yet the Indian Peace Keeping Force had remained seemingly 
  inert. At first it looked as if the I.P.K.F. was offering protection to all 
  militant groups when they were escorted on request. Then internecine killings 
  started, people started to disappear and four clergymen were killed in Jaffna. 
  The position of the I.P.K.F. seemed to be that its brief was to retrieve arms 
  from militant groups and not to maintain law and order. The L.T.T.E. claimed 
  that it had trusted the I.P.K.F. to protect Tamils from the Sri Lankan army. 
  But instead, while the Sri Lankan army was still here, the I.P.K.F. was establishing 
  camps in places where the Sri Lankan army was nowhere about. Sinister motives 
  were hinted at. The Indian High Commissioner Mr. J. N. Dixit in an interview 
  with D. B. S. Jeyaraj published in the Sunday Island of 30 August, 1987, stated 
  that the I.P.K.F. was establishing the new camps to contain internecine fighting 
  between militant groups. He also stated that 65% of the arms including 85% of 
  the heavy weapons had been surrendered. Elsewhere he had said that 80% of the 
  arms had been surrendered. </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>It was the surrender of arms 
  that was of the greatest concern to the Sinhalese. The putsch by the L.T.T.E. 
  on the night of 13 September in Batticaloa and the continuing killings elsewhere 
  seemed to make these claims far less convincing. Not only did the L.T.T.E. seem 
  to possess plenty of arms, they seemed also to be able to move about freely 
  over a wide area notwithstanding the I.P.K.F., and use the arms against other 
  militants. As the L.T.T.E. became increasingly vocal and demonstrative in Jaffna, 
  especially after Thileepan's fast, passengers to and from Jaffna were increasingly 
  harassed by other militant groups between Kilinochchi and Jaffna while Indian 
  and Sri Lankan forces looked on.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>On all counts the I.P.K.F. 
  was acquiring a sorry image. For the Sinhalese it was not retrieving arms. And 
  for the Tamils it was not maintaining peace. The L.T.T.E. propaganda machine 
  went to town on what was appearing to be a contradictory role of the I.P.K.F., 
  spicing it up with colonisation, the slow release of prisoners and the increase 
  of crime.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>Even more surprising was the 
  complacency of the I.P.K.F. in not going to the people to defend its role. It 
  had much to take credit for. The threat to civilian life through military action 
  had virtually ended. Freedom of movement for all Tamils, Muslims and Sinhalese 
  had been restored. In the Trincomalee district, Tamils could get back to lands 
  they were driven out of. There was a likelihood that town property that was 
  forcibly taken over by Sinhalese thugs with government blessing would be restored 
  to their owners. People were able to regain their homes in other Tamil areas 
  which had now been de-mined and made safe from shelling. Train services had 
  been restored. There was every prospect that rehabilitation work would commence 
  and that aid money would help those who had been ruined.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>Furthermore, Tamil prisoners 
  were in fact being released. The delay could have been explained as coming from 
  technicalities. The problem of colonisation was being studied and particular 
  allegations were being investigated by I.P.K.F. officers. At least in one instance 
  in Batticaloa district, the I.P.K.F. had halted work on a scheme. The L.T.T.E.'s 
  actions could have been rationally attacked. The adequacy of powers given to 
  Tamil areas under the Accord could have been patiently explained and the L.T.T.E. 
  could have been asked to trust the people to decide when elections are held. 
  Further, the Indian authorities could have addressed regular press conferences 
  and seminars in the Tamil areas and could have had consultations with independent 
  sections of Tamil opinion. The latter would have provided the means of correcting 
  errors, avoiding blunders and understanding their unfamiliar environment.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>If the Indians had attempted 
  to use the press, that would have been understood. But when the I.P.K.F. on 
  10 October, 1987, detained newspapermen from two newspapers and reportedly damaged 
  the machinery, that was seen by the public as a rowdy and unjustifiable act. 
  Newspapers in Jaffna had got used to bending in the face of authority while 
  fancying themselves not to break. It was said that some newspapers which respected 
  independence, avoided trouble by reserving the front and back pages for obligatory 
  material, while publishing independent material in the inner pages. But the 
  people apparently came so low down the list of Indian concerns, that they were 
  freely given over to the L.T.T.E. to play with their emotions. Anyone who witnessed 
  the highly volatile scenes which followed, could not but help feeling that we 
  had blundered on to the edge of a volcano.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>The I.P.K.F. stuck to dealing 
  with the L.T.T.E. exclusively with increasing exasperation. The L.T.T.E. had 
  no particular obligation to stick to one position. It was free to play with 
  the Indian authorities on one hand and the people on the other as long as no 
  tangible link (except the L.T.T.E. itself) existed between the Indian authorities 
  and the Tamil people. When dealings with the L.T.T.E. yielded little more than 
  exasperation, the framework in which the Indians operated led them into a war 
  for which they were ill prepared.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>All actors were imprisoned 
  in mental frames into which they had been led by past choices. Sorely lacking 
  were individuals with the strength of character to leap out of the incubus of 
  history to turn the tide. All were being sucked into a chasm where they would 
  lose control of events.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>The L.T.T.E. was now set on 
  a desperate course. It was prepared to offend the minimal norms of human communication. 
  In an interview given by Mahattaya and the L.T.T.E. spokesman Anton Balasingam 
  to Jehan Haniff of the Sunday Island, the L.T.T.E. was questioned about the 
  killings of 70 militants in the Batticaloa district and about the surrender 
  of arms. In reply Balasingam said that the L.T.T.E. had surrendered all its 
  arms and that the killings in Batticaloa had resulted from fighting between 
  dissident militant groups. Interestingly, Balasingam made reference to Mahattaya 
  before answering these questions. Balasingam's position within the organisation 
  was something of an enigma. He was known to refer to the L.T.T.E. as a mafia-type 
  organisation. On one occasion he was quoted widely to this effect in the press 
  including that in Jaffna. No attempt was made by the L.T.T.E. to contradict 
  this. It is known from sources close to the organisation that despite a stormy 
  relationship, he and Prabhakaran needed each other.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><b>9.2 The Fast</b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";letter-spacing:-.1pt'>On 
  15 September, Mr. Thileepan, the Jaffna chief of the L.T.T.E.'s political wing 
  started his death fast near Nallur Kandasamy temple. A platform was set up and 
  Thileepan and his helpers were on it. Five demands were put forward, two of 
  which dealt with colonisation and the release of prisoners. The fast was at 
  first not taken seriously. The Indians calculated that it would end as fasts 
  normally do, and hoped to ride it out by ignoring it. It took some time before 
  it sank in that Thileepan was not taking even water. All India Radio broadcast 
  a statement by the government spokesman which said that as a leader with a cause, 
  Mahatma Gandhi undertook fasts to death himself; he did not send in one of his 
  assistants to undergo the ordeal and sit back. But the emotional climate was 
  being stirred up so much that it had little impact. When things were looking 
  like they were getting out of hand, the Indians started talks with the L.T.T.E.. 
  Tamil Nadu politicians Pandruti Ramachandran and Nedumaran arrived on the scene. 
  Indian officers too started visiting Thileepan. Shortly before Thileepan began 
  his fast he made a remarkable speech in front of Jaffna fort, giving a singular 
  twist to Tamil nationalist history. &quot;Accords,&quot; he said, &quot;have 
  been brought about by our enemies to dampen national fervour whenever this shows 
  signs of boiling over. Today, the Indo-Lanka accord is meant to suppress the 
  thirst of the people for liberation.&quot; He then pointed his finger histrionically 
  at the Jaffna Fort and continued: &quot;The first inhabitants of this were the 
  Dutch and they enslaved us anew. Then came likewise the Sinhalese and now the 
  Indians with new accords and new promises. Our aim is to chase away the Indians 
  and fly our own flag of freedom in this Fort.&quot; This rousing speech may 
  have gone down in history if not for the utter disillusionment which followed 
  in October.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>At first Thileepan's fast 
  looked like a gimmick meant to divert attention from the killings in the East. 
  The L.T.T.E. quickly used its organisational capacity to build up the emotional 
  momentum. Loudspeaker vehicles went about broadcasting maudlin sentiments. Public 
  transport vehicles were used to ferry in crowds. Long distance marchers converged 
  on Kandasamy Kovil. Heart-rending cries over loudspeakers and sobbing noises 
  had their effect. The cry &quot;Thileepan anna (elder brother),&quot; rising 
  to a high pitch became familiar around Jaffna. The feeling was drummed up that 
  such a fine man as Thileepan was going to die only because the Indians had cheated 
  the Tamils and were only here to help the Jayewardene government.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>The hartals or stoppages called 
  for in Jaffna during Thileepan's fast disrupted public transport and made train 
  services irregular. The other militant groups interpreted the press coverage 
  and the rallies in Jaffna as a pro-L.T.T.E. gesture, unmindful of what the L.T.T.E. 
  had done to them. Their attitude assumed an abusive anti-Jaffna stance. They 
  decided that if people in Jaffna were going to travel just when it suited the 
  L.T.T.E., then they too were going to allow people to travel only when it suited 
  them. Train services stopped at Kilinochchi and passengers were stranded without 
  a bus service to complete the rest of the journey. Hiring cars charged as much 
  as Rs.500/- per passenger to complete the remaining 40 miles to Jaffna. To many 
  travellers the harassment by the E.N.D.L.F. seemed Indian instigated, as a way 
  of hitting back for the anti-Indian hysteria being created by the L.T.T.E. in 
  Jaffna.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>Clearly the difficulties of 
  travellers owed much to the capriciousness of the L.T.T.E.. The Indians could 
  have exposed this by trying to be helpful to those in difficulty. But they instead 
  appeared in vindictive light by identifying the Jaffna people with the L.T.T.E.. 
  This further incensed feelings in Jaffna and played into the hands of the L.T.T.E..</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>Emotional crowds at road junctions 
  were once more in vogue. These were the same crowds that welcomed with tears 
  the Indian Red Cross team less than 3 months before. Jaffna had been rendered 
  even more unprincipled and volatile by liberation politics. But to call the 
  crowds anti-Indian would have been a misrepresentation. India was still the 
  holy mother. The people were an angry child hitting and screaming at the mother 
  to have its way. The L.T.T.E. instigated crowds to humiliate the Indian army. 
  At Manthikai crowds of women threw stones at the Indian army. Personal insults 
  were flung at Indian soldiers -- like stroking the beard of a Sikh soldiers 
  and calling him a half-beedi man (beedi is a cheaper form of cigarette) The 
  Indian soldiers were highly restrained. The only shooting took place in Manner.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>In Mannar a crowd marched 
  towards an I.P.K.F. camp along the road from Mannar to Talai Mannar, urged on 
  by an L.T.T.E. loudspeaker from a car. Once the crowd was highly strung with 
  shouting slogans, the loudspeaker car instigated the crowd to march on the camp. 
  An Indian officer came out and begged the crowd with folded hands not to advance 
  beyond a certain point. The loudspeaker kept up its harangue and the men behind 
  fired and killed one man in the vanguard of the crowd. The crowd quickly dispersed.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>At this time a group of Sinhalese 
  visited Jaffna on a peace mission. The party included Mr. Shelton Ranaraja, 
  Deputy Minister for Justice, the Rev. Fr. Yohan Devananda and several doctors 
  including the G.M.O.A. Secretary Dr. Ratnapriya. Shelton Ranarajah, though holding 
  a junior ministerial position in the ruling United National Party, held publicly 
  expressed independent and liberal views on the ethnic question. For him it was 
  a pilgrimage of reconciliation with a view to seeing and understanding. He came 
  despite the risk to himself as an unprotected member of the government, coming 
  during a highly strung period. The doctors had brought medical supplies to hold 
  clinics. Many Sinhalese with a left wing bent had come to admire the L.T.T.E. 
  as an effective revolutionary force. These Sinhalese had campaigned against 
  the government without major success. The government had found means of neutralising 
  their influence while allowing them a respectable existence. For them the remarkable 
  success of the L.T.T.E. was a revelation. That the success followed in the wake 
  of risks taken by no other leaders in this country, was to be admired. The deceit, 
  murder and inhumanity involved in that success was taken to be of no account. 
  A Sinhalese clergyman, who was an admirer of the L.T.T.E.'s, once told a Tamil 
  clergyman: &quot;They are doing the fighting. You have no moral right to criticise 
  them.&quot; Even as a clergyman, he little realised that in the political climate 
  of the times, much courage was needed to preserve our sense of values as a community. 
  This kind of moral fight too involved risks as the hundreds of internal killings 
  within and without the militant groups had testified.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>Some of the most provocative 
  incidents in Jaffna took place on Friday, 18 September. At Manthikai, the Pt. 
  Pedro police station which was manned by the Ceylon Police was attacked by crowds 
  egged on by agent provocateurs. The police station was burnt and the policemen 
  were humiliated. The I.P.K.F. nearby did nothing to stop it. The policemen were 
  made to march towards the army camp in Pt. Pedro carrying their belongings on 
  their heads. A crowd shouting abuse followed behind. The vast majority of people 
  were silent spectators. Many who saw the sorry looking policemen were alarmed 
  and saddened. The policemen had done nothing since assuming duties in Pt. Pedro 
  to deserve such treatment. Many common people observed that we as a community 
  were going to pay for this.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>The peace mission from the 
  South had come as guests of the L.T.T.E. leader. A hartal was declared on 18 
  September. Members of the peace mission obtained a special pass from Sri Mahattaya 
  to drive their vehicle into Vadamaratchi. They witnessed some of the worst scenes 
  on that day. They saw a police vehicle burning at Pt. Pedro. At Valvettithurai 
  they saw a crowd in front of the police station shouting abuse. The peace mission 
  was manoeuvred in front of the crowd to face angry policemen who were armed. 
  The scene was very provoking to the police. A smashed chair belonging to the 
  police station lay before them. On learning that those now standing in front 
  of the crowd were Sinhalese, the policemen shouted angrily at them: &quot;You 
  are the ones who brought them here.&quot; Members of the peace mission felt 
  that the police may open fire any time and that they would then be the first 
  victims. As they went away, they met an L.T.T.E. man loading a magazine into 
  his automatic. He told them derisively: &quot;You got scared, didn't you?&quot; 
  They saw a similar scene at the Sri Lankan army camp in Valvettithurai. An abusive 
  crowd stood in front of the camp. A drunken, gesticulating soldier stood before 
  the crowd returning the abuse. An officer came out and dragged the drunken soldier 
  away. It was clear that the L.T.T.E. was angling for a scene where one of the 
  armed forces would open fire leaving several dead civilians on the road. What 
  a nice story that would have made around the world: &quot;In the middle of a 
  non-violent struggle with a Gandhian style fast going on, Indian and/or Sri 
  Lankan forces open fire and kill innocent civilians!&quot; It was also clear 
  that the Indian and Sri Lankan forces were just barely controlling themselves.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>The peace mission was to return 
  to Colombo the following day. Since a hartal was on, they obtained permission 
  to travel in their two vehicles. All the way from Jaffna, they were followed 
  by a van past several sentry points manned by the L.T.T.E.. There could be little 
  mistake about the identity of the persons in the van that followed. Past Pallai, 
  this van overtook them. At Yakkachchi (4 miles before Elephant Pass) this van 
  was parked on the road. A few yards away, the peace mission was stopped by 6 
  youths armed with grenades and machine guns. The peace mission was addressed 
  abusively and some were dragged out of their vehicles. The peace mission was 
  left stranded without even their baggage. The vehicle which followed them, together 
  with the two hijacked vehicles returned towards Pallai. The parting shot from 
  the hijackers was, &quot;We are Rajan's group (E.N.D.L.F.).&quot; If one could 
  play the game, so can two. What the E.N.D.L.F. did south of Elephant Pass, the 
  L.T.T.E. did to the north, putting the blame on the E.N.D.L.F.. It was generally 
  known that North of Elephant Pass was territory jealously controlled by the 
  L.T.T.E.. Members of the peace mission caught a South bound bus after walking 
  two miles towards Elephant Pass.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>The treatment of the mission 
  was in tune with the course the L.T.T.E. was taking. The mission came on an 
  invitation made by the L.T.T.E. sometime previously. If the L.T.T.E. had changed 
  its mind on the usefulness of well disposed Sinhalese, it could have told them 
  not to come. But to have them, talk to them nicely and treat them in this manner 
  at parting was a rather prolix way of saying: &quot;We have finished with you. 
  Do not bother to come again.&quot; The action had the L.T.T.E.'s stamp on it. 
  If the L.T.T.E. ever needed Sinhalese friends again, such as after their war 
  with India, its leaders would have no difficulty. All they would need to do 
  is blame such actions and the killings of Sinhalese on some hot heads who had 
  since been disciplined, and then resume relationships as though nothing untoward 
  had happened.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>To Mr. Shelton Ranaraja's 
  credit, when he answered questions in parliament, he was a sad, rather than 
  a bitter or angry man. Many Tamils like to blame the Indian offensive of October, 
  together with the killings of Sinhalese from 5 October on the Sri Lankan government. 
  They say that all the trouble was caused by the Sri Lankan government attempting 
  to transport 17 L.T.T.E. members to Colombo and provoking them into taking cyanide. 
  But the events which began on 13 September and the dramatic events described 
  above signalled what was coming. The L.T.T.E. had given up on trying to cultivate 
  Sinhalese friends. Its capacity to shock was one of the L.T.T.E.'s most potent 
  weapons. Friendship with the L.T.T.E. was a strange and self-flattering affair. 
  In the course of the coming days dire hints were dropped for the benefit of 
  several old friends who had for months sat on committees, given advice, drafted 
  letters, addressed meetings and had placed themselves at the L.T.T.E.'s beck 
  and call.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>A report written by the peace 
  mission for the Christian Worker (in the issues of the 2nd and 3rd quarters 
  of 1987) had the tone of reflective disillusionment: &quot;... It so appears 
  that the gun tends to evolve a logic of it own, turning its user into an extension 
  of itself... Rational thought and human communication are subsumed in the final 
  solution offered by the gun. We have already seen this on a massive scale in 
  Lebanon. Now do we ourselves have to go through a very personalised reproduction 
  of a similar situation where everybody seems to be shooting at everybody else? 
  Sri Lankan politics has always appeared to many as a pantomime. But now the 
  drama seems to be turning rapidly into a tragedy on a large scale. We can but 
  hope that firm action will avert it.&quot; Very prophetic words to be fulfilled 
  hardly a fortnight later.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>Before Thileepan lost consciousness, 
  he aired some of his religious hopes. He would go to a heavenly abode, he said, 
  where he would join the 650 or so martyrs from the L.T.T.E.. Then with the joy 
  that is reserved for these chosen ones, he would look down upon the land of 
  Tamil Eelam. There is little doubt that he believed in something like this undemocratic 
  and unegalitarian of creeds. It took some time for it to sink down that Thileepan 
  was dying a slow and excruciating death. It was presented in such a manner as 
  to touch the religious sensibilities of the Tamils. Being next to Kandasamy 
  Kovil, the scene was right for a momentous religious event. Saivite devotional 
  songs called Thevarams were sung. Sombre women with tear stained faces were 
  there. Over its television network Niedharshanam, the L.T.T.E. merged the images 
  of Thileepan and Mahatma Gandhi. Many were taken in. A Western diplomat who 
  visited the scene observed blankly, &quot;it looked to me like a stage set for 
  the Gandhi film.&quot;</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>The L.T.T.E. betrayed a misconception 
  of a non-violent struggle for which it can not be blamed. This misconception 
  was common even amongst educated Tamils. The Federal Party (the T.U.L.F.'s main 
  predecessor) launched a satyagraha campaign for Tamil rights in early 1961. 
  This took mainly the form of sit-ins in front of government offices in the North 
  and East, and long marches. There were mass meetings at which students queued 
  up to sign petitions in blood. The police made strenuous efforts for a few days 
  to disperse the crowds. But the crowds withstood the police baton charges. This 
  was an exhilarating moment. During the 1958 riots the Tamils had acquired a 
  reputation for being cowards who get beaten and run away. The helplessness of 
  the Tamils then seems to have inflamed the violent Sinhalese hoodlums to ask 
  for more blood. Many of the elderly in Colombo tasted the sting of racial violence. 
  In 1961 the Tamil satyagrahis had proved that the Tamils were as a people not 
  cowards. They were prepared to withstand pain and injury in order to win their 
  dignity and rights as equal citizens. Scenes of selfless courage were in evidence 
  everywhere. Men fell down on the road before military trucks and stayed their 
  ground until they were beaten and dragged senseless to a side. People were once 
  more proud to call themselves Tamils. After the first few days the then government 
  of Mrs. Bandaranaike's, decided to ignore the satyagraha campaign. The campaign 
  dragged on for 3 months and was ended by the imposition of a state of emergency 
  and the use of force that was mild by today's standards. An insider claimed 
  that the organisers were embarrassed by the prolongation of the campaign and 
  by difficulties in finding alternatives to government rice rations which were 
  stopped by the closure of the administration. They thus adopted measures such 
  as the printing of postage stamps and starting a mail service, which would compel 
  the government either to talk seriously or end the campaign by force. The government 
  chose the latter only to have the problem fester and erupt into violence a quarter 
  century later. It fell to another generation to revive the spirit of courage 
  and self sacrifice. Besides, in the use of methods there was another important 
  difference. In 1961 the people and their leaders stood together and suffered 
  voluntarily. Though the F.P. and the T.U.L.F. continued to claim non-violence 
  as a policy, they put off action for a future appropriate time in the future.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><i><span> </span>The result was a serious 
  general misunderstanding of non-violence. Non-violence and violence were regarded 
  as two alternative means to the same political end. Only the latter may need 
  plenty of money and prove more hurtful. That they morally meant two different 
  things was lost sight of. All that seemed to be required was to find the most 
  efficacious means disregarding moral implications</i><span
style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
letter-spacing:-.1pt'>. The most important aspect of non-violence was lost sight 
  of - that of self-purification together with honesty and integrity even in small 
  things; that it involved love and respect for life rather than a coward's desire 
  to avoid inflicting pain because of the trouble that may result. In consequence, 
  once people got through with sitting in front of the Kachcheri, the old bad 
  ways continued. Nor did they love the Sinhalese any better for it. The rich 
  lording it over and humiliating the poor, caste pride, spiritual, administrative, 
  and physical thuggery, all continued as before only to become worse with time.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><i><span> </span>When things went on in 
  this manner it was to be expected that non-violence would be discredited in 
  the eyes of the young while in fact it had never been tried. Young militants 
  in the 1980's too may be forgiven for uttering with brazen confidence that non-violence 
  had been rejected by the people as unworkable. Whether violence worked was a 
  question few bothered to ask. The misconception was evident when the L.T.T.E. 
  claimed that it was supreme master in the use of violent as well as nonviolent 
  means and that it was equally at home in both methods. That it was master of 
  violence was an accepted fact. Thileepan's ordeal was now proving to the masses 
  that the L.T.T.E. was also master of non-violence. Violence and non-violence 
  were here being treated as morally indistinct tools. Even amongst those who 
  were against the L.T.T.E.'s violence, Thileepan's fast touched sensitive chords</i><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";letter-spacing:-.1pt'>.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>But the scenario being gradually 
  built up by the L.T.T.E. was an essentially violent one. Crowds marching to 
  Nallur from distant places were made to shout menacing slogans by loudspeaker 
  cars. Prominent among the slogans were: &quot;Prabhakaran is our leader,&quot; 
  and &quot;If Thileepan dies, Tamil Eelam will become an exploding volcano.&quot; 
  The first kept Mr. Prabhakaran in the picture while the limelight was on Thileepan. 
  No one knew what exactly the second meant. Those who closely watched the proceedings 
  at Kandasamy temple, came away with different impressions. Some praised Thileepan's 
  determination. Some blamed the L.T.T.E. of deliberately putting Thileepan through 
  the ordeal of a slow and painful death. There were allusions that Thileepan 
  himself had left instructions while he was still in his proper senses, that 
  should he ask for water as weakness made him lose control over his will; such 
  a request should be ignored. However, everyone hoped that Prabhakaran would 
  take pity and order the fast called off. This was not to be. Prabhakaran's position 
  remained that the fast had been voluntarily undertaken to secure five demands 
  make to the Indians. Therefore India will be fully responsible for Thileepan's 
  fate. Whatever Thileepan had decided, an element of complexity was revealed 
  when a community leader raised with a senior L.T.T.E. official the question 
  of reviving Thileepan who was by now unconscious. He was told that they had 
  taken a final decision on the matter. The external factors seemed to suggest 
  that this was the case. This surmise would be strengthened when 12 L.T.T.E. 
  men committed suicide on 5 October. It looked as if the L.T.T.E. had decided 
  that Tamil Eelam should become a burning volcano.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>In the meantime the Indians 
  had started a series of talks with the L.T.T.E.. Those on the Indian side included 
  the High Commissioner Mr. Dixit, his deputy Mr. Sen and Lt. General Depinder 
  Singh, Chief of the Indian Army's Southern Command. Those representing the L.T.T.E. 
  included Prabhakaran, Balasingam and Sri Mahattaya. By all accounts it was not 
  cocktail diplomacy. It was like schoolmaster India attempting to verbally lash 
  into line an incorrigible schoolboy whom he would like thrown out but cannot. 
  Mr. Dixit must have found Ceylon a strange place in which to practise Parisian 
  diplomatic etiquette. A senior minister in the government in Colombo of the 
  gentler kind, once reportedly complained to a friend after meeting Mr. Dixit: 
  &quot;I felt like having been treated like a pick-pocket in my own home.&quot;</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>The L.T.T.E. was evidently 
  pressing for majority representation in an interim council for the North and 
  East, which given the circumstances would be around for a long time. This elicited 
  Dixit's remark: &quot;Interim is interim.&quot; The L.T.T.E. evidently wanted 
  elections put off for a long time. The L.T.T.E. had also expressed a wish to 
  have control over Police and Colonisation. The Indians had strongly objected 
  to the use of the press to whip up anti-Indian feeling. On this matter as pointed 
  out earlier, the Indians seemed unable to think of an alternative to pummelling 
  the L.T.T.E.. They were not thinking in terms of a direct approach to the people. 
  In depending totally on their ability to awe or bully the L.T.T.E. into line, 
  they were walking on miry ground. A journalist who was present described a scene 
  where Depinder Singh challenged the L.T.T.E. concerning freedom of the press 
  in Jaffna. He was assured that it was indeed free. General Singh then asked 
  if a statement given by him would be published. Thinking perhaps that Gen. Singh 
  wished to address the people, the L.T.T.E. readily agreed. Then Gen. Singh pulled 
  out a letter from his pocket and asked sternly if it would be published. The 
  letter was from the father of Douglas Devananda, a senior E.P.R.L.F. leader, 
  whose brother Premananda was kidnapped shortly after the Accord. There was an 
  embarrassed silence. Gen. Singh continued, saying that there was sometimes censorship 
  in India. But what prevailed in Jaffna was unheard of. Gen. Singh hardly knew 
  of the Indian censorship that would descend on Jaffna after October 1987.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>The L.T.T.E. organised a big 
  demonstration on Thursday, 24 September, 1987, when processions converged on 
  Jaffna Fort to present petitions to the I.P.K.F.. The crowds were basically 
  emotional and had little understanding of the issues involved. An Indian officer 
  who was receiving petitions, suddenly unrolled a large map of Ceylon. He asked 
  those present: &quot;You are complaining strongly about Sinhalese colonisation. 
  Show us exactly where it is taking place and we will put a stop to it.&quot; 
  There was some confusion and puzzlement. Some hesitantly pointed to places. 
  The women at the demonstration were being quite expressive. One woman with a 
  loud voice referred to the Indian Prime Minister as &quot;The dog born of Indira&quot;. 
  The Indian officer turned to a senior engineering foreman who was there and 
  asked him: &quot;Why are your people so angry and insulting towards us?&quot; 
  The engineering foreman tried to reassure him: &quot;Some may express their 
  feelings too strongly. But we would always love India. India is our mother.&quot;</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>In the light of what happened 
  later, it may be well to reflect here on the feelings of Indian soldiers. Most 
  of the latter were from very poor backgrounds. When they arrived in Ceylon, 
  they had a vague idea that they had come to protect Tamils from the Sri Lankan 
  army. They had also expected to see a pitifully downtrodden population. But 
  what they saw in Jaffna was contrary to expectations. There was little to do 
  in the way of protecting Tamils. After the Accord, the Sri Lankan army were 
  only too happy to behave themselves. Instead of uniform unrelieved, poverty, 
  there was a fairly large well-to-do middle-class. Most people dressed well and 
  lived in reasonable comfort. Unlike in India where each village may have just 
  one television set, every other home in Jaffna had colour television. Shops 
  were stocked with modern Japanese goods. Most homes had their wells, their water 
  sealed lavatories and electricity supply as a bare minimum. They wondered why 
  the Indian government had made such a fuss about Jaffna. Indian propaganda must 
  have surely had a bewildering effect on the Jawans<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span> 
  [1] </span></a><sup>1</sup> . In its twists and turns, one day the L.T.T.E. 
  would be a murderous evil force. Soon afterwards they would become gallant men 
  of vision.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>When the I.P.K.F. first arrived, 
  soldiers expressed their surprise. Tamil Nadu Jawans observed with wonder: &quot;This 
  is a fertile place.&quot; Malayali Jawans said to the effect: &quot;This place 
  reminds us of Kerala.&quot; Those from North India perhaps thought that this 
  was a strange place which was vaguely like the South. Only the shops reminded 
  them of what is said about Singapore. For the first few weeks, the I.P.K.F. 
  was preoccupied with the shops in Kasturiar Road. The officers bought Japanese 
  TV sets, video recorders and 3-in-1's. The Jawans looked for radio-cassettes, 
  pen torches and ball point pens. As the weeks went by, some Jawans told civilians: 
  &quot;We thought we came to protect you from the Sinhalese. But all we see is 
  your boys killing each other. We do not see any Sinhalese.&quot; The colonisation 
  problem too did not make sense to Indian soldiers. They found it difficult to 
  appreciate the problem of state sponsored colonisation. They would say: &quot;What 
  is the difficulty with Sinhalese in your areas? In India we have Tamil Nadu 
  people in Maharashtra, Maharashtra people in Delhi, Delhi people in Karnataka 
  and so on. There is no difficulty in that!&quot; With Thileepan's fast, people 
  were instigated by the L.T.T.E. to insult and humiliate Indian soldiers. Soldiers 
  from Punjab and Rajasthan who had no stake in what was going on here, no understanding 
  and cared even less, were ordered to put on a stiff upper lip and take it all, 
  much against their natural impulses. Their anger is not hard to imagine: &quot;First 
  we were asked to come and save these people. We then find that these people 
  were quite well off and lived much better than our people. They start killing 
  each other and now come and throw stones at and insult us for no conceivable 
  reason. Moreover they have the cheek to do this after eating our food.&quot;</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>Anyone would have known the 
  consequences of the L.T.T.E.'s pushing an army smarting under such provocation 
  into military action. After turning Tamil Eelam into a burning volcano, Prabhakaran 
  would say with disarming gravity: &quot;Now that we have been compelled to defend 
  ourselves militarily, India must assume full responsibility for whatever ill 
  befalls the civilian population.&quot;</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>When it became clear that 
  Thileepan would die and that the likelihood of volcanic eruptions in Jaffna 
  could not be dismissed, guessing was on as to how this would happen. Speculation 
  and fear became ripe in certain quarters on the basis of a brick dropped in 
  the hospital by a person considered fairly high up in the L.T.T.E.. He reportedly 
  dropped dark hints about the fate that would overtake those officials who garlanded 
  the Indian Red Cross, in the event of Thileepan's dying. The list of those who 
  welcomed the Indian Red Cross included besides the L.T.T.E., many of the senior 
  doctors, senior government officials and members of the Jaffna Citizens' Committee. 
  The existence of a threat was not taken lightly. These and other persons in 
  the administrative and academic elite who had earlier thought that their relationship 
  with the L.T.T.E., though uncomfortable, was fair, were keeping their fingers 
  crossed.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>Thileepan died on Saturday, 
  26 September, the 12th day of his fast. On the same morning it had been announced 
  that the negotiations had borne fruit. This may be an important reason why the 
  death did not lead to an eruption. The crowd at the Nallur Kandasamy Kovil watched, 
  tense but silent, as a doctor felt Thileepan's pulse. The doctor motioned Thileepan's 
  father to cry. The people standing around were then urged to cry. The whole 
  crowd wept. The tension was defused. Not a stone was thrown. Not a vehicle burnt. 
  The moment of Thileepan's exit was touchingly dignified. Old Gandhians who had 
  thought that non-violence was dead were profoundly moved. They even started 
  saying confidently that Thileepan was different from the rest. He was not responsible 
  for acts of violence, they added. The solemn manner in which the crowd received 
  the news of his death, they hoped, was a sure sign that the Tamils had turned 
  back to the old Gandhian way of non-violence. Thileepan's family too almost 
  certainly believed this. They contacted an old Gandhian to write an appreciation. 
  It was gladly done and it echoed these sentiments. It seemed bad taste to strike 
  a discordant note. Even those whose experience of Thileepan had not been of 
  the pleasant kind would not say otherwise. Whether a voluntary act, an act of 
  supreme obedience or an act of unprobed complexity, Thileepan's death excited 
  awe. Perhaps, many in torture cells had died more painful and more heroic deaths, 
  even in militant ruled Jaffna. But publicity made the difference. Columnists 
  in the South who were no friends of the L.T.T.E.'s, could not resist a hint 
  of admiration. Lucien Rajakarunayake writing in the Sunday Times of 4 October, 
  1987, compared Thileepan favourably with the chauvinists of the South who were 
  eternally promising to shed the last drop of their blood before the first in 
  the cause of Sinhalese supremacy, all the way down from the days of the Bhasa 
  Twins - Jayasuriya and Rajaratne. Lucian Rajakarunayake went on: </p>
<p style='
text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";letter-spacing:-.1pt'>&quot;I 
  do not agree with Thileepan's cause, nor have I ever agreed with the similarly 
  motivated causes of most others on this side who have threatened death fasts 
  or begun great walks for peace with lottery tickets on the sideline. However, 
  one cannot help but be impressed by the extent of political dedication, even 
  misguided, when a slow death is courted by one, when others are satisfied watching 
  the other man's son die for the success of their selfish slogans.</span></p>
<p style='
text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";letter-spacing:-.1pt'>&quot;Mind 
  you, if the Sinhalese begin to ask their politicians and other racial champions, 
  who make such loud noises and promises of sacrifice on public platforms, if 
  they are prepared to go half the distance Thileepan went in hunger, it may help 
  get rid of the political poseurs who strut about in the garb of Sinhalese heroes, 
  and by the curious identification of the majority only with the nation, as national 
  heroes, as well.&quot;</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>When the agreement reached 
  between India and the L.T.T.E. was announced on Monday, 28 September, after 
  obtaining the Sri Lankan President's concurrence, it had little to say on the 
  5 demands put forward over Thileepan's fast. The membership of the interim council 
  was increased from 8 to 12 and the L.T.T.E.'s representation increased from 
  3 to 7, giving it a majority. The L.T.T.E. agreed in writing to submit 15 names, 
  including 3 for the chairman, from which the President of Sri Lanka would choose 
  the required number. The people were relieved.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>Why then did Thileepan die? 
  That was a question for which no satisfactory explanation could be found. From 
  the point of view of Tamils as a whole, the actual results were hardly a gain. 
  Even in the council of 8 proposed earlier, the Tamils would have been in the 
  majority, amongst whom there would have been a convergence of views on key issues. 
  The difference in the new agreement was a majority for the L.T.T.E. by itself, 
  until the mandatory elections were held. The only concrete achievement was a 
  demonstration by the L.T.T.E. that its power to sour things for anyone choosing 
  to act without its consent was hardly to be scoffed at.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>Thileepan had not suddenly 
  changed to non-violence. He was very much a part of the violent scene, as leader 
  of the political wing of the L.T.T.E. in Jaffna. But he was a dedicated L.T.T.E. 
  man who had spent the prime of his life in its service. It would be truly remarkable 
  if he had knowingly thrown away his life for such meagre returns. Jaffna is 
  a place where cynicism has reigned for so long that nothing is taken at face 
  value. There have been several cases of persons in militant groups who had become 
  frustrated and who simply carried on for the lack of an alternative, caring 
  little whether they lived or died. There are those who would assume that Thileepan 
  was one of them. A more plausible explanation coming from some others is that 
  when the fast was undertaken, Thileepan was not told that he would die. Even 
  if nothing was coming in the way of response to the demands, Prabhakaran could 
  solemnly call off the fast in deference to the wishes of the people. Once Thileepan 
  had started fasting on a public platform, he had little control over events. 
  Whatever he wished, the decision was left to others.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>It is perhaps uncharitable 
  to speculate on the motives of dead men. Whatever was in Thileepan's mind, the 
  cynicism of others cannot be discounted. On the testimony of those who knew 
  Thileepan, he was certainly capable of sacrificing himself for a cause in which 
  he believed. He was certainly not a non-violent man. As late as 2 July, 1987, 
  Thileepan took part in a lamp-post killing at Urumpirai junction. During the 
  fast he gave expression to the L.T.T.E.'s religious creed. Thileepan was seriously 
  wounded in the abdomen during the Vadamaratchi operation. It is known that, 
  at least after this, he was emotionally sensitive.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>Shortly before his final fast, 
  Thileepan went to the Eelanadu office to complain about an editorial which had 
  said: &quot;Whether the Elephant comes or the Tiger comes, the Accord must be 
  implemented.&quot; The elephant is the symbol of the ruling party, U.N.P..The 
  senior person who was on duty that night told him with some force: &quot;You 
  have misunderstood this. You know the editor is a reasonable and highly respected 
  man who was principal of your old school (Jaffna Hindu College). If you talk 
  to him, he will explain things to you.&quot; Thileepan stared at the ground 
  for some time. He then exclaimed: &quot;Do not crush us,&quot; and walked away. 
  This encounter betrayed a feeling amongst the Tigers that the Tamil people who 
  once gave them flattering devotion were now distancing themselves - hence the 
  need for desperate measures. The Thileepan of September 1987 was not the same 
  Thileepan who stood four square at the University during a peace meeting in 
  mid 1986, arrogantly insisting on the paramountcy of the L.T.T.E.. His words 
  had then come not from the logic of Tamil unity or Tamil well being, but from 
  the logic of power. Given this new emotional sensitivity, how did changes within 
  the L.T.T.E. affect him? A journalist who was Thileepan's class mate at Jaffna 
  Hindu College and also knew Yogi who was a little senior to them both, had this 
  to say: &quot;Thileepan was from the time I knew him, a man with dedication. 
  He did fully believe in the cause of the Tamil militancy.&quot; This journalist, 
  who is not an L.T.T.E. sympathiser, had little doubt that Thileepan died more 
  or less voluntarily. Yogi's association with the L.T.T.E. in London was relatively 
  brief. His main asset was that he was the elder brother of the late Kugan, Prabhakaran's 
  deputy, whom Prabhakaran trusted completely. Unlike Yogi, Thileepan had been 
  on the ground during a difficult period and had served loyally for a long time. 
  Those who would like to pin on Thileepan, the image of an orthodox Gandhian 
  martyr or even that of the unquestioning obedient servant, would probably do 
  him injustice as a human being with human feelings. Amongst ordinary people, 
  there was much sympathy for Thileepan and not all of it was complimentary to 
  Prabhakaran. However, Thileepan was soon to be forgotten amidst other events.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><b>9.3 Towards Confrontation</b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'>The L.T.T.E. expressed dissatisfaction when it 
  submitted fifteen names for the interim council and the President made his choice. 
  Mr. N. Pathmanathan, Additional Government Agent, Trincomalee, whom the L.T.T.E. 
  had named as its first choice for the chairmanship of the Interim Council was 
  dropped in favour of Mr. C.V.K. Sivagnanam, Municipal Commissioner, Jaffna. 
  Amongst those remaining there was no one from the Eastern Province, although 
  the L.T.T.E. had submitted the name of an Eastern Province Muslim and others 
  from the East amongst the 7 leading names. Mr. Sivagnanam, reportedly under 
  pressure, sent a letter turning down the appointment. It appeared to most Tamils 
  that the President had made his choice in such a way as would alienate the Tamils 
  and Muslims in the East from the northern Tamils. Moreover, N. Pathmanathan 
  was an experienced and competent administrator. Mr. Sivagnanam's main achievement 
  was to perform the demanding task of being the government's commissioner in 
  an L.T.T.E. dominated Jaffna. He seldom displeased anyone, was not known for 
  any particular principled stand, but had a mind of his own on certain matters. 
  He could move with decision where his own ambitions could be made to fit the 
  aims of the powerful interest groups he had to contend with. To many, the manner 
  in which the L.T.T.E. looked upon his appointment, was a revelation about its 
  relationships with public men.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>N. Pathmanathan had been released 
  from prison on 2 September, 1987, after being detained for 45 months under the 
  prevention of terrorism act. He was a Grade 1 C.A.S. (Ceylon Administrative 
  Service) officer who had served as the Additional Government Agent, Trincomalee 
  under a Grade 2 Sinhalese officer. He was arrested in December 1983 and was 
  notified of his charge more than 2 years later. The charge was peculiar to the 
  P.T.A. and did not involve any first or second hand criminal act. The crime 
  involved was the alleged provision of help for some Tamil prisoners who had 
  escaped from Batticaloa prison. Pathmanathan is said to have been in the know 
  of some person who in turn was in the know of such help being given! Pathmanathan 
  was not taken to trial. He was detained for much longer than the mandatory limit 
  of 18 months in the hope that he would plead guilty. Pathmanathan was determined 
  not to plead guilty to something he had not done. While in prison he studied 
  law and interested himself in the welfare of other prisoners who were utterly 
  innocent and were languishing in prison because the system moved clumsily and 
  many of the prisoners did not have the money to do the needful. His determination 
  was such that the government had to drop the charges and release him. A senior 
  civil servant who had worked with Pathmanathan stated that, &quot;he was an 
  extremely intelligent man and a committed Tamil.&quot;</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>It is understandable that 
  the President did not wish to elevate such a man to the chairmanship of the 
  interim council. It is interesting that the same device of asking for a list 
  of names in place of one nominee is used to avoid appointing inconvenient vice-chancellors 
  of Universities. The Indian High Commissioner held that the L.T.T.E. was wrong 
  to complain as the matter had been explained to them and they had agreed in 
  writing. The Tamil public felt cheated. But the L.T.T.E. had little reason to 
  complain. Many would contend that Mr. Dixit had taken for a ride a ragged group 
  of fighting men who were innocent of legal matters. Such a charge would not 
  hold water as the L.T.T.E. had all the legal advice it needed at its disposal. 
  They had the services of two lawyers, one of whom at least was recognised as 
  competent and experienced. Anton Balasingam had held an academic post in Philosophy 
  in Britain. Yogi was a student in Britain. It is unbelievable that they were 
  unable to sort out among themselves, the consequences of what the L.T.T.E. was 
  putting down in writing. Mr. Dixit may not have been excessively polite towards 
  the L.T.T.E.. He may have been overconfident that he could handle them, or perhaps 
  he hid his uncertainties beneath a facade of contempt. It was natural that he 
  should feel more at home with the Colombo elite, whose first language and background 
  he shared. Understanding what motivated them, his success with them had been 
  remarkable, even when his office changed from Ambassador to Proconsul. He had 
  perhaps at least begun to understand the L.T.T.E. when he advised President 
  Jayewardene against transporting the 17 L.T.T.E. captives.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>It is in all likelihood unfair 
  to accuse Mr. Dixit of conniving with President Jayewardene over the appointments 
  to the Interim Council. It is far more likely that he did the job of a negotiator 
  who was anxious to avoid trouble. An agreement already existed between India 
  and the President on the composition and method of appointment. Mr. Dixit would 
  have had to ask the President to concede a little more in agreeing to an L.T.T.E. 
  majority. The President conceded this much with some stipulations about the 
  method of appointment. When the L.T.T.E. objected to the President's choice, 
  it is reliably learnt that the President agreed to the L.T.T.E. revising the 
  list, giving them the option of securing a chairman from the East by submitting 
  all three names from the East. However the President could have gone further. 
  He had little to lose in agreeing to the L.T.T.E.'s intended nominees.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>Such omissions by President 
  Jayewardene far from absolve India from the unprincipled character of its overall 
  handling of the Ceylon Tamil question which helped to bring about the current 
  impasse. Dixit, however, had his share of responsibility in India's cynical 
  use of Ceylon's Tamil problem. Then came an unexpected problem, not uncommonly 
  encountered in such unprincipled dealings. The L.T.T.E. acquired an autonomy 
  of its own -- shades of Bhindranwale and the Punjab. Relationships were already 
  complicated by mistrust and mutual cynicism. When the government in Colombo 
  agreed to fall in line, what was on offer was not enough for the L.T.T.E.. This 
  was a problem that India seemed incapable of tackling competently. There are 
  those who attach much importance to claims by the L.T.T.E. concerning verbal 
  promises made by India. Prabhakaran reportedly claims that Rajiv Gandhi assured 
  him that the L.T.T.E. could keep its arms after a token surrender of some arms. 
  Another claim much talked about concerns Tamil Nadu minister Pandruti Ramachandran. 
  He allegedly assured the L.T.T.E. that, although they would have to send in 
  15 names for the 7 seats on the interim council, the leading names would be 
  selected. The second has been discussed earlier. As for the first, even if such 
  a promise was made, the end result intended was clear. No armed group was eventually 
  going to be tolerated. The L.T.T.E. could not have been mistaken about that. 
  Given the present reputation of the Indian government, it cannot be put past 
  Messrs. Gandhi and Ramachandran to have made such promises.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>Other reports of a secret 
  package agreed to between the L.T.T.E. and the Indian government surfaced in 
  the London Observer of Sunday, 3 April, 1988. The report filed by Dhiren Bhagat 
  from Colombo quoted Indian High Commissioner Mr. J.N.Dixit. It stated that funds 
  amounting to 200,000 pounds sterling a month (Rs. 5 million) were to be paid 
  to the L.T.T.E.. The funds were to be paid for the maintenance of L.T.T.E. members 
  until normal life returned to war ravaged areas. The Jaffna peninsula was to 
  receive Indian economic aid amounting to 43 million pounds sterling. The report 
  quotes Mr. Dixit as having said that the monthly payment was made for the month 
  of August (1987). The L.T.T.E. is said to have resumed secret talks with India 
  on the subject of new financial arrangements. The initial agreement is said 
  to have been reached between Prabhakaran and Rajiv Gandhi in New Delhi at the 
  end of July 1987.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>The same report quoted the 
  L.T.T.E. spokesman in Madras as saying that the payment was part of a larger 
  package of guarantees to secure his co-operation in implementing the Indo-Lanka 
  Accord. The package of guarantees is said to have included: A majority of the 
  L.T.T.E. in the interim Provincial Council; one billion rupees economic assistance 
  to the Jaffna peninsula for rehabilitation to be undertaken by the L.T.T.E. 
  dominated Interim Council; and help to form a Tamil Police Force after the establishment 
  of the interim council. The L.T.T.E. spokesman had characterised this as a gentlemen's 
  agreement with the Indians. One wonders why hundreds have to die while gentlemen 
  played their pecuniary games. Whilst big money was being talked about in high 
  places, ordinary civilians were being assassinated for innocuous and sometimes 
  necessary dealings with the army of the same India. Some who got threatening 
  notes were those who sold things such as tomatoes to soldiers for a few tens 
  of rupees.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>This report about the money 
  sounds plausible as it fits into the general pattern of things and has been 
  corroborated by Reuters and the Times of India. It may not amount to anything 
  sinister as the press in the South tries to make out. It is not inconsistent 
  with India's pledge to secure the L.T.T.E.'s compliance with the Accord. It 
  makes it even more unlikely that India was set on a one track course to destroy 
  the L.T.T.E.. India would certainly have kept several options open. Even after 
  the war India kept making approaches to secure the L.T.T.E.'s compliance. One 
  could say with certainty that if the L.T.T.E. had moved to confess past errors 
  and to seek a solid democratic base amongst the people, India would have found 
  it prudent to leave them alone. That the L.T.T.E. had to look for its security 
  in secret and undemocratic deals with a foreign power, rather than in the trust 
  of the people was a sign of its weakness. This makes all that followed even 
  more inexcusable.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>Apologists for the L.T.T.E. 
  like to pick on such straws in the wind as the events surrounding the deportation 
  on 5 October, and represent these as turning points in the tragic drama resulting 
  from Indian and Sri Lankan perfidy. But the fabric of the tragedy was woven 
  by the intermingling of the failings of the different actors. Lying, deceit 
  and massacres are its various threads. It would be mere caprice to represent 
  isolated events as turning points.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>Granted that the Indian and 
  Sri Lankan states are flawed affairs; anyone who aspired to lead the Tamils 
  must be judged very harshly if these flaws are held up as adequate grounds for 
  knowingly flinging the entire Tamil community into the fire. In mitigation however, 
  the L.T.T.E. is the product of a brutal world; a world where great leaders, 
  men whose education and maturity entitle them to know far better, routinely 
  use deceit and mass murder as legitimate forms of action. This can be seen in 
  the American use of Contra rebels in Nicaragua and in the Soviet meddling and 
  the shifting of sides in Eritrea. That President Reagan delegates authority 
  to decide on murder and assassination to distant C.I.A. officials or proxies 
  does not make him less of a murderer than a bandit who makes his own decisions. 
  The same can be said of most big nations which observe little restraint in the 
  way of law or principle when dealing with foreigners, especially by proxy. The 
  R.A.W. cannot claim moral superiority over the Tamil militant groups. The fight 
  against terrorism will be futile as long as the world's leaders play with terror 
  when it suits them. The impressionable young minds of the L.T.T.E. were moulded 
  by the cynicism and duplicity they encountered in their dealings -- with the 
  T.U.L.F., the Tamil elite, and the Sri Lankan and Indian authorities. They concluded 
  that the way to success was to outdo the others in these qualities. They realised 
  unforeseen success and forgot the original cause. The Tamil people who could 
  have exerted the corrective influence and have ensured that the right men became 
  leaders were themselves lost and became directionless.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>The uncertainty over the Interim 
  Council lasted a few days. Most people hoped that the matter would get sorted 
  out, at least by the L.T.T.E. accepting the present arrangement as a spring 
  board for more. Then came the affair of the 17 detainees and the decision by 
  the L.T.T.E. that Tamil Eelam should after all become a burning volcano. </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><b>9.4 The End of an Era.</b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";letter-spacing:-.1pt'>The 
  suicides of the twelve L.T.T.E. men in captivity have been dealt with separately. 
  Amongst them were Kumarappa and Pulendran. There was every prospect that they 
  would be released. The evidence seems to point that the decision the detainees 
  should take cyanide was taken by the L.T.T.E.'s top leadership. This brings 
  us to two questions. What motivated men like Kumarappa and Pulendran who had 
  reached their height of influence and power to throw away their lives so lightly? 
  The other question is, what do friendships with members of the L.T.T.E. really 
  mean? The L.T.T.E. is not a democratic organisation. Its members are under an 
  oath of personal loyalty to their leader Mr. Prabhakaran. This aspect of the 
  organisation was strengthened over time by a process of elimination. Those democratically 
  minded fell by the wayside, mostly by leaving the organisation. There is enough 
  pressure on ex-members of the organisation to remain passive. Those with the 
  organisational ability to challenge the L.T.T.E. must take even greater care. 
  It is then to be expected that those currently in positions of leadership in 
  the L.T.T.E. whether out of conviction or convenience take the oath of loyalty 
  to their leader seriously. Over time the workings of the organisations have 
  acquired religious, or even theological overtones. Conformity is also ensured 
  by a system of policing where every man is said to be the other man's spy. Kumarappa 
  was a man whose loyalty had been tested. When the L.T.T.E.'s Batticaloa leader 
  Kadavul refused to take on the TELO, the L.T.T.E. had to rely on Kumarappa and 
  Pottu. The smallest price to be paid for disobedience, for a person with no 
  means, may be some abject retirement. To many, this may be worse than death. 
  One person who perhaps came closest to defying Prabhakaran was Kittu. His fate 
  will long remain a matter of conjecture. This may, just perhaps, throw some 
  light on the fates of Kumarappa, Pulendran and even Thileepan.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>Going by human nature and 
  the unusual requirements of the type of organisation the L.T.T.E. is, the importance 
  of the system of policing together with rewards and punishments cannot be under-estimated. 
  It has been frequently found that the conduct of individual L.T.T.E. members 
  can vastly differ as individual persons and in a group. In the wake of the Indian 
  offensive of October, those L.T.T.E. members who were isolated by their families 
  were much readier to accept mediation and surrender. Many such persons surrendered. 
  A clergyman involved in social work observed: &quot;Several of the L.T.T.E. 
  boys who have their families in Jaffna are handing over their arms to boys from 
  outstation areas and are going to their families. Those from the outstations 
  are moving about with the rest in isolated pockets not knowing what to do and 
  out of communication with the leadership.&quot; One area leader in Jaffna gave 
  hints of wanting to surrender. Fear of punitive action weighed heavily on his 
  family. It was later reported that he fell in with some other members of his 
  group and had left Jaffna. Parathan, a leading member of the L.T.T.E.'s television 
  unit, was also regarded a hard man. Shortly before the Indian army's advance 
  into Nallur, he was observed alone in the Kandasamy temple area. He was going 
  from house to house and sometimes stopping motorcyclists on the road, pleading 
  with the owners for the loan of a 200 CC motorcycle. If a vehicle had been required 
  by the group, it could have been commandeered. Evidently, Parathan did not want 
  it publicised that he was looking for a vehicle.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>Malaravan, the former L.T.T.E. 
  leader of Ariyalai, was seen in the wake of the Indian advance, nestling like 
  a babe between his father and mother, in the back of a car parked in the precincts 
  of Kandasamy Kovil. Malaravan became notorious after beating to death a civilian, 
  Edward, in the Ariyalai camp in November 1986. It is very probable that Malaravan's 
  fate could have been different had his parents not been near at hand. It was 
  later reported the he was detained while being taken southwards to be sent abroad. 
  The facility to go abroad is again crucial in decisions to be taken by dissatisfied 
  militants. If many of the militants had been dissatisfied, it would have cost 
  the Sri Lankan government only Rs. 0.2 billion out of its annual defence budget 
  of 15 billion (1.3%) to provide 2000 militants with the maximum Rs. 1 lakh that 
  each needed to go abroad. It gives one small aspect of the government's lack 
  of imagination.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>Without making unfair generalisations, 
  like in any organisation, the motivations of those who joined it are widely 
  different. In the case of the L.T.T.E. some would be motivated by ties of clan 
  or thirst for power, others by romance and many by a burning hatred of the government 
  for what it had done. Some joined just for a lark because others were doing 
  it and the community had little to offer in making routine life worthwhile. 
  Those most easily disillusioned are the ones who had the intention of doing 
  some good to the community. Such persons are likely to have independent ideas 
  and will be the least amenable to an oath of personal loyalty to the leader. 
  It was pointed out that most of the staff and students from the University of 
  Jaffna who joined the L.T.T.E. in the early 1980's dropped out. Prominent amongst 
  them were Mr. and Mrs. Nithiyanandan. The only person left from that lot is 
  Anton Sivakumar whose relationship with the L.T.T.E. is again chequered. The 
  best L.T.T.E. members are those who are caught young with impressionable minds, 
  with a simple joy in carrying a gun, a boyish thirst for romance and who have 
  no parents capable of influencing the child and of being a nuisance to the child's 
  career in the militancy. The latest additions are from amongst girls. Many Tamil 
  girls have a gloomy future resulting from the breakdown of a society where women 
  were dependent and where well above 100,000 young men have gone abroad. Numbers 
  connected with the militancy were far less - about 15,000 at best. Amongst girls, 
  again, motivations vary widely. Those most amenable to romance and whose tenure 
  is short are likely to come from secure middle class families. A large number 
  of girls joined the L.T.T.E. from lower middle class families from rural areas 
  such as Mullaitivu. These were from homes directly affected by Sri Lankan military 
  action. It was Prabhakaran's genius to weld all these diverse motivations into 
  an organisation where personal loyalty to him would be enforced. He had the 
  imagination to study people and use even those doubting persons who would at 
  least be formally independent. For some with literary talents, a smile and some 
  kind and flattering words from Prabhakaran were enough to secure their loyal 
  services.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>As for friendships with the 
  L.T.T.E., the evidence suggests that there was a very sincere element in many 
  of them. The friendship Kittu and Rahim formed with Captain Kotelawala of the 
  Ceylon army was genuine, and has gone on beyond its period of mere utility. 
  Kittu once reportedly came under criticism for preventing an L.T.T.E. sniper 
  from taking a pot-shot at Captain Kotelawela who was exposed while inspecting 
  positions around the Fort. Subsequently Kittu's party is said to have been fired 
  at by an army sniper. A senior L.T.T.E. leader once said that their relationship 
  with Captain Kotelawela was based on their mutual appreciation of each other 
  as professional soldiers. The close ties between Kittu and Rahim are again out 
  of character for an organisation where loyalty to the leader comes first. The 
  presence of both in Madras is regarded a kind of exile. Even after the strange 
  affair of Kittu losing a leg, he proved his usefulness as a field commander 
  in Jaffna during Operation Liberation where his mere presence was able to inspire 
  morale which had been failing amongst the ranks. The ties even extended to family 
  circles. Kittu's old mother from Valvettithurai, recently visited the family 
  of Rahim's intended bride in Nallur. Rahim is the last remaining in the L.T.T.E. 
  out of a group of 6 class-mates from St. John's College who joined in 1984; 
  the last to leave went abroad in September 1986 after being the Karainager leader. 
  Rahim's survival capacity is tied perhaps with his ability to avoid unpleasant 
  subjects in conversation. He displayed a touching desire to keep in touch with 
  old schoolmates when his application to join the St. John's College Old Boys 
  Association came before the committee in October 1987. Kittu can be crude, vulgar 
  and illogical (the logic of power that one sees in so many army officers) in 
  his appearances, and very inconsiderate to commoners who fall foul. But the 
  ties he sought with leaders in the South appear to have a genuine element. He 
  had that kind of erratic emotional bent. </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>Amongst the many murdered 
  while Kittu was in charge of Jaffna was the Jaffna P.L.O.T.E. leader, Mendis 
  (Wijayapalan). Mendis was regarded as a friend of Kittu's and was killed after 
  one month's captivity in January 1987 despite an assurance given to his family 
  that he would not be harmed. Mendis is accused of having helped several persons 
  wanted by the L.T.T.E. to escape to India. It is not known with certainty if 
  the decision to kill Mendis came from Kittu or from above. But significantly, 
  it took place within a few days of Prabhakaran's arrival in Jaffna. One may 
  hazard the guess that it would have been out of character for Kittu to have 
  treated Sinhalese visitors and prisoners in the way they were treated in September 
  and October 1987. This last decision appears to have been taken between Prabhakaran, 
  Balasingam and Mahattaya. Balasingam's influence in decision making may not 
  be of great importance. But the personal need Prabhakaran has of him seems to 
  have enabled him to safeguard his position. Balasingam, a former British High 
  Commission employee, who later wrote a doctoral thesis on Hegel, was a teacher 
  of political science at a British polytechnic. He could also converse ably on 
  philosophical subjects. After July 1983 he moved to Madras with his Australian 
  wife Adele to be full-time spokesman for the L.T.T.E.. His writings helped to 
  give the L.T.T.E. a Marxist image. But his real function was far less flattering. 
  In Prabhakaran's words, he was to &quot;explain rather than to direct the course 
  of armed struggle.&quot; His real significance stemmed from an emotional need 
  Prabhakaran had of him. The relationship was a stormy one. When drinking with 
  friends in Madras, Balasingam would sometimes say, &quot;Drink, friend, drink. 
  There is little else you can do when you are in an outfit like this.&quot; When 
  back on the job, his doubts would seem to vanish. His wife, a former member 
  of the British Communist party, would sometimes agree when others expressed 
  doubts about the state of things within the L.T.T.E., but after talking it over 
  with her husband, she would come back with her doubts cleared.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>Mahattaya had a childhood 
  steeped in want. He is very much a loner and is not much of a public man. Mahattaya 
  is once said to have had serious differences with Prabhakaran. These appear 
  to have been patched up. Those who befriended him in old times can perhaps claim 
  a hint of loyalty that did not quite approach friendship. He would be suspicious 
  of the kind of ties formed by Kittu.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>The ties of friendship between 
  Kumarappa and Indian army officers again appear to be genuine. He married after 
  the Accord and took his marital relationship seriously. The thought of death 
  in such a relationship cannot be uppermost in a person's mind. His was no ordinary 
  suicide, for he had cause to live. The day before he committed suicide, he told 
  an Indian officer he counted as a friend: &quot;You must see my wife today.&quot; 
  That has the fatal ring of a man who cares for his wife, but must yet bow to 
  an inexorable destiny. This perhaps demonstrates the nature of friendships with 
  men in the L.T.T.E.. Many of them are human in the ordinary sense. But they 
  are bound by an inexorable fate which draws them through either faith or fear 
  - perhaps both.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>This fate finds its embodiment 
  in their leader Veluppillai Prabhakaran. One aspect of his calls to mind some 
  kind of subcontinental cult god whose mighty will commands the rise of devotees 
  and later sends them obediently to their destruction. It is as though loyalty, 
  and blind obedience are one and the same thing to him. A common error in presenting 
  great figures of history is to glorify their military successes where they murdered 
  hundreds of thousands of their fellow men, and describe their ultimate failure 
  as incidental upon some miscalculation. Their seamy side and the destructive 
  process it engendered are lost sight of as the real cause of failure. Napoleon 
  on the one hand is the military genius, the victor of Austerlitz who with a 
  wave of his hand rolled back the combined forces of Austria, Prussia, Russia 
  and Britain. He was also the great actor who looking at the pyramids of Egypt 
  surveyed 5000 years of history. What are we to make of his hasty, ignominious 
  retreat from Moscow to Paris in record time in the winter of 1812, leaving his 
  harried men to face the ravages of the Russian winter? By romanticising him 
  we lose sight of the personal tragedy of the man, his spiritual emptiness, his 
  uncertainties and the reassurances he sought in the way of securing power over 
  other men. His mistake was not a misjudged attack on Russia. By 1810 France 
  was already creaking under the load of militarisation.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>Likewise one aspect of Mr. 
  Prabhakaran's case is fascinating. Using unpromising material his will forged 
  together a force, the L.T.T.E., which made the world sit up. A government in 
  Colombo which treated the Tamil problem with derision in 1978 and savagery in 
  1983 was shaken to its foundations. In time New Delhi too became unsure. Washington 
  took a keen interest. Where lesser mortals would have chosen to call it off, 
  Prabhakaran persisted for greater gain. All this required a ruthless will to 
  manipulate everything that came his way. </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>It was now the end of an era. 
  A struggle that had, in its dawn, been fired by several noble ideals, and called 
  forth courage and much sacrifice from young persons irrespective of group, had 
  now reached a point where the community was powerless and voiceless. How long 
  could a military force that claimed to represent them retain any degree of real 
  autonomy with such a weak base ? In the interests of sheer survival, people 
  would have to dispense with standards and ideals and become immune to the loss 
  of life. In time, with children becoming militarised with hardly any voice raised 
  from within the community, even the last links on our hold on civilisation are 
  put into question.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>What went wrong ? Had we been 
  led by a casual acceptance of violence as a tool to disregard the value of all 
  life ?</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>One last scene impresses itself 
  on the mind. The scene was the playing field of the University of Jaffna at 
  dusk on 13 October, 1987. The Indians had blundered a first landing near the 
  University the day before. Sentries were now posted everywhere. A line of women 
  stood with guns around the field. They epitomised the hopelessness that has 
  beset many Tamil women. Their faces were blank as if they cared little whether 
  they lived or died. They had little resemblance to Joan of Arc or to the Parisian 
  women who stormed the Bastille. One of them said in a quiet voice that betrayed 
  no emotion: &quot;Please close the gate when you go.&quot; A tear was not out 
  of place.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><b>9.5 A Digression on the Forces of History</b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";letter-spacing:-.1pt'>With 
  all our limitations (not one of us among this group of writers is an academic 
  historian) and with all our differences in views, we have in a way tried to 
  do what Thucydides did for the Pelopponesian war 2500 years ago - the debilitating 
  war between Athens and Sparta which ended Greek supremacy of the Mediterranean 
  world. What we have offered is a series of reflections and accounts of our own 
  situation. We too have to come to terms with a world that has been changed by 
  these events. We hope we have offered something towards understanding these 
  events and, thus, towards changing our lot for the better.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>One debate that will go on 
  is whether there is a form of armed struggle that will bring about freedom and 
  democracy or if violence is to be entirely abhorred and the struggle is only 
  to be towards creating (on a large scale) the personal virtues of honesty and 
  a love for truth, together with a willingness to suffer for them. And if the 
  latter, whether it is consistent to confine nonviolence to human beings only 
  or if it should be extended to the animal kingdom as well. Those who admit the 
  possible use of force would maintain that i. they are not advocating it for 
  the love of it; ii. violence is part of the day to day reality of this world; 
  and iii. it would be sheer irresponsibility to blind oneself to it and leave 
  its use entirely in the hands of anti-social or criminal elements. Moreover 
  they would say, that at the end of the day, the objective reality is determined 
  by those who have the guns.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>Those who disagree will say 
  that there is a subjective element in judging the fruits of violence. Apart 
  from the evils of war, there is also the long term damage to the psyche. There 
  is also the question of the time frame. The idealism of Lenin gave way to the 
  purges of Stalin - perhaps the largest act of mass murder in the history of 
  mankind, exceeding even Hitler's acts against Jews. Did not the legitimacy given 
  to the revolution by dedicated revolutionaries like Lenin, pave the way for 
  the passive acceptance of the arbitrary acts of Stalin? Did the journey from 
  Tsar Nicholas II to Mikhail Gorbachev have to pass through the purges of Stalin?</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>To this may come the reply 
  that we are not in a position to sit back and judge history as though it could 
  have been otherwise. It was made by those who grasped the opportunities of the 
  moment. There is always room for others to mismanage things later. We will be 
  judged severely if we do not grasp the opportunities of our time and choose 
  to run away from them.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>It may then be replied that 
  life has gone this far on the assumption that force is necessary. Its use has 
  an honoured place in human culture. But misery has persisted and even increased, 
  to a point that unless we can create a culture where force is outside normal 
  reckoning, mass suicide may become a reality. What is absurd to human reason 
  may become a reality in another realm. Perhaps a search for and the surrender 
  to God may be the only option we have left. Are not after all, all the sophisticated 
  theories of revolution leak-proofed to the point of becoming esoteric creations? 
  They are never proved false because the initial conditions are somehow never 
  right. Ask anyone who has lived through a revolution! In the academic world, 
  a moral interpretation of history would be treated as naive. But this was the 
  standpoint adopted by many historians through the ages who felt a burning desire 
  to communicate what they believed to be the truth - down from the prophets of 
  ancient Israel and Thucydides. In fact, F.M. Cornford, a widely respected Greek 
  scholar has this to say in his essay titled The Unconscious Element in Literature 
  and Philosophy: &quot;Now this is not to say that Thucydides' philosophy of 
  life is not, within its limits, a true philosophy - as true as any alternative 
  our own minds may contribute. It may even be truer. Fourteen years ago, writing 
  under the impression of the South African war (Boer war, 1898 - 1900), I may 
  have overstressed the financial aspect of imperialism. Since 1914 (First World 
  War) Thucydides' moral interpretation of history has seemed more profound.&quot;
