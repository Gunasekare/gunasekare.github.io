<p align=center style='text-align:center;'><b><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;'>THE JULY 1983 VIOLENCE AGAINST TAMILS</span></b></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>The mood of the government was reflected in a pronouncement 
  President Jayewardene made during the course of an interview he gave Graham 
  Ward of the Daily Telegraph, published in the issue of 18 July 1983. He said: 
  &quot;I am not worried about the opinion of the Jaffna people now... Now we 
  cannot think of them. Not about their lives or of their opinion about us.&quot; 
  India had been diplomatically voicing its concern about the worsening situation 
  to the government. The Sri Lankan government had been working up anti-Indian 
  remarks by the President. Significantly, the first public statement of concern 
  for the Tamils in Ceylon from Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, came between the 
  publication of Jayewardene's remarks in the Daily Telegraph and the commencement 
  of the racial violence six days later.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>We have seen that in the weeks 
  leading up to the 23rd of July 1983, the government had been building up for 
  a use of massive force against Tamils. Regulations had also been framed which 
  empowered state officials to break up refugee settlements of victims of the 
  1977 violence painstakingly built up in the North and East. Under cover of the 
  July 1983 violence, there was forced transport on a large scale of Indian Tamil 
  refugees from the North and East back to the hill country which they had fled 
  in fear six years previously. They were simply dumped in the hill country while 
  around them Tamils were again being killed and rendered refugees. July 1983 
  saw the publication of a report by Amnesty International detailing the large 
  scale practice of torture against detainees. This was dismissed by President 
  Jayewardene as communist inspired.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>The course of the violence 
  had such a planned character that the ambush of Sri Lankan soldiers rather than 
  being the cause would have represented simply a convenient starting point. Militant 
  activities in Jaffna had been on the increase. The army too had some successes. 
  On one occasion two militants were ambushed and killed. On 23 July the L.T.T.E. 
  killed 13 soldiers when the truck in which they were travelling hit a landmine 
  on Palaly road in Thirunelvely. A senior L.T.T.E. man, Sellakilli, who had turned 
  the tables on Inspector Bastianpillai was also killed. According to one source 
  there had been a mix up of signals and Sellakilli had stood up. The following 
  day the army went on a spree in Jaffna killing 41 people - some in their homes, 
  some while they were waiting for buses at Manipay, and so on. The violence in 
  Colombo started in the early hours of 25 July. 53 Tamil detainees at Welikade 
  prison were killed in two successive attacks by armed fellow prisoners on the 
  25th and 27th of July. There was no impartial inquiry into this incident. It 
  is believed that the prison massacre was planned at the highest levels and in 
  the circumstances it could hardly have been otherwise.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>The excerpts given below are 
  taken from &quot;<i>Sri Lanka: The Holocaust and After</i>,&quot; by L. Piyadasa, 
  Marram Books, London (1984). These describe the course of violence:</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:9.0pt;letter-spacing:-.1pt'>In 
  Kelaniya, Industries Minister Cyril Mathew's gangs were identified as the ones 
  at work. The General Secretary of the government &quot;union&quot; the Jathika 
  Sevaka Sangamaya (J.S.S.) was identified as the leader of gangs which wrought 
  destruction and death all over Colombo and especially in Wellawatte, where as 
  many as ten houses a street were destroyed. A particular U.N.P. municipal councillor 
  of the Dehiwela-Mount Lavinia Municipality led gangs in Mount Lavinia. In the 
  Pettah (the bazaar area, where 442 shops were destroyed and murders were committed) 
  the commander was the son of Aloysius Mudalali, the Prime Minister's right-hand 
  man. And so on. Thugs who worked regularly for the leaders of the U.N.P., the 
  Ministers of State and Party Headquarters, and in some cases uniformed military 
  personnel and police, were seen leading the attack. They used vehicles of the 
  Sri Lanka Transport Board (Minister in charge, M. H. Mohammed) and other government 
  departments and state corporations. Trucks of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation's 
  Oil Refinery came from many miles away bringing the men who destroyed so much 
  of Wellawatte. There is much other evidence of this sort. In view of the quasi-governmental 
  nature of the &quot;action,&quot; the killings that took place may have been 
  difficult for the eye-witnesses to resist ... But in the neighbourhoods, after 
  the initial shock, Sinhalese and Burghers organised themselves and kept off 
  the gangs who had been sent to burn and kill.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>We have talked to people who 
  were eye-witnesses of the killings - the beatings-to-death and burnings-alive 
  in cold blood of individual Tamils seized, with never a case of police opposition, 
  on the streets and in vehicles. Most people have read or heard the account, 
  which we are convinced is authentic, of the Norwegian tourist who saw twenty 
  people burnt alive in a minibus by one of these gangs. One of the most remarkable 
  exploits of the &quot;heroes&quot; was the massacre, that day, in Welikade Prison 
  (Sri Lanka's most important) of 35 people including some convicted men, and 
  most either on remand or arbitrarily detained by the military. All were Sri 
  Lankan Tamils. We are convinced that this massacre could not have been carried 
  out without government and National Security Council authorisation and preparation 
  at a level which would have guaranteed immunity from prosecution and public 
  investigation. The men and women responsible for the conspiracy to commit this 
  atrocity were never named, nor were those who organised and directed it. Fellow-prisoners 
  of the murdered persons who were set up to commit some of the killings, and 
  provided with weapons (and what else?), were collectively but not individually 
  identified, but no one was charged!</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>The pogrom continued less 
  intensely in Greater Colombo for three more days, in spite of the curfew. On 
  Tuesday, July 26th, some of the action squads were transported to Kandy, some 
  70 miles away, and that afternoon there was a similar sharp and quick action 
  there before the curfew was declared at 6 p.m. It then moved further up-country, 
  past towns like Matale (devastated) and Nawalapitiya towards Badulla and Nuwara 
  Eliya. Hindu temples had been added to the hit list. Army action had resulted 
  in over 60 per cent of Badulla's city centre being reduced to rubble. On the 
  27th, incredibly, the second massacre of Tamil political detainees and remand 
  prisoners was successfully carried out. This time 18 were killed. There was 
  more to come. For, as some of the Tamils began to trickle back to work towards 
  the end of the week, their fellow-countryman, J. R. Jayewardene, spoke publicly 
  for the first time on Thursday evening, justifying what had been done to the 
  Tamils in South and central Sri Lanka, and uttering not a word of sympathy. 
  On Friday, this provocative speech, and other actions, led to further arson 
  and many more killings.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>The second extract describes 
  the peculiar conduct of Mr. Gamini Dissanayake, M.P. for Nuwara Eliya and Minister 
  of Lands and Land Development. Nuwara Eliya erupted following his visit, after 
  the city had been brought under control by persons acting with foresight:</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:9.0pt;letter-spacing:-.1pt'>The 
  town was closely guarded by the army. All vehicles were checked. Bus conductors 
  had orders not to transport Tamils. Minister Gamini Dissanayake came from Colombo 
  to Nuwara Eliya to hold a meeting with party members. The day before, M.P. Herath 
  Ranasinghe had arrested precautiously (sic) some well-known rowdies. Soon after 
  the end of Gamini Dissanayake's party meeting they were released. These people 
  went out immediately, well-equipped with petrol, iron rods and other kinds of 
  weapons, and tried to attack two Tamil priests in town. They managed to escape. 
  Without having succeeded they moved on - another mob joined up with the first 
  one. They laid a ring of petrol around a Tamil shop which was then burnt. They 
  were supported in this by the army who supplied them with gallons of petrol. 
  During the day nearly all Tamil-owned shops were burnt. Mrs. Herath Ranasinghe 
  ordered the army to disperse the looters - but it was already too late. The 
  Member of Parliament was banished from town under a hail of insults. Tamil people 
  who walked the streets were beaten by soldiers. The fire brigade which stood 
  waiting was hindered by the army and the Sinhalese mob in doing its job... Shops 
  which had not been burnt by the mob were set fire to by the army. Around noon 
  Nuwara Eliya was like a sea of flames... (&quot;<i>Sri Lanka - 'Paradise' in 
  Ruins</i>,&quot; Sri Lanka Co-ordination Centre, Kassel, 1983).</span><span style='font-size:11.0pt;letter-spacing:-.1pt'></span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>Addressing a meeting of the 
  L.J.E.W.U. (Lanka Jathika Estate Workers Union), a union sponsored by Mr. Dissanayake 
  as a rival to Mr. Thondaman's C.W.C., shortly after the July 1983 violence; 
  Dissanayake said: &quot;If India invades this country, the Tamils will be killed 
  within 24 hours.&quot; There was much talk at that time about Indian troops 
  being sent to protect Tamils. Dissanayake was, in the best street thug tradition, 
  doing more than his share of Tamil baiting.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>With the march of modern Sinhalese 
  nationalism, Duttugemunu, a prince from the second century B.C. had been brought 
  out of the mists of time and elevated to the position of the archetypal Sinhalese 
  hero. The most celebrated of Duttugemunu's acts was to defeat in single combat, 
  Elara, the aging King of Anuradhapura for 40 years. Elara had in his youth led 
  an army into Ceylon from South India, and according to the chronicle Mahavamsa 
  which contains the incident, had been a just and popular ruler. Duttugemunu 
  had built a tomb for his dead foe and had decreed that all passers by should 
  treat it with respect. To call Elara a Tamil and Duttugemunu a Sinhalese is 
  to load modern ethnic consciousness with meanings it did not possess in ancient 
  times. Indeed even as late as the first half of the 19th century, it was natural 
  for members of the Kandyan upper class whom the British wished to apprehend, 
  to seek refuge in Jaffna without feeling in any way aliens there. An older generation 
  of the Kandyan upper class was quite happy with its children seeking spouses 
  of the right caste in Jaffna, rather than in the low-country. There are many 
  anecdotal stories which illustrate this. Once Mrs. Bandaranaike's brother, Senator 
  Barnes Ratwatte, was heard speaking to someone in fluent Tamil. When a Tamil 
  person expressed surprise, Mr. Ratwatte had replied lightly: &quot;The higher 
  you go up Kandyan society, the Tamil improves.&quot; This suggests a Ceylonese 
  society divided on caste lines rather than on linguistic lines. This is confirmed 
  by recent scholarship (See &quot;<i>Ethnicity and Social Change in Sri Lanka</i>&quot;, 
  published by the Social Scientists Association, 1979).</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>Sinhalese-Buddhist nationalism 
  as it is known today was spearheaded by the emergence of a low-country based 
  commercial class under the opportunities provided by British ruled Ceylon. Kumari 
  Jayewardene has pointed out that the anti-Indianism of this class had to do 
  with current business rivalries with Indian merchants who were also making it 
  good, rather than with anything in the hazy past. A leading role in the development 
  of this nationalism was played by the Karawe caste, descended from Tamil speaking 
  mercenaries who were brought from South India in service of local kings shortly 
  before the coming of the Portuguese in 1505. Modern Sinhalese nationalism thus 
  propagated a series of myths through the teaching of history in schools; whence 
  the obscure prince Duttugemunu came to be the achetypical anti-Indian and anti-Tamil 
  hero. History has no justification for this if one looks at the continual migration 
  of peoples from India and their co-mingling over the centuries.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>The latter part of the seventies 
  saw an incident made sillier by the involvement in it of two highly educated 
  ministers. A monument in Anuradhapura long known as Elara's tomb was proclaimed 
  as being the tomb of Duttugemunu. Claims to this effect in the last three decades 
  died down when it was found that the opposition from professional scholars was 
  too much. This time some remains from the tomb were sent to the Government Analyst, 
  to prove that the remains were those of Duttugemunu. How that was to be done 
  in the case of a person dead for over two millennia with no medical history, 
  one does not know. Two of the ministers who took a prominent interest in the 
  ceremonial fanfare were Gamini Dissanayake and Lalith Athulathmudali. Acquiring 
  for themselves the Duttugemunu image was important for their politics and their 
  personal vanity. This may go some way to explain their heroics. (For more on 
  the subject of the tomb, see &quot;<i>The Tomb of Elara</i>,&quot; by Dr. James 
  Rutnam.)</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>Such histrionics were almost 
  exclusively part of the gimmickry of the Right. The Sinhalese masses were increasingly 
  fed on such opium to alleviate their bourgeoning misery. Theatrical gestures 
  of this kind are likely to cut little ice today. Indian troops are within a 
  few miles of the tomb. As an Indian General put it: &quot;We are not here to 
  play marbles&quot;. Dissanayake was prominent amongst the protagonists of the 
  Accord which 'invited' in the Indian troops. Mr. Dissanayake commands a ministry 
  with a very large flow of money, next perhaps only to defence expenditure. He 
  is also tipped to be a possible successor to President Jayewardene. With such 
  interests at stake, it is understandable for Duttugemunus to turn Ettappan or 
  Pilime Talawe, who connived with the British conquest of Pandya and Kandy respectively, 
  thus betraying the trust of their Lords.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>The July 1983 race riots marked 
  an outbreak of irrational frenzy. The reasons given are many: widespread corruption 
  at the top accompanied by impoverishment below; the increasing resort to ecstatic 
  religion by the common people whose worldly horizons were hopelessly restricted, 
  thus making them more vulnerable to emotive suggestions; the failure of economic 
  life in rural areas swelling the ranks of a discontented urban proletariat; 
  frustration resulting from the violent break up of the 1980 strike and the deprivation 
  of the safety valve of general elections through an almost certainly rigged 
  referendum, etc. The government succeeded in directing all this frustration 
  at the Tamils through its propaganda, thus providing sacrificial victims for 
  a Bacchanalian orgy. One may compare this with the periodic pogroms against 
  Jews in Tsarist Russia.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>The collective Sinhalese hysteria 
  had the character of a religious ritual. The Cabinet which one way or the other 
  sanctioned it, seemed to share in the hysteria. Hardly a minister came out clean. 
  S. J. Tambiah (&quot;<i>Ethnic Fratricide in Sri Lanka,</i>&quot; Chicago University 
  Press, 1985) records the conduct of some key ministers thus:</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'>In the wake of the July 1983 violence, perhaps 
  out of a &quot;feeling of being crushed and pressured by a massive tide of collective 
  aggression&quot; by the Sinhalese, it took the President 24 hours to impose 
  a curfew on Colombo, and four days to say anything at all. Then referring to 
  the mobs as a &quot;mass movement by the generality of the Sinhalese people,&quot; 
  the President averred: &quot;The time has come to accede to the clamour and 
  national respect of the Sinhalese people.&quot; This tide of appeasement was 
  carried on by other ministers. On the same television programme, Mr. Athulathmudali, 
  who was later to become Minister of National Security, nearly wept with ponderous 
  histrionics over a sight he had never dreamed he would see - lines of Sinhalese 
  people waiting to buy food as the result of riots! He had not a word to say 
  in sympathy for frightened Tamils crowded in indescribable conditions in refugee 
  camps... neither the President, the Cabinet, nor even a single Sinhalese politician 
  visited them to commiserate even briefly, or to promise relief and rehabilitation... 
  The same President who admitted that some of his armed forces had participated 
  in the riots wagged his finger at India for its alleged expansionist and interfering 
  ambitions... Minister Cyril Mathew declared in Parliament on 4th August 1983: 
  &quot;If the Sinhala<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span> [1] </span></a><sup><span

style='font-size:9.0pt;letter-spacing:-.1pt'> are the majority race, why can't 
  they be the majority?&quot; Even Ronnie de Mel who later tried to distance himself 
  from the government's Tamil policy did not come out untarnished.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>Piyadase puts it thus: &quot;The 
  economic interests represented by Esmond Wickremasinghe, Cyril Mathew and Gamini 
  Dissanayake can be furthered only at considerable cost to the people of Sri 
  Lanka.&quot;</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>One thing was clear after 
  the riots. For the first time a government had connived in violence against 
  a section of its own people on such a large scale. Wild passions had been unleashed. 
  It was an invitation to all and sundry to fish in troubled waters. The country 
  was not going to be the same again. (For a detailed exposition of the subject, 
  see L. Piyadasa's &quot;<i>Sri Lanka: The Holocaust and After</i>,&quot; Marram 
  Books, London, 1984) <a href="#top">[Top]</a></p>
