<p align=center style='text-align:center;'><b><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;'>1987: THE BUBBLE BURSTS</span></b></p>
<p><b><span style='font-size:11.0pt;'>6.1Retreat to Jaffna</span></b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:9.0pt;letter-spacing:-.1pt'>The L.T.T.E. showed little interest 
  in negotiating on the basis of the December 19th proposals. With Prabhakaran's 
  arrival, the public felt that Kittu as Jaffna leader would in due course be 
  eclipsed.</span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>As the year commenced the Special Task Force (S.T.F.) made 
  rapid gains in the East forcing the L.T.T.E. out of several of its strongholds 
  and establishing new camps. Describing the terror of civilians, a member of 
  the Batticaloa citizens committee said:&quot;The S.T.F. was given a blank cheque 
  to kill, assault, torture and imprison civilians. This was used with terrifying 
  effect. Foreign correspondents were kept out.&quot;</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:9.0pt;letter-spacing:-.1pt'>In the North, outside Jaffna, all 
  areas populated by civilians were overrun by late February and several new camps 
  were established by the Sri Lankan army. The recently built up air power had 
  been used to good effect. India had apparently placed restrictions on the L.T.T.E. 
  acquiring an effective counter to the government's air power. It is noteworthy 
  that the Sri Lankan army's attempt nearly a year earlier, to establish control 
  over the Kilinochchi district had failed when all militant groups were active. 
  A worried L.T.T.E., withdrew most of its men from other areas and concentrated 
  them in Jaffna. Significantly, key L.T.T.E. leaders from other areas, including 
  Mahattaya from Vavuniya, and Radha from Mannar, made their appearance in Jaffna. 
  This meant that the threat to Jaffna was indeed taken seriously.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:9.0pt;letter-spacing:-.1pt'>This brings us to certain aspects 
  of the L.T.T.E.. From 1985 it had been a common feature of all militant groups 
  to attract a following by successfully bringing off sensational military operations. 
  The T.E.L.O. which was considered a marginal group rose to prominence after 
  its colourful attacks on the Chavakachcheri Police Station and on a troop train 
  at Murukandy in December 1984 and January 1985, respectively. What a particular 
  group stood for became, if anything, of marginal interest. As a corollary, the 
  people accepted the role of spectators and often admirers. This reciprocal development 
  went in the direction of the militant groups confining the people rigidly to 
  this role. Advice was seldom taken. The L.T.T.E. went a step further and confined 
  the people to the role of devotees. Those who sensed danger and wished to offer 
  their counsel were silenced with varying degrees of politeness. The reduction 
  of the people to devotees of the political religion of the L.T.T.E. was the 
  culmination of a process begun by the T.U.L.F. in the early 1970's. The F.P. 
  and later the T.U.L.F. had demanded allegiance to one party as embodying the 
  destiny of the Tamil nation. All others were branded as traitors of various 
  shades.</span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>Its own following which the T.U.L.F. could keep in tow with 
  rousing speeches, the L.T.T.E. now had to manipulate by deeds of valour which 
  testified to its virility. The religion of the L.T.T.E. also provided for its 
  devotees the emotional excitement of blood sacrifice. The sacrificial victims 
  were those chosen by chance and sometimes by choice, to die in operations.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText> It became a regular routine that when some 
  L.T.T.E. member died, wailing music would be broadcast over loud speakers. The 
  roads would be decorated with coconut and plantain trees. Loudspeaker vehicles 
  would go around announcing the deaths in melodramatic tones. Then crowds would 
  file past the coffins by the thousands. Such occasions were used to generate 
  hysterical emotions. This may explain Thileepan's death by fasting two months 
  after the Accord. The L.T.T.E. felt a need to prove that its members were still 
  willing to die and that it had not lost its grip.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>Unlike the higher religions 
  which tended towards equality of men and even living creatures, the L.T.T.E.'s 
  religion was hierarchical. The common people counted for little except as devotees. 
  Militants from other groups, whatever their contribution, were counted as criminals 
  or anti-social elements. Only L.T.T.E. members could make sacrifices, be counted 
  as martyrs, and become gods in a heavenly place reserved for them. Such a creed 
  was expressed in one of Thileepan's last statements.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>One should not under-rate 
  such a religion which has a resemblance to the official religion of the Third 
  Reich. The power of such a religion to captivate men's minds, make them forget 
  all norms of civilisation and morality and weld them together as a hysterical 
  and destructive force, is enormous. But most Tamil civilians were looking for 
  security. Little did they realise that what the L.T.T.E. was offering them was 
  permanent conflict, destruction and suicide, for accepting which they were not 
  going to be thanked. Events of the coming months were to make this abundantly 
  clear.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>Following the Sri 
  Lankan army's rapid advances in January 1987, the L.T.T.E. felt a pressing need 
  to hit back. On the 14th of February an ingenious attempt was made on the Navatkuli 
  army camp. The Andreisz Company which was located next to the Navatkuli camp 
  used to supply drinking water to the Sri Lankan army. The L.T.T.E. took over 
  the company's water bowser and placed charges in its tank, which would explode 
  when the water dropped to a certain level. According to reports the water tank 
  by some freak developed a leak. The bowser was taken into a lane at Kaithady. 
  According to one report a welder was brought to repair the leak. By some accident 
  the bowser exploded. Amongst the ten L.T.T.E. persons killed were three senior 
  leaders, Kugan, Curdles and Vasu. The presence of Kugan who was second in command 
  to Prabhakaran and close to him, suggests that Prabhakaran was in direct command 
  of the operation. Forty civilians were reportedly killed. The operation had 
  to be abandoned. The L.T.T.E. announced the deaths through loud speakers and 
  its notice boards. A disturbing aspect of this announcement was that the civilian 
  deaths were not mentioned.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>Even the newspapers 
  gave very little publicity to the civilian deaths. This set the precedent for 
  developments to come. Not surprisingly it may be noted that both the Sri Lankan 
  government and the L.T.T.E. were superstitious. The digits in dates normally 
  chosen by the L.T.T.E. for major operations would add up to five, whereas for 
  the government it would add up to eight. People would normally expect L.T.T.E.'s 
  initiatives on the 5th, 14th and 23rd of a month and government initiatives 
  on the 8th, 17th or 26th of a month.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>The government resumed 
  aerial bombing of Jaffna on the 7th of March. A massive barrage of shelling 
  from Jaffna Fort killed 17 civilians at Windsor Theatre junction and injured 
  50. A shell also fell on the hospital for the first time.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>In the early hours 
  of the morning on Monday, 30 March, shells again fell on the Jaffna hospital. 
  Eight patients were killed in Ward 19/20. Two nurses and an attendant were injured. 
  It may be noted that the ward affected was a medical ward having elderly heart 
  patients. It should also be noted here that this shelling was strongly condemned 
  by India. When the National Security Minister suggested that the shell was fired 
  by the L.T.T.E., noting the fact that the shells came from the direction of 
  the Fort, the Indian ambassador J. N. Dixit is said to have remarked sarcastically 
  that the L.T.T.E. has a special shell which goes forward and then turns back.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>On the night of 30 
  March, a bomb was thrown at the L.T.T.E.'s Jaffna leader Mr. Kittu, while he 
  was visiting a friend living on 2nd Cross Street, Jaffna. One of his body guards, 
  a youth from Mannar, was killed. Kittu himself was admitted to the hospital 
  and had one of his legs amputated. The news came out that some prisoners had 
  died on the evening of the following day at the L.T.T.E.'s Brown Road camp. 
  The B.B.C. broadcast a news item which claimed shortly afterwards that a large 
  number of prisoners held by the L.T.T.E. had been killed, following the attempt 
  on Kittu. Some sources put the number at 70. In an atmosphere of mounting rumours, 
  the L.T.T.E. issued a press statement on the 6th of April claiming that prisoners 
  grabbed some weapons and tried to escape and that in the ensuing battle, two 
  L.T.T.E. guards and 18 prisoners were killed. A member of the E.P.R.L.F. who 
  escaped during the incident and later went to Batticaloa submitted an affidavit 
  to the following effect: &quot;Several of us prisoners were kept in a room at 
  the L.T.T.E.'s Brown Road camp. In the evening Aruna (L.T.T.E.'s former Batticaloa 
  leader) burst into the room and opened fire at us with an automatic weapon. 
  Three of us managed to escape through another door and get away. Eighteen were 
  killed during that incident.&quot;</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>Aruna is known to 
  have been close to Kittu. In publishing the L.T.T.E.'s statement on the incident, 
  the Jaffna daily Murasoli, of 6 April, 1987 announced in banner headlines: &quot;18 
  Criminals killed.&quot; This represented new levels of opportunism in journalism. 
  The L.T.T.E. statement had not claimed that the dead were criminals. The L.T.T.E. 
  is believed to have killed several other E.P.R.L.F. members in other camps at 
  the same time. One whose death was widely talked about at that time was E.P.R.L.F.'s 
  Dr. Benjamin, who had worked with refugees. The Saturday Review after consulting 
  a senior member of the L.T.T.E. reported that in all about 50 prisoners were 
  killed. The identities and affiliations of Kittu's would-be-assassins were never 
  revealed.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>On 2 April, the attack 
  by the L.T.T.E. on a mini-camp at Valvettithurai was repulsed with the L.T.T.E. 
  suffering five dead. An ambulance carrying five persons injured by shelling 
  from Pt. Pedro hospital to Jaffna was shelled by helicopter at Vallai-veli, 
  killing the patients and the ambulance driver.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>A senior figure in 
  Jaffna put across to Minister Thondaman the idea of a cease-fire over the traditional 
  Sinhalese-Tamil new year, to be used to set the scene for negotiations in order 
  to restore peace. Mr. Thondaman asked the cabinet for a fortnight's cease fire. 
  The cabinet agreed to a unilateral cease fire of nine days from 11th - 19th 
  April. This was rejected by V. Prabhakaran who stated that he would consider 
  a cease fire after the 20th of April. It was to be expected that such a response 
  from the L.T.T.E. would have been seen by the outside world as puerile diplomacy 
  bordering on intransigence. Though the senior figure in Jaffna felt that the 
  government's announcement of the cease fire was sincerely intended, Prabhakaran's 
  stand had widespread sympathy from a people who had come to believe that all 
  the blame for the situation lay with the government. The aerial bombing and 
  shelling of the civilian population had made the people deeply distrustful of 
  the government. Reports of government breaches of the cease fire started appearing 
  in the Jaffna press. Given the situation, whenever government forces shelled, 
  it became difficult to determine who provoked and who retaliated.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>On 16 April 1987, 
  150 Sinhalese, many of them civilians returning to Trincomalee after new year 
  festivities at Anuradhapura, were off-loaded from their buses and massacred 
  at Kituluttuwa. The L.T.T.E. was widely blamed and the government claimed that 
  the massacre was led by L.T.T.E.'s Pulendran. Shortly afterwards, on 21 April, 
  a car bomb exploded at the Pettah bus stand in Colombo, killing over 100 civilians. 
  The attack was widely attributed to a Tamil militant group, believed to be either 
  the E.R.O.S. or the L.T.T.E.. International opinion drifted away from sympathy 
  for Tamils, towards approving a Sri Lankan government crack down on Tamil militants.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>In the early hours 
  of 22nd April, an L.T.T.E. party under Radha's command attacked the jetty at 
  K.K.S. where cement bags from Lanka Cement Ltd. (L.C.L.) were being loaded into 
  a waiting ship. This is again an example of the L.T.T.E.'s daring and capacity 
  to improvise in order to stage sensational suicidal attacks. These attacks were 
  usually accompanied by a heavy civilian toll and made the government more brutal 
  and intransigent. It put the civilian population in further jeopardy while providing 
  grist for the L.T.T.E. to further its religious appeal. The security precautions 
  at the entrance to the jetty were elaborate. Lorries loaded with cement went 
  North from the L.C.L. plant and had to queue up as they reached the K.K.S. - 
  Keerimalai Road before crossing into the premises of the harbour which were 
  under Sri Lankan army control. As the lorry that had just unloaded came out, 
  the first lorry in the waiting queue crossed the road into the harbour premises. 
  During the crossing a security officer from L.C.L. walked some distance with 
  the lorry. The L.T.T.E.'s plan was a high risk, ingenious strategy and hence 
  unexpected by the army. According to sources within the L.T.T.E., its members 
  compete with each other to volunteer for such suicidal missions.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>L.T.T.E. men were 
  hidden in a lorry with a wall of cement bags to disguise it as one going to 
  unload. The lorry was parked in a lane towards the land side, a few yards from 
  the crossing point, but hidden from the army. Calculating that the concentration 
  of the army sentries will be at a low ebb in the early hours of the morning, 
  as a lorry which had finished unloading came out of the harbour, the L.T.T.E. 
  lorry made a dash and got in front of the one which was to enter. This went 
  unnoticed by the army sentries who were poised on the water tank. The L.C.L. 
  security guard was too shocked to react and followed on foot the L.T.T.E. lorry 
  which had been allowed inside.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>Once in, the L.T.T.E. 
  men opened fire killing 18 soldiers, and were soon out again. The army was angry. 
  They got hold of five L.C.L. security guards and killed them. One of those killed 
  was Sergeant Mylvaganam, who had earlier been a police sergeant. Another L.C.L. 
  foreman was dragged out of the bathroom and shot. At the time of the attack 
  70 labourers were employed in loading cement bags at the jetty. Fortunately 
  for them, the Sinhalese ship's captain, fearing reprisals against them, took 
  them aboard and put out to sea. These workers were put ashore several hours 
  later after the captain obtained the assurance that the workers would not be 
  molested. The Sri Lankan government overplayed its propaganda card when it wrapped 
  bullet bands around the bodies of the L.C.L. security officers killed and displayed 
  them on the state television Rupavahini as terrorists killed. Any intelligent 
  viewer would have found the body of 55-year-old Sergeant Mylvaganam with greying 
  hair, appearing as that of a youthful terrorist, too much to swallow. A more 
  intelligent way of lying would have been to avoid the extras and blame the killing 
  of Tamil security officers on the L.T.T.E.. This again indicates how the government 
  treated the whole question as a military problem and was not interested in making 
  overtures to Tamil opinion. This worked to the L.T.T.E.'s benefit.. If the government 
  troops had been disciplined to avoid reprisals against civilians, it could have 
  exposed the futility of the L.T.T.E.'s action. But the government had very different 
  ideas. The next six weeks were to see an unleashing of random impersonal terror 
  against Tamil civilians.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>The people of K.K.S. 
  and the workers at the two cement plants had been dismayed by the L.T.T.E.'s 
  action. The L.T.T.E. had given the workers at the cement plants an assurance 
  that it would not interfere with their work. Working relations between the army 
  and the cement plants had been fairly good. The citizens' committees in the 
  area had worked out an unwritten agreement between the L.T.T.E. and the army, 
  allowing the latter free use of the K.K.S. - Palaly Road. This enabled the civilians 
  to stay on in that area. Now all this came to an end. With an increasing number 
  of landmine attacks by the L.T.T.E., the army took to shooting at civilians. 
  Several civilians were shot dead, including Dr. Viswaranjan who was returning 
  home to K.K.S. on 25 April, after working at the Jaffna hospital. This led to 
  the total exodus of civilians from K.K.S., Myliddy and Maviddapuram. On the 
  meaningless suffering of all these people, aided by the Sri Lankan government's 
  intransigent brutality, was built the expanding edifice of the L.T.T.E. religion. 
  The random shelling and aerial bombing of the Tamil civilian population commenced 
  on 22 April. Emotional support for the L.T.T.E. increased. People asked what 
  India was doing. A senior Indian official told a newspaper editor, that after 
  the Pettah bomb blast and the Kituluttuwa massacre, India had lost the moral 
  right to protest. The destructive policies of the L.T.T.E. and the Sri Lankan 
  government received mutual sustenance from each other.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>The people around 
  K.K.S. had for a year tried a policy of live and let live with both the L.T.T.E. 
  and the Sri Lankan army. Through its supporters within the cement plants the 
  L.T.T.E. had enjoyed some privileges there. A workshop engineer had resigned 
  and gone abroad in January 1987 after an L.T.T.E. party gave him their &quot;first 
  warning.&quot; The engineer's professional pride did not allow him to give in 
  to certain demands. He had also been alarmed by the readiness with which people 
  played with the safety of their colleagues for the sake of power and influence. 
  The policy of live and let live without a principled stand was doomed to failure. 
  The cement plants were closed on 22 April.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>Another incident which 
  influenced the local mind was the landmine attack by the L.T.T.E. on an army 
  patrol on 25 March 1987. Subsequently the severed foot of a Sri Lankan soldier 
  with a boot on it was exhibited successively at the Maviddapuram temple and 
  Tellipallai junction. For its part the Sri Lankan army shelled these two places 
  on successive nights. On the first night a temple priest lost his leg. At Tellipallai 
  junction, Mr. Venugopal was killed. On the 31 March, the L.T.T.E.'s Jaffna leader 
  Mr. Kittu lost a leg in a grenade attack. Many of the Hindu folk at Maviddapuram, 
  steeped in a belief in karma, formed their own conclusions. Nevertheless, the 
  exhibition of gore had attracted sizeable crowds. This followed the exhibition 
  of the dead bodies of nine Sri Lankan soldiers at Kandasamy Kovil four months 
  before. There was taking place a transformation of sensibilities. Many Hindus 
  were disgusted, but silent.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>The Sri Lankan government 
  commenced random shelling of the civilian population in Jaffna, together with 
  aerial bombing on 22 April. One could hear shells falling in quick succession 
  in widely separated places, usually around 6:30 a.m. and 6:30 p.m. Most would 
  quickly take their families into the house or into a trench if they had one, 
  and say their prayers. The aerial bombing was often off the mark. The Sri Lankan 
  air force tried four times to bomb an L.T.T.E. camp in Pt. Pedro situated in 
  the crowded market area, and finally finished the job with a bulldozer a month 
  later, after taking over Vadamaratchi at the end of May. About a hundred civilians 
  were killed up to 26 May as a result of the bombing and shelling.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>On the 1st of May, 
  the L.T.T.E. defied the government ban on May day processions countrywide, and 
  organised a massive rally commencing at Urumpirai junction, and ending with 
  a public meeting at Kandasamy Kovil. Vans, buses and lorries were commandeered 
  and were used to ferry people from distant places. L.T.T.E. cadres knocked on 
  doors and asked people to come. Some flatly refused. Others went with varying 
  combinations of consent and fear. The majority who went, did so willingly or 
  out of curiosity.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>At the meeting, the 
  L.T.T.E.'s rising star and Kugan's brother, Yogi, gave a rousing speech. It 
  was a frank statement of what the L.T.T.E. was offering its subjects. Yogi said: 
  &quot;Even if 35 lakhs<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"
title=""><span> [1] </span></a><sup><span
style='font-size:8.5pt;letter-spacing:-.1pt'>1</span></sup><span
style='font-size:9.0pt;letter-spacing:-.1pt'> should die, we will not be deterred 
  from our goal of Tamil Eelam.&quot; He went on to indicate that a small fraction 
  of the present population of Tamils is enough to people the state of Tamil Eelam. 
  Few were alarmed by such frankness. The Tamil man was far from being suicidal, 
  although the L.T.T.E.'s critics had come to term its brand of politics, cyanide 
  or suicide politics. The Tamil man very much loved material security. (Curiously, 
  the L.T.T.E. again and again stressed the need to safeguard territory. There 
  was no corresponding stress on safeguarding life.) The fact that nearly every 
  household in Jaffna had constructed an air raid shelter at an average cost of 
  Rs. 1000/- showed that they were unlikely candidates for suicide. For sometime, 
  disenchantment with the manner of the L.T.T.E.'s campaign and its indifference 
  to the fate of civilians had been expressed by affected people from Mannar, 
  the Eastern Province and parts of Jaffna. These had fallen on deaf ears amongst 
  articulate folk in suburban Jaffna. For many, the manner in which the L.T.T.E. 
  had ruled Jaffna was acceptable. There were disappearances -- a minor problem. 
  But people could make money unmolested. Travel agents, employment agencies, 
  those who ran coach services to Colombo, and contractors continued to make their 
  money. The coach operators and the L.T.T.E. found it mutually advantageous to 
  cut train services to Colombo. (Coach fares came down from Rs. 200/- to Rs. 
  65/- when train services resumed after the Accord. The Sri Lankan army too had 
  good relations with the operators.) But now was approaching a time when all 
  this might have to change and misery was going to be the common lot. When the 
  L.T.T.E. started proceeding alone in May 1986, it had offered the people of 
  Jaffna, &quot;order within and security from attacks by the Sri Lankan forces.&quot; 
  This worked well for a while, but had crumbled with time. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>The Sri Lankan army 
  had been tightening its noose by the establishment of new camps at Vasavilan, 
  Kattuvan and Mandaitivu over the months. The Sri Lankan strategy was simple. 
  It would create diversions from various points, such as Jaffna, Pt. Pedro, Kayts, 
  V.V.T., Elephant Pass and Palaly. One of these would be the real column that 
  would advance under air cover and establish a new camp. Even in the latter half 
  of 1986, support from the E.P.R.L.F., E.R.O.S., P.L.O.T.E. and T.E.A. had been 
  crucial in countering the Sri Lankan advance, though the L.T.T.E. hated to admit 
  it. The counter-strategy developed by the militant groups was to have sentries 
  posted with walkie-talkies. When an advance was sighted, the main body of fighting 
  men, who would be mobile in pickups and mini-vans, would be summoned. This was 
  effective up to a point. But in 1987, the L.T.T.E. was clearly over-stretched. 
  When the Sri Lankan army advanced to Kattuvan on 28 February with just one covering 
  helicopter, hardly any resistance was offered. According to a resident of that 
  area, the sentry had radioed Kittu for reinforcements. He was aghast when Kittu 
  simply ordered him to chase the army back.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>On an earlier occasion, 
  the army had attacked Kattuvan by land and air, causing the L.T.T.E. sentry 
  to flee. The army then withdrew. In the evening Kittu arrived on the scene in 
  his car. He left his men and walked alone into the dusk. The short and balding 
  figure sat down by himself to reflect, his brow furrowed. He had dispatched 
  tens of C.I.A., Mossad and C.I.D. agents in his time, without giving it any 
  more thought than he would in deciding to have a cup of tea. Here was the man, 
  who during the Vijitharan affair kept the University dons awestruck, while he 
  poured out his contradictions. Their silence was as if to say, &quot;Yes, General.&quot; 
  The highest in Jaffna had waited on him. He had played with the lives of others 
  and had gambled with his own. Mendis, his own friend and Jaffna leader of the 
  P.L.O.T.E., had died in his custody. Friendship did not stand in the way of 
  such things. Amongst his men, there were those who resented his flamboyance. 
  But in battle, they trusted his leadership as few others' was trusted. We may 
  never know what passed through his mind. For the first time, perhaps, he was 
  a worried man. Did he have a premonition that his rising star would soon have 
  its setting?</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>Perhaps, the development 
  of the L.T.T.E. leadership is related to something deeply ingrained in the human 
  psyche appearing in the evolution myths of ancient lore. Many of the L.T.T.E. 
  leaders had lived like the ancient gods. Like Wotan in Niebelung's Ring and 
  Keat's Hyperion, gods who reach their limits of action must wish for self annihilation. 
  This is probably just a fancy that may explain one aspect of their development. 
  Motives are complex things and the L.T.T.E. leadership was moving in several 
  directions at the same time. Many of its leaders, Mahattaya, Kittu and Kumarappa, 
  were either married or were on the verge of it. Their leader Prabhakaran was 
  the father of two. The leadership had also demonstrated on several occasions 
  that it was interested in an arrangement where it would have settled power. 
  In late 1986 Kittu had made overtures to leading personalities and the media 
  in the South. There had been a good deal of comings and goings and much secret 
  talk. After the Accord of July 1987 much of the L.T.T.E.'s performance had been 
  a bid for power. The agreement reached with India during secret negotiations 
  at the the time of the fast, talked almost exclusively of power. In fact, they 
  wanted exclusive power, and to this end, they pushed their gambler's luck to 
  the brink. But the five demands put forward during Thileepan's fast to death, 
  of September 1987 had nothing about demands for power. When the L.T.T.E. wanted 
  something, it was prepared to play with the lives of its own men and with those 
  of civilians. The impasse resulting from the suicide in custody of 12 L.T.T.E. 
  members on 5 October 1987 and the subsequent massacre of Sinhalese, was part 
  of a pattern. By provoking a crisis the L.T.T.E. seemed to hope for a decisive 
  outcome, with perhaps help from Tamil Nadu. Their message seemed to say: &quot;Accept 
  our terms, for if you try anything else, we can sour things for you.&quot; </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>When India took on 
  the L.T.T.E., Prabhakaran said in a message: &quot;We have been forced into 
  fighting to protect ourselves. India must assume full responsibility for harm 
  resulting to the people.&quot; This was indeed, a most queer stand for someone 
  who claimed leadership and on whom it fell to protect the people. The war dragged 
  on. After the worst killing was over, the L.T.T.E.'s deputy leader Mahattaya, 
  in a letter to the Indian authorities, sued for an end to the fighting. A key 
  demand was a return to the <i>status quo</i> of 28 September which offered 7 
  out of 12 places on the interim council for the L.T.T.E.. Behind all the gore 
  and the Homeric drama, there was a bid for something tangible -- namely power. 
  There were the usual somersaults of traditional politics. For this reason it 
  will be wrong to romanticise the L.T.T.E.. Every human being is ridiculous most 
  of the time. Lord Byron, the most romanticised poet, confesses this frankly 
  in his work Don Juan.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>At the same time, 
  the leaders of the L.T.T.E. were proud men. They were proud of what they had 
  achieved and did not like being trifled with. India recognised this up to a 
  point. The Tigers were prepared to risk all they had in pursuit of a goal, in 
  addition to risking everyone else. The religious element in the L.T.T.E. has 
  already been mentioned. They also invoked other gods. Kittu was a pious Hindu, 
  who was also given to lighting candles at Christian shrines. The element of 
  calculation increased, the higher one went up the hierarchy. At the bottom, 
  there was an unquestioning religious zeal facilitated by the impressionable 
  boyishness of the new recruits.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>In May 1986, the L.T.T.E.'s 
  admirers in Jaffna viewed them as a military force which offered them physical 
  and material security. Between January and May 1987, a series of military reverses 
  ensured that this offer was no longer good. The L.T.T.E. had compensated for 
  this by substituting a religious appeal. When Yogi announced on 1 May 1987 that 
  even if 35 lakhs die, they would stay their course until Eelam is achieved, 
  people took it as the metaphorical expression of a religious sentiment. This 
  was after all common enough in these parts. Politicians in the South had sworn 
  to fight India down to the last drop of their blood. Even those members of the 
  public who were the L.T.T.E.'s most ardent supporters did not relish the thought 
  of departing this world. Yet they applauded. That the prospect of mass suicide 
  was being seriously held out by the L.T.T.E. did not really sink in. The L.T.T.E.'s 
  saying one thing and the public hoping for and understanding something else, 
  was to have several more repetitions. No one looking back can complain that 
  the L.T.T.E. had not made itself clear. The May day rally was held in the precincts 
  of the Nallur Kanthasamy temple. The choice of venue itself was a sign of things 
  to come. A massive crowd, numbering several tens of thousands had been brought 
  to Kanthasamy Kovil in defiance of a government ban. The possibility of a shell 
  attack from the Fort or firing from a helicopter was very real. Had this happened 
  the scene of disaster would have made good propaganda. The fortunate fact that 
  sanity prevailed and such an attack did not take place was again publicised 
  as a victory for the L.T.T.E.. It had successfully defied a ban which was observed 
  in the rest of the country. Either way the L.T.T.E. would have won. Yogi's words 
  literally meant that the human cost was immaterial. Civilian casualties were 
  used for propaganda abroad. But inside, L.T.T.E. casualties were announced with 
  religious fanfare, while civilian casualties received scant attention.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><b>6.2 The Navaratne episode</b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:9.0pt;letter-spacing:-.1pt'>It was now clear to many that the 
  Sri Lankan government was preparing to launch an offensive to recapture the 
  entire peninsula. Few doubted that they would succeed. The prospect of the entire 
  Jaffna peninsula being turned into a refugee camp, like the Eastern Province, 
  was very real. Several persons felt that a group of leading citizens should 
  talk to the L.T.T.E., with a view to persuading them of at least talking to 
  the government on the basis of the December 19th proposals. There were at this 
  time several channels of communication between the government and the L.T.T.E.. 
  One of these was the editor of the Saturday Review, Mr. Gamini Navaratne. He 
  had been the editor of the English Weekly published from Jaffna during the crucial 
  period which followed the 1983 riots. Being Sinhalese, his role was a delicate 
  one in which he was often misunderstood. Having been a lobby correspondent he 
  knew the senior parliamentarians well. He had the ability and guts, to push 
  his luck to the edge in publishing news of human rights violations by the government. 
  Unlike editors in the West, Mr. Navaratne was aware that restrictions were placed 
  on journalism by the contending parties to the conflict, all of whom had much 
  to hide. He was keen that the truth should somehow be brought out, and in this 
  his performance was well above the standards in this country. While being critical 
  of Jayewardene's handling of the ethnic crisis, Mr. Navaratne did have an affectionate 
  regard for him. He did look upon certain of the militant leaders with a paternal 
  affection. Among them were Kittu and Raheem of the L.T.T.E., the E.R.O.S. leader, 
  Balakumar, and the late Dr. Benjamin of the E.P.R.L.F.. He often expressed the 
  feeling that the boys had done a great job in standing up to the Sri Lankan 
  forces, and yet they were just boys who needed help in the form of mature counsel. 
  The December 19th proposals, he felt, were a reasonable basis for negotiations, 
  and that unless a settlement was reached fast, Jaffna would collapse under the 
  strain. No doubt, events proved him right. He was forthright in expressing these 
  views, which were accepted by a section of the public. But another uncharitable 
  section of the public were deeply suspicious of him. In the highest circles 
  in Jaffna he was accused of being an agent of one kind or the other including 
  being J. R.'s agent. Now that Kittu and Raheem were under a cloud the leadership 
  of the L.T.T.E. was suspicious of him. Mr. Navaratne's recent attempts to talk 
  to the L.T.T.E., regarding the December 19th proposals had met with rebuffs. 
  Where others had taken the hint, Navaratne was not so easily put off.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>On 11 May, a group 
  of persons met independently at the university to discuss an approach to the 
  L.T.T.E. with a view to averting the looming prospect. Navaratne heard of this 
  meeting and arrived at the university. He spent a few minutes giving his views 
  on the subject and went away after wishing them luck. It was on this occasion 
  that the full extent of the L.T.T.E.'s spy network at the University was revealed. 
  A highly fanciful rumour was sent out by some senior persons to the effect that 
  Mr. Navaratne was at the University to organise a petition against the L.T.T.E., 
  that was to be presented at the S.A.A.R.C. Editors' Conference. It was a shocking 
  revelation that both amongst the staff and students, colleagues were spying 
  on colleagues, with little thought of the possibility that they might put their 
  colleagues in grave danger. Navaratne was followed and placed under arrest by 
  a medical student. The manner of his arrest was disrespectful and gave no consideration 
  to his invaluable services. After an investigation led by Mahattaya himself, 
  the L.T.T.E. was convinced that they had been fed with bad information, by some 
  of their so-called senior advisors. Mr. Navaratne was released four days later. 
  It was a sign of the wretched state of Jaffna that in the face of disaster, 
  some of its elites could do no better than to cast speculative aspersions on 
  a man who, after all, believed that he was doing something for the people. Several 
  months later, after the L.T.T.E. had lost its position of control in the wake 
  of the Indian offensive, some in the L.T.T.E. recognised the value of independent 
  journalism. A high ranker in the L.T.T.E. told a senior citizen that they would 
  like Mr. Navaratne to continue his editorial work in Jaffna. The senior citizen 
  replied: &quot;Had Mr. Navaratne been here on the night of 5th October, you 
  would have made a bonfire of him in the Jaffna Hindu College grounds.&quot; 
  The 5th of October was the night when the L.T.T.E. launched a manhunt against 
  Sinhalese residents in Jaffna.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><b>6.3 The closing of Jaffna Hospital</b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:9.0pt;letter-spacing:-.1pt'>Another episode pertaining to this 
  period was the government's attempt to close down Jaffna hospital. A letter 
  from the Ministry of teaching hospitals dated 27 April reached the hands of 
  the Medical Superintendent, Jaffna, on 3 May. This letter contained an order 
  for him to close the Jaffna hospital by the 8th of May. This was a sign that 
  the government was getting ready for an offensive. The government had received 
  bad publicity on account of shells falling on Jaffna hospital and the casualties 
  resulting from it. Many of the doctors admitted that given the army's order 
  to fire back when fired upon, it was inevitable that even if the army commanders 
  were careful, shells fired from the Jaffna Fort would fall on Jaffna hospital. 
  The army had the unenviable task of maintaining a mere presence in Jaffna. For 
  the rest, the soldiers were cooped up and vulnerable to missiles fired from 
  outside. In January 1986, the army was ordered to retaliate with cannon, up 
  to a radius of 1 kilometre from the Jaffna fort. The commercial hub of Jaffna 
  and the hospital fell within this distance. This marked an escalation of the 
  conflict in terms of civilian cost. By the middle of 1986, shells had been aimed 
  at targets 3 miles from the Fort. One aimed apparently at an L.T.T.E. camp killed 
  the bridegroom and the bride's father when it exploded amidst a wedding party. 
  As time went by the shelling acquired a more indiscriminate character. Snipers 
  too were brought in later. Several ordinary citizens getting about Bankshall 
  Street and K.K.S. Road fell victim to snipers. One army officer, regarded as 
  a considerate man, told a Tamil friend that they would sometimes watch from 
  the fort in the night in a state of fear. When they sometimes observed fire 
  directed at the Fort, it could easily appear to come from the hospital. At the 
  same time the staff at the hospital had obtained from the militants a guarantee 
  that their premises would not be used to fire at the army and were certain that 
  the guarantee had been honoured. But in such a volatile environment, the danger 
  to the hospital was there. A rational way out of it would have been a truce 
  in the Fort area. But when lethal means are available, rationality tends to 
  go out of the window. Cannon came in handy when the army was in a bad temper 
  and wished to take it out on the civilians.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>The press in Jaffna 
  mentioned only the shelling by the army. But many journalists would admit that 
  there was also constant provocation by firing things into the Fort. If the L.T.T.E.'s 
  conduct during the hospital crisis of May 1987 did anything at all, it added 
  weight to the suspicion that its attitude towards civilians was basically cynical.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>Cynicism was widespread 
  in this conflict and was in the long run destructive to all who employed it. 
  If a landmine went off in a remote village, the army would hit the civilians 
  hard in the hope that it would destroy the militants' support base. One way 
  or the other the militants would welcome the government action as bringing in 
  additional support for their cause. It was an extension of July 1983. A case 
  of how this cynicism deepened enmity between groups was that of a young member 
  of the E.P.R.L.F. from Batticaloa. He was travelling along Hospital Road, when 
  he got a bullet in the back. This would normally have been associated with a 
  sniper in the Fort. This boy later said in hospital, that he had looked back 
  as he lost consciousness and fell down. He had only seen L.T.T.E. sentries. 
  He claimed that the bullet extracted from his body was not from a sniper rifle 
  but was fired from an M-16. Rightly or wrongly he had formed his conclusions 
  and was extremely bitter.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>The order to close 
  Jaffna hospital gave rise to widespread shock and panic. This came at the height 
  of indiscriminate shelling resulting in casualties, who but for Jaffna hospital 
  would have faced death. The Tellipallai and Pt. Pedro hospitals too had been 
  hit by shells, and after the shelling of an ambulance from Pt. Pedro on 4 April, 
  the transport of patients became a precarious activity. The short supply of 
  petrol added to the complications. By 6 May, Jaffna had virtually become a ghost 
  town. Shops shifted their goods and residents fled their homes. This too was 
  a tricky affair. Those lucky enough to rent a house in the interior had to move 
  again on discovering that the house had once been a militant camp. Such places 
  were considered fair game for Sri Lankan bombers. The hospital started discharging 
  most of its patients from Monday the 4th of May. It is a tribute to the grit 
  of the common man that most services kept functioning during this fearsome period. 
  The banks remained open for a few hours in the mornings. Life went on against 
  a background of shell blasts and firing from L.T.T.E. sentries.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>Mrs. Sivapakiam Nadarajah, 
  a long term resident in front of Jaffna hospital, was on 5 May, packing her 
  things to send them away to Chavakachcheri. One then witnessed the amazing spectacle 
  of a milkman, who calmly dismounted from his bicycle and rang his bell for someone 
  to fetch the milk. He then lazily looked up at the sky and at the twittering 
  birds on the trees. His whistling could be heard between shell blasts. Three 
  shells fell only 90 minutes later on a building opposite the new Out-Patients' 
  Department (O.P.D.) in the hospital, about 40 yards to the West of Commercial 
  bank. This demonstrated the kind of risk involved. That the thought of death 
  was writ large on people's minds was evident. Asked how he came to terms with 
  coming to work given the risk involved; Mr. Arul Gnanaseelan, an employee of 
  the Commercial Bank said: &quot;I trust in God and come to work. If He has a 
  purpose in keeping me alive, I will live. If it is time for me to go, it is 
  in His hands.&quot; Mr. Mohanachandran, another milkman, said, covering his 
  anxiety with a smile, that distributing milk had become a cumbersome business. 
  When he went to the homes of some of his customers, he had to ring his bell 
  for a long time and wait on the road listening to the music of the shells. This 
  was because many of his customers were inside trenches. During a slight pause, 
  the customer would cautiously emerge, make a dash for the gate, collect his 
  milk in a pan and then beat an unceremonious retreat. He added: &quot;I too 
  spend the nights in a trench with my family in Kopay. One must understand the 
  feelings of those soldiers too. They must be feeling pretty rotten after the 
  Pettah bomb blast and the Kitul-uttuwa massacre.&quot; The people of Jaffna 
  can be proud, that amongst the humble ranks of its milkmen, can be found the 
  right material for the world's most intrepid war correspondents.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>In the meantime, representatives 
  from amongst the hospital authorities and the G.M.O.A. (Government Medical Officers 
  Association) went to Colombo to make representations concerning the case for 
  Jaffna hospital. Even before the closure threat, the region's largest hospital 
  with 1150 beds, was down to having 550 patients. The main body of the G.M.O.A. 
  in Colombo was sympathetic to the need to keep Jaffna hospital open. So was 
  the Ministry for Teaching Hospitals, which had even earlier argued against the 
  closure. In consequence of their discussions with the L.T.T.E., the doctors 
  from Jaffna felt that the L.T.T.E. would go along with any reasonable arrangement 
  to keep the hospital open. The L.T.T.E. did have sound military reasons for 
  keeping the hospital open. If the hospital was to be closed, the town would 
  be abandoned. For, this would remove all restrictions placed on Sri Lankan military 
  activity. The L.T.T.E. would thus lose the civilian cover which made it possible 
  for it to maintain a presence around Jaffna Fort. When the news of the closure 
  order came, the L.T.T.E. backed a demonstration in which a large number of medical 
  students took part. The demonstrators demanded that the hospital staff should 
  defy the closure order and stay put. Some suggested that if the hospital was 
  shelled and some doctors got killed, it would so much the more embarrass the 
  Sri Lankan authorities. The doctors pointed out that things may not work that 
  way. A shell for instance could fall at a harmless distance away from a ward, 
  causing a patient a minor cut. The patients would then promptly desert the hospital, 
  effectively closing it. The hospital staff would then have nothing to show for 
  defying their ministry. The L.T.T.E. by all accounts was worried.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>In Colombo, the Jaffna 
  Hospital doctors received crucial support for their cause from the Indian High 
  Commission. Given the wide ranging pressure, the President and the National 
  Security Minister agreed to lift the closure order if a fire-free zone could 
  be negotiated around the hospital between the L.T.T.E. and the Sri Lankan army. 
  For while the G.M.O.A. accepted the word of the Jaffna doctors that the hospital 
  to the best of their knowledge had not been used to fire at the Jaffna Fort, 
  the National Security ministry stood by the contrary. It was then felt that 
  such an agreement of a fire free zone would solve the problem. This was a victory 
  for common humanity. In their enthusiasm, the doctors took it upon themselves 
  to arrange such negotiations. It was agreed that the telephone link between 
  the fort and the hospital would be restored and that Captain Kotelawela who 
  had previously developed a rapport with Kittu, Rahim and some other L.T.T.E. 
  leaders would be available at the Jaffna Fort on the afternoon of 10 May. Hopes 
  rose high. One of the Jaffna newspapers got wind of this from what was thought 
  of as a private talk and stated that the planned negotiations were announced 
  at a press conference at the hospital.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>At this point the 
  L.T.T.E. pounced on the doctors. They were found fault with for arranging meetings 
  for the L.T.T.E. without their authority. Further, they said, it was through 
  the press that they were being informed of this meeting. Apart from a possible 
  technical blunder involving the press, the doctors felt that they were acting 
  for the common good. No commitment at this time was forthcoming from the L.T.T.E.. 
  Later the doctors learnt from Captain Kotelawela that he had contacted the L.T.T.E. 
  independently and had arranged to meet with them the following morning. Captain 
  Kotelawela further added that he had come on &quot;multiple missions&quot; and 
  had not sounded as if the hospital matter was amongst the key subjects. It was 
  learnt the following morning that the L.T.T.E. had not kept its appointment, 
  assuming there was one, with the Captain who had been kept impatiently waiting. 
  Subsequently the L.T.T.E. put forward a demand that since it could not trust 
  the government, it was willing to talk if 5 persons nominated by them would 
  be present. These included Dr. Ratnapriya, National Secretary of the G.M.O.A., 
  and the Rev. Fr. Yohan Devananda. The L.T.T.E. should have known that its demand 
  that a representative of the International Red Cross, the I.R.C., should be 
  present would not be met. The government agreed to 4 of the delegates and added 
  that while it cannot admit an I.R.C. representative, the L.T.T.E. could choose 
  anyone else from this country it could trust. The doctors suggested that the 
  L.T.T.E. could as a compromise, suggest an employee of the Indian High Commission.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>The L.T.T.E.'s effective 
  rejection was protracted. In the meantime, the matter had received so much publicity 
  that the government found itself unable to go ahead with the closure of the 
  hospital. The L.T.T.E. had played its characteristic game, abusing the good 
  intentions of the Jaffna doctors, the goodwill of the G.M.O.A., and the residual 
  decency in the government to gain its own ends. For the moment the L.T.T.E. 
  had won. It was to try the same gamble during Thileepan's fast in September, 
  win for a start, and then lose by overplaying its hand. For the Sri Lankan government, 
  it was the end of the road for negotiations which it had tried perhaps half-heartedly 
  in deference to international opinion and some members of its cabinet. It had 
  strengthened its drive for a military solution to its Tamil problem by silencing 
  critics within and showing up the L.T.T.E. as implacable and irresponsible in 
  the eyes of the world. In this sense the Sri Lankan government had not lost. 
  For its part, the government had not behaved as though it was dealing with human 
  beings over whom it claimed sovereignty. Even the Geneva convention provided 
  for far better treatment during war for the population on the opposing side. 
  A senior citizen with personal contacts at the Indian High Commission, said 
  at this time that India was not more than nominally interested in pushing the 
  December 19th proposals. It would appear that India was building up a case for 
  direct intervention of some kind. The decision was taken perhaps, sometime between 
  January and May 1987. When the Sri Lankan government had launched an offensive 
  earlier in the year, Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi of India had warned that if 
  a political solution is not reached, the level of violence in Sri Lanka &quot;will&quot; 
  increase. The message was not lost in Colombo. The L.T.T.E.'s actions, together 
  with the government reprisals against the Tamils, had served to build up India's 
  case.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>In one respect, the 
  support received by the Jaffna doctors for their cause from the Indian High 
  Commission was fateful, as events proved. During the Indian offensive on Jaffna 
  later in October that year, the Jaffna hospital authorities assumed that because 
  India had in the past been a friend of the hospital, she would exercise extreme 
  consideration for the hospital during the offensive. As it turned out, the need 
  for the hospital had been as great in October as it had been in May. Several 
  hundred persons, ordinary men, women and children, who were victims of Indian 
  shelling were in need of urgent medical care. When the Indians took Jaffna town 
  on 21st October, there were no signs that they had given any thought to the 
  hospital.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>A medical Consultant, 
  reflecting on the events of May in light of October's harrowing experiences, 
  said: &quot;One can now appreciate the National Security Minister, Lalith Athulathmudali's 
  wanting to close Jaffna Hospital. He knew that if an attempt was to be made 
  to take Jaffna, while advancing from the Fort, something embarrassing was bound 
  to happen at the hospital. Having faced bad publicity over the years, the Sri 
  Lankan government was used to thinking along these lines. The Indians did not 
  seem to have a clue.&quot; Another Consultant-Professor on the same subject 
  said: &quot;We should have closed the hospital on 11 October. But people are 
  concerned about patients and they are used to cutting it fine. By their past 
  concern, the Indians had encouraged us to do this.&quot;</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>On the other hand, 
  the Sri Lankan government had learnt much from this experience of May. When 
  they launched Operation Liberation three weeks' later, they took extreme care 
  over Pt. Pedro hospital. The Sri Lankan army was helped in this by the fact 
  that the L.T.T.E. had withdrawn from the area around Pt. Pedro hospital a day 
  before the army advanced from Nelliady. The Indian army did not have this advantage. 
  One should be careful not to make comparisons from this. A few months earlier 
  the Sri Lankan air force had bombed the hospital at Adampan. Adampan was a remote 
  area in the Mannar district. The operation in Jaffna, thanks in part to India, 
  had to be done under the spotlight of international publicity. The difference 
  between Adampan and Jaffna was well understood by the Sri Lankan government. 
  If the L.T.T.E. had learnt anything, it was the value of bad publicity for the 
  other side. During the Indian offensive of October, the L.T.T.E. would itself 
  commission lawyers to obtain affidavits from victims, for whose misfortune, 
  the L.T.T.E. must itself share the responsibility.<a href="#top">[Top]</a></p>
