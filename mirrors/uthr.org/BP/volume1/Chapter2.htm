<p align=center style='text-align:center;'><b>Chapter 2</b></p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center;'><b>SOME MILESTONES IN THE DEVELOPMENT 
  OF TAMIL POLITICAL CONSCIOUSNESS</b></p>
<p><b>2.1  The Youth Congress</b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='letter-spacing:-.1pt'>The first great political movement that took root 
  in Jaffna was the Ceylon Youth Congress. This movement came into being around 
  1926 and had its base amongst the educated middle-class youth, especially young 
  graduates of Jaffna from Indian Universities and the newly founded Ceylon University 
  College, and high school students. It was greatly inspired by the Indian independence 
  movement and looked up to its leading figures such as Mahathma Gandhi and Jawaharlal 
  Nehru. Like the Congress in India, the causes it advocated were secularism, 
  a non-sectarian Ceylonese nationalism and independence from Britain. For this 
  reason it enjoyed much respect from Sinhalese intellectuals in the South. It 
  drew enthusiasm and morale boosts from visits of leading Indian personalities. 
  Gandhi visited Jaffna in 1927 and Nehru in 1932. Kamaladevi Chattopadyaya who 
  addressed the opening session of the Ceylon Youth Congress in 1931, is said 
  to have taken Jaffna by storm. Not only leading personalities from India, but 
  also eminent Sinhalese from the South, like S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike addressed 
  Youth Congress sessions. It was at the Youth Congress sessions that S.W.R.D. 
  advocated for the first time a federal constitution for Ceylon. Some of the 
  leading personalities of the Youth Congress were Handy Perinpanayagam, J.V. 
  Chelliah, S. Kulendran (who, later, was enthroned as the Bishop of the Jaffna 
  Diocese of the Church of South India), Orator Subramaniam, K. Nesiah, N. Sabaratnam, 
  and A. E. Tamber.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>The Youth Congress reached its 
  high point when it organised in the Tamil areas a boycott of elections under 
  the Donoughmore Constitution of 1931, for the reason that the constitution did 
  not offer Poorna Swaraj (complete independence). In the succeeding years the 
  Youth Congress fell into decline, unable to resist the pressure of communal 
  politics. Perhaps they were unable to come out with a leadership that could 
  combine idealism with charisma, essential for mass based politics under universal 
  suffrage. Nevertheless many of the Youth Congress figures were great men who 
  left their mark. Consciences had been awakened on the caste issue and the ideals 
  of cosmopolitan, secular democracy had been instilled in many young minds. Several 
  of their leaders such as Handy Perinpanayagam, Orator Subramaniam, N. Sabaratnam 
  and K. Nesiah went on to make a distinct contribution, and, as educationists, 
  remained loyal exponents of their youthful ideals. They also maintained their 
  ties with the leading contemporaries of Mahathma Gandhi into the 1970's. The 
  most important legacy of the Youth Congress from the point of the present, is 
  the position enjoyed by India in the minds of the Tamil People. India for the 
  Tamils, came to represent high standards - virtue, moral edification and ideals 
  of non-violence. Pictures of Mahathma Gandhi and other Indian leaders came to 
  adorn many Tamil homes. This affection was enhanced by already existing ties 
  of religion, education and language.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><b><span style='letter-spacing:-.1pt'>2.2 The F.P. 
  and the T.U.L.F.</span></b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='letter-spacing:-.1pt'>As a result of S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike's Sinhalese 
  only bill of 1956, the Federal Party (F.P.) under S.J.V. Chelvanayakam became 
  the chief repository of Tamil hopes and interests. Significantly, the Satyagraha 
  campaign launched by the F.P. in 1961 was modelled on Mahathma Gandhi's example. 
  From 1956 to 1983 Tamil political thinking developed under the impact of the 
  anti-Tamil riots of 1956, 1958, 1977, 1981, and 1983 together with mounting 
  discrimination and a series of broken promises by successive governments which 
  promised to settle Tamil grievances. The uprising by the Sinhalese youth of 
  the J.V.P. in 1971 had its impact on Tamil youth. By the early 1970's a section 
  of Tamil youth in the universities and high schools had begun to think in terms 
  of violence. But the F.P. continued to espouse non-violence. The official ideology 
  of its successor, the T.U.L.F., remains non-violence to this day. The other 
  events which had an impact on the Tamil Youth were, a system of standardisation 
  introduced by Mrs. Bandaranaike's government in 1970 which made it more difficult 
  for Tamil students to enter the University, and the birth of Bangladesh. These 
  latter events made a strong impression on their minds. At this point lessons 
  in karate and judo began to be organised in Jaffna. A group of Tamil undergraduates 
  at Peradeniya were in the ideological forefront of this new tendency. They began 
  to think of economic self-sufficiency for the Tamil areas. But a fully fledged 
  rebel movement like the P.L.O .was still only a distant possibility. Many of 
  them thought of a simple plan inspired by Bangladesh. Their plan was to have 
  a limited militant movement, plan for economic self-sufficiency and once U.D.I 
  .was declared India was to come in and finish the job quickly. It may be noted 
  that almost all of these pioneering youths have now left the country, for good.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>The effect of all this was to weaken 
  democratic ideals amongst Tamils. A new romanticism developed where political 
  activists thought in terms of military structures, secret societies and undercover 
  work. To have different opinions amounted to treachery. Tolerance and open discussion 
  were no longer welcomed.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>The Federal Party was quick to 
  cash in on the new mood of totalitarianism. A senior journalist and a long time 
  observer of Jaffna has this to say: </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='letter-spacing:-.1pt'>&quot;In 1972 
  I was at a meeting where S.J.V. Chelvanayakam, the leader of the F.P. was present 
  on the platform. Mr. Kasi Ananthan, a popular platform speaker, who is now a 
  member of the L.T.T.E., told the audience:</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='letter-spacing:-.1pt'>Mr. Duraiappa, 
  Mr. Subramaniam, Mr. Arulampalam and Mr. Anandasangeri are enemies of the Tamil 
  nation. They do not deserve a natural death. Nor do they deserve to die in an 
  accident. The Tamil people, especially the youth, must decide how they should 
  die.... </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='letter-spacing:-.1pt'>&quot;I knew 
  that this was going to lead to anarchy. I was angry and said so to my colleagues. 
  The only thing my colleagues could say in mitigation was that Mr. Chelvanayakam's 
  hearing was bad and consequently he would not have known what was said. This 
  was no satisfactory excuse for a party leader. This speech was editorially quoted 
  in the Suthanthiran, a paper owned by Mr. Chelvanayakam. Such a speech which 
  apparently had the blessings of the Tamil leadership was a foretaste of things 
  to come. In the succeeding years we were taught unquestioning compliance with 
  political authority. If the F.P. or its successor, the T.U.L.F., announced a 
  three day hartal, we had to comply and stay at home; there was no question of 
  discussion. Anyone who did not comply could have expected some young men to 
  come and beat him up. The seeds were sown for the growth of totalitarian militant 
  groups and for the methods of violence they employed.&quot;</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>It must also be mentioned that 
  Mrs. Bandaranaike's government contributed to these developments by the methods 
  it adopted. It arrested 42 Tamil youths in 1972 and detained them without charges 
  for two years. These youths were mainly involved in protesting against standardisation 
  which restricted the entrance of Tamils to the University. The actual offences 
  were often nothing more than putting up posters. The Federal Party's mild demands 
  for Tamil rights in parliament were treated with contempt. Dr. Colvin R. de 
  Silva's constitution of 1972 had the ring of a deliberate slap on the face. 
  Discrimination against Tamils and corruption became much more open. The one 
  mitigating factor was that the import restriction policies of the government 
  provided opportunities and prosperity for the enterprising Jaffna farmer. An 
  event which had considerable impact on Tamil political thought was the police 
  attack on the International Tamil Research Conference hosted in Jaffna in January 
  1974. Nine persons died by accidental electrocution during this unprovoked attack, 
  which took place in the presence of international scholars. It was a measure 
  of Mrs. Bandaranaike's arrogance that she refused to order an inquiry. The first 
  shot in the Tamil insurgency was fired when Mr. Alfred Duraiyappa, the Mayor 
  of Jaffna who was close to Mrs. Bandaranaike, was assassinated in 1975. Mr. 
  Duraiyappa was a popular man whose funeral was well attended.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>By 1976, the leading Tamil 
  parties including the F.P., the Tamil Congress of Mr. G.G. Ponnampalam and Mr. 
  Thondaman's Ceylon Workers Congress representing plantation Tamils and Prof. 
  C. Suntheralingam, a prominent Tamil nationalist, had combined to form the Tamil 
  United Liberation Front (T.U.L.F.). In this year (1976) was adopted the Vaddukoddai 
  resolution which put forward an independent state of Tamil Eelam as being the 
  solution to the problems of the Tamils. This state was to be won by non-violent 
  means.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>It can be safely assumed that 
  there was no viable plan to fight for such a state. In a public debate conducted 
  in Chunnakam in 1975, presided over by Mr. Orator Subramaniam, two of Mr. Subramaniam's 
  eminent students, Mr. N. Shanmugathasan, Communist Party (Peking Wing) and Mr. 
  V. Dharmalingam, M.P. (T.U.L.F.) debated the pros and cons of the separate state. 
  Mr. Shanmugathasan challenged Mr. Dharmalingam to state his plan of action. 
  Mr. Dharmalingam replied that it was a party secret. Several in the audience 
  clamoured for a more definite answer. Orator said later: &quot;I had ties of 
  friendship and respect to both my students and I knew that I was chosen as Chairman 
  because in Chunnakam I was perhaps well qualified to control the crowd. Seeing 
  that things were going too far, I intervened as Chairman and decreed that it 
  was Mr. Dharmalingam's right to keep a party secret. But the simple truth was 
  that there was no such plan.&quot; By now Mr. Chelvanayakam was in a state of 
  poor health and Mr. A. Amirthalingam, the T.U.L.F. Secretary, had begun to play 
  a leading role in the party. According to one report, Mr. M. Thiruchelvam, a 
  senior member of the T.U.L.F. and ex-minister who was in Colombo at the time 
  the resolution for a separate state was adopted, sensing danger, asked Mr. Amirthalingam, 
  &quot;What is the meaning of this?&quot; Mr. Amirthalingam replied that this 
  resolution was adopted under pressure from the youth and that when the time 
  comes to negotiate with the government, a compromise can be reached. This, as 
  future events showed, was the true position of the T.U.L.F..</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><b>2.3 The Years 1977-81</b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='letter-spacing:-.1pt'>The new U.N.P. government which came to power in 
  July 1977 raised hopes that it would solve the problems of the Tamils. It did 
  away with standardisation for a time. Time showed that the government was only 
  toying with the problem. The 1977 race riots made the average Tamil feel that 
  the Tamils needed much firmer guarantees concerning their place in the country 
  and an autonomous status for their homelands which would include control over 
  colonisation. The government was in no way prepared to meet these reasonable 
  claims. Instead ministers such as Cyril Mathew and Gamini Dissanaike used the 
  resources of their ministries to further Sinhalese colonisation especially in 
  the Eastern province. Cyril Mathew kept on discovering ancient Buddhist shrines 
  in the Trincomalee area. The anger and helplessness of the Tamils provided a 
  natural boost for militant groups.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>One cannot deal with the question 
  without looking into the manner in which Sinhalese fears were awakened. Having 
  promised Tamil Eelam, the T.U.L.F. under Mr. Amirthalingam kept on saying that 
  they had a secret plan to bring about this event. Having directly or indirectly 
  aided the growth of the militant movement, the T.U.L.F. had to ride it. The 
  secret plan story with elaborations drew applause from audiences. Rumours abounded 
  to the effect that some foreign powers, overseas Tamils, or both, were to provide 
  military succour for the birth of Tamil Eelam. Even by the end of 1977 many 
  believed that fighter planes had been purchased for that task. The average person 
  listening to speeches given by the T.U.L.F. took them to mean that non-violence 
  was just a facade and that the real thrust was being planned by enhancing the 
  militants' capability. But when pressed for comment by audiences of a different 
  kind, the T.U.L.F. would become a group of urbane Western-educated gentlemen 
  committed to non-violence. All this was not lost on the Sinhalese. When challenged 
  by Sinhalese to condemn the militants' violence, the T.U.L.F. would hedge. There 
  was no doubt, for instance, that the functioning of the banks was essential 
  for the Jaffna economy and that the prosperity of the Jaffna farmer depended 
  crucially on the banks. The police force was in many ways racist and flawed. 
  Yet, it was also performing necessary functions towards the maintenance of order. 
  Subsequently police were deployed to protect banks and vehicles transporting 
  cash. Several of these policemen were killed on duty. Yet the Tamil public treated 
  it as a sad, but necessary part of the Eelam game. The T.U.L.F. was silent.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>As a result, a racist picture 
  of the average Tamil as a scheming opportunist came to have a ring of credibility 
  in the eyes of the average Sinhalese man. It then made it easier to arouse Sinhalese 
  fears of being overwhelmed by Tamils and create the kind of feeling: &quot;The 
  Tamils should be taught a lesson&quot;. Provoking such distrust made the anti-Tamil 
  riots of 1981 and 1983 more probable. At the same time the T.U.L.F. had no tangible 
  means in its possession to safe-guard the Tamils from such an outcome. Meanwhile 
  the T.U.L.F. neglected party democracy and its grass-roots organisation and 
  had adopted secret negotiations with the government. This resulted in increasing 
  dissatisfaction amongst its supporters.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>The T.U.L.F.'s Vaddukottai resolution 
  calling for a separate state of Tamil Eelam made a deep emotional impact on 
  Tamils, both locally and abroad. But it took the 1977 anti-Tamil violence to 
  give it life. Many middle class Tamils who had regarded Colombo as their home 
  had agreed on principle that the Tamils must move back to their traditional 
  homelands for their safety and economic prosperity and the preservation of their 
  national identity and make them economically viable. Even before the 1977 riots, 
  the Tamils had been becoming increasingly anxious because of discrimination 
  in employment and in education. Several Hill Tamils had been displaced during 
  the 1977 violence. A key problem as seen by the Tamils was the protection of 
  border areas such as Trincomalee, Mullaitivu and Vavuniya, where the resources 
  of the state had been used in settling Sinhalese. The 1958 and 1977 violence 
  had shown that it was in these areas that Tamils were the most vulnerable. Although 
  the school leaving Jaffna Tamil was very conscious that these areas were part 
  of his homeland, experience had shown that it was not easy to motivate him to 
  settle and make a living off the land - the earnings from which could be well 
  above white collar government service salaries. Tamil refugees of Indian origin 
  were readily accepted to fill this void. Many of the Tamil elite advocated this 
  migration because they were cheap labour and would serve as a convenient buffer 
  between the Sinhalese and the Jaffna Tamil. C. Chandrahasan, S. J. V. Chelvanayakam's 
  son, once made a remark of such import to a foreign journalist. The leadership 
  in settling these areas came from some highly motivated Tamils. Several of them 
  later acquired links with the incipient militant movement. Three leading names 
  amongst these pioneers were Mr. A. David, a senior Architect and the late Dr. 
  Rajasundaram and his wife Shantini (nee Karalasingam) also a doctor. The husband 
  and wife were in Britain when the 1977 riots broke out. They decided to return 
  without delay to take up this pioneering work. While Shantini ran the Vavuniya 
  clinic on a social service basis, Rajasundaram became the moving force behind 
  the movement Gandhiyam. Gandhiyam was a charitable organisation through which 
  agricultural advice, facilities and materials were provided for refugee families 
  wanting to settle in project areas around Vavuniya. Volunteer workers ran schools 
  and day care centres for children while providing advice and assistance to the 
  elders. The U.S. agency C.A.R.E. supplied packets of Triposha -- balanced cereal 
  food for children. N.O.V.I.B. and O.X.F.A.M. were amongst the charities that 
  helped Gandhiyam. Within two years these former refugees were producing plentiful 
  quantities of nutritious cereals such as Ulunthu, the prices of which reached 
  a record low as a result.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>Another organisation which became 
  famous at this time was the Tamil Refugees Rehabilitation Organisation (T.R.R.O.). 
  Amongst the committed officials of the T.R.R.O. were its founder President Nithyanantha 
  and its founder Secretary K. Kanthasamy. Kanthasamy had been a very successful 
  corporate lawyer and his life was to become one of selfless devotion to the 
  cause of Tamil freedom, and the wider cause of human rights at an international 
  level. His disappearance in mid-1988 was a result of the insidious growth of 
  terror within the Tamil body-politic that was to destroy some of its finest 
  sons.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>The T.R.R.O. designed projects 
  for the settlement of displaced persons, canvassed funds and implemented the 
  projects either directly or through organisations such as Ghandiyam. The Kent 
  and Dollar farms owed their origin to the pioneering spirit of some of the youth 
  and elders of this time. Both were integrated agricultural settlements. Several 
  Tamils living overseas became infected with this pioneering spirit when letters 
  of appeal reached them. Groups of people sprang up in places like London, Singapore, 
  and Ibadan (Nigeria), who held discussions on projects that could economically 
  stabilise the Tamil homeland and collected money to send towards existing projects. 
  The Standing Committee of Tamil Speaking Peoples (S.C.O.T.) is an organisation 
  of Tamil professional people that came into being in London during this period. 
  In the Tamil homeland itself there was a sense of buoyancy as several professionals 
  took up residence there and gave their time to designing and implementing economic 
  projects. During these early stages, the militants were known to be present 
  around the settlements, but few from the settlements had any links with them. 
  The thrust was on economic development and rehabilitation. The leadership of 
  the T.U.L.F. was unquestioned. Yet for all the enthusiasm overseas, the actual 
  participation of overseas Tamils in terms of their numbers and resources was 
  small. In Britain where the Ceylon Tamil settlers numbered tens of thousands, 
  the annual income of the S.C.O.T. was only in the region of ,6,000. Those who 
  started rehabilitation work in the field, had hoped for massive support from 
  Tamils living abroad. They got their money. But nearly all of it from Christian 
  charities in the West. Nevertheless Tamils living overseas maintained a keen 
  interest in what was going on at home and the actions of the militants became 
  the subject of much drawing room talk.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>During the year 1978 the militant 
  group, the Tamil Tigers, carried out a spate of bank robberies and killings 
  of police officers. The most sensational of these was the killing of Inspector 
  Bastianpillai and some other police officers who were with him, after the police 
  had successfully apprehended some militants. Other sensational events were the 
  robbing of the banks at Thirunelvely, Neervely and Kilinochchi (by the group 
  P.L.O.T.E.) and the bomb blast which destroyed the Avro passenger aircraft plying 
  between Jaffna and Colombo shortly after it had landed on the tarmac at Ratmalana 
  and everyone had disembarked.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>As a purely security problem, 
  the Tamil militancy had gone beyond routine policing. But as a political problem, 
  it was well within control. The T.U.L.F. was willing to settle for a fairly 
  modest grant of autonomy for the Tamil areas that included some compromise on 
  land settlement. The militants at this point of time respected the T.U.L.F. 
  and were not challenging it. But the government decided to play tough, and given 
  the racist attitudes of some of its leading members, every action of the government's 
  began to be seen as punitive. An Act of Parliament in 1978 proscribed the Tamil 
  Tigers.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>Two events towards the end of 
  1978 alienated the Tamils further. Mr. Cyril Mathew, Minister for Industries 
  in the U.N.P. government and a regular Tamil basher, had a press conference 
  with P.P.G.L. Siriwardene, Professor of Chemistry at the University of Colombo. 
  It was announced at this conference that evidence had been found to prove that 
  Tamil examiners had cheated by awarding excessively high marks to Tamil candidates. 
  The matter was debated in parliament . But no inquiry was ordered. The allegation 
  sounded convincing to many Sinhalese. With the Tamils it left a bad taste. Many 
  responsible Tamils who studied the matter were convinced that the allegations 
  would not have stood up to an impartial inquiry. By allowing one of its ministers 
  freely to make irresponsible allegations, the government had increased racial 
  feeling against Tamils. The allegations also served as a smoke screen for the 
  reintroduction of an indirect system of racial quotas for University admissions. 
  It was the new U.N.P. government that had scrapped, as a gesture towards Tamils, 
  the system of standardisation introduced by the previous government to restrict 
  Tamil university admissions. Many Tamils would have agreed to the modification 
  of the principle of pure merit by means of non-racial criteria to help the underprivileged. 
  That would not have needed a drama which subjected Tamils to hurtful public 
  vilification. This represented the same irresponsible streak in the Jayewardene 
  government which made Jayewardene tell the Tamils who were victimised by the 
  1977 racial violence that they will have war if they want war. Discrimination 
  against Tamils in government jobs continued as repeatedly pointed out in letters 
  to the President by the T.U.L.F. leader, Mr. Amirthalingam</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>The other event was the cyclone 
  that devastated the Eastern Province in December 1978. Tamil leaders and Members 
  of Parliament complained bitterly about blatant discrimination against Tamil 
  victims in the provision of relief. There were several instances where material 
  assistance provided by foreign governments did not reach the victims. In one 
  instance, it was revealed in parliament that a large quantity of good quality 
  sarees donated for the victims by India had been disposed of through a state 
  trading agency. It was claimed belatedly in reply to a query in parliament that 
  the proceeds from the sale went into the distress fund. </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>However, government indifference 
  provided an opportunity for strengthening Tamil solidarity which was not missed. 
  Again students from the University of Jaffna played a leading role joined in 
  by social service and religious organisations. Students went from house to house 
  collecting money for relief. A large number of lorries left for the East carrying 
  cadjan<a
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span> [1] </span></a><sup>1</sup>, food 
  and clothing. It was indeed an exciting period where Tamil national consciousness 
  was riding high. Everyone wanted to be part of it, even the passive U.N.P.-voting 
  Colombo Tamils who had habitually cold shouldered the enthusiasm of their provincial 
  brethren. These middle class Colombo Tamils had preferred to be known as urbane, 
  cosmopolitan and English speaking and were usually not given to nationalist 
  notions.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>An important step in the government's 
  effort at finding a military solution to the Tamil problem was the passing of 
  the P.T.A .(Prevention of Terrorism Act) by parliament in July 1979. All the 
  while the majority of Tamils were hoping that some compromise would be reached 
  between the T.U.L.F. and the government that would settle the problem. But what 
  happened after the passage of the P.T.A., though on a minor scale by today's 
  standards, was to increase Tamil anger against the government and, consequently, 
  support for the militants' cause.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>The following extract from Prof. 
  S. J. Tambiah's book, &quot;<i>Sri Lanka - Ethnic Fratricide and The Dismantling 
  of Democracy</i>&quot; gives the main features of the P.T.A., together with 
  comparisons with the corresponding British Act.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><b><span
style='letter-spacing:-.1pt'>THE P.T.A.: </span></b><span style='letter-spacing:
-.1pt'>The main features of the P.T.A. are: &quot;It allows confessions made to 
  the police possibly under duress, as admissible evidence. Moreover, the act 
  declares that any document found in the custody, control, or possession of anyone 
  accused of an offence under the Act, or his agent or representative, can be 
  used in evidence, against him at his trial, without calling its author or maker 
  into account, and the contents of such a document can be construed as evidence 
  of the facts stated in it... The P.T.A. can be retroactive in its implementation... 
  Provides for prison terms for conviction ranging from 5 to 20 years or life. 
  These provisions of the P.T.A. have been interpreted by the police and army 
  as an open door policy that permits arrest without warrant of any person... 
  A person may be detained for periods up to 18 months if the minister had reason 
  to suspect him of being associated with unlawful activity... It defines as unlawful 
  certain acts, including the speaking or writing of words intended to cause religious, 
  social, or communal disharmony, or feelings of ill will or hostility between 
  communities or racial or religious groups.&quot;</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><b><span
style='letter-spacing:-.1pt'>THE BRITISH ACT: </span></b><span
style='letter-spacing:-.1pt'>Prof. Tambiah offers a reply to those apologists 
  for Sri Lanka who see the United Kingdom act, enacted in response to the situation 
  in Northern Ireland as setting a precedent for the P.T.A.: &quot;The U.K. legislation 
  bearing the same name (Prevention of Terrorism) was adopted in 1974, repealed, 
  and then re-enacted in 1978 with some amendments, It is much less far-reaching 
  than its Sri Lankan counterpart in its infringement of human rights. For one 
  thing, the U.K. act defines terrorism more narrowly as 'the use of violence 
  for political ends,' and includes under this rubric any use of violence for 
  the purpose of frightening any section of the public or the public as a whole. 
  For another, the same Act limits the maximum period during which a person may 
  be detained without charge at seven days; there is no way a person can be held 
  incommunicado without trial for a prolonged period, as the Sri Lankan act permits. 
  Finally the Act in the U.K. remains in force for 12 months and its continuance 
  must be ratified by Parliament.&quot;</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='letter-spacing:-.1pt'>According to Virginia Leary (&quot;<i>Ethnic Conflict 
  in Sri Lanka</i>&quot;, International Commission of Jurists, July to August, 
  1981): &quot;A number of the objectionable features in the Sri Lankan Act are 
  similar to the provisions widely criticised in the 1967 Terrorism Act of South 
  Africa.&quot;</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>Following the passage of this 
  act, the military was for the first time given an active role in the Tamil areas. 
  The President's nephew, Brigadier Weeratunge, was sent to Jaffna in mid-1979 
  with an order from the President to wipe out terrorism by the end of the year. 
  Soon afterwards, six Tamil youths disappeared after being taken into custody. 
  The bodies of two of them, Inpam and Selvam, were found near the beach in Jaffna 
  with gunshot injuries. Reports of torture became widespread.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>Amongst Tamils in general, there 
  was a feeling of optimism that they were forging ahead and that the government 
  could not win. Rightly or wrongly, the Tamils were proud of the young and the 
  militant youth. The nickname for a Tamil in the South changed from &quot;Panamkottai&quot; 
  (Palmyrah nut) to &quot;Kottiya&quot; (Tiger). The Tamils no longer cringed, 
  afraid of their identity being known. The Tigers gave them back a sense of identity 
  and dignity. This was also the time that internal killings had started sporadically 
  within the militant movement.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>With this euphoria went many 
  unresolved contradictions in attitudes as well as conduct. The economic development 
  of Tamil areas went on at a very slow pace. Little capital was coming this way, 
  whether from the government or from foreign sources. The government itself was 
  part of the cause. Tamils complained bitterly that Colombo-based Tamil entrepreneurs 
  who made large quantities of money from the Tamil man would not re-invest even 
  a small fraction of it in Tamil areas. At the same time, they spent large sums 
  doing favours for politicians. In the meantime dependence on Colombo increased. 
  The pattern of migration was towards employment abroad, especially in the Middle 
  East and was not calculated to increase economic activity in the Tamil areas. 
  The money from overseas that was pouring in was largely spent on building houses, 
  even on agricultural land, the purchase of jewellery and consumer items such 
  as television sets and video-decks. Again profits were reaped by traders in 
  Colombo. Travel between Jaffna and Colombo increased considerably. It was only 
  a few who used their savings to start small industries such as mechanical workshops.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>Many Tamils did see that they 
  were treading on dangerous ground. But people were reluctant to speak out. The 
  situation was made worse by the government's natural bent towards thuggery. 
</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>It was about this time that 
  several left-wing political groups in the South who had been talking about armed 
  action for years started looking admiringly at what the Tamil militants were 
  doing. The latter had been successful in alarming the state. These were written 
  about for the first time by Dayan Jayatilleke and were published in the Lanka 
  Guardian. Some leftist intellectuals from the South even spoke of Tamil Eelam 
  being the cradle of future revolution. Ideas of Lenin and Stalin on small nations 
  of minorities featured in intellectual discussions dealing with minorities and 
  secession. The traditional Left which had been somewhat discredited by its past 
  performance was being splintered, giving rise to new groups such as the N.S.S.P. 
  (Nava Sama Samaja Party).</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>To break the stalemate on the 
  political front, the T.U.L.F. commenced discussions with parties of the Left 
  (S.L.F.P., L.S.S.P. and C.P.) with a view to forming an electoral alliance. 
  This was breaking new ground as the T.U.L.F. had been instinctively distrustful 
  of the Left as opposed to the U.N.P.. Many critics maintained that such a bias 
  flew in the face of experience and can be attributed to the natural Right-wing 
  tendencies within the T.U.L.F.. Initial exchanges raised hopes. But the exercise 
  was abruptly broken off by the T.U.L.F.. Sources within the T.U.L.F. confided 
  that they did so on a strong indication that it may give rise to organised race 
  riots against the Tamils. Negotiations commenced instead with the U.N.P. government 
  under the mediation of Prof. A. J. Wilson (Lecturer in political science in 
  Canada and son-in-law of S. J. V. Chelvanayakam) and Dr. Neelan Tiruchelvam 
  (American trained lawyer and son of an F.P. minister). Both had good relations 
  with the government, whose open economic policies they agreed with. The result 
  was the District Development Councils (D.D.C.s) which were meant to give the 
  Tamils some control over their land and ease discrimination in employment by 
  the devolution of certain subjects to the districts.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>Moreover, these Councils were 
  ill-fated from the start, when the Council elections in July 1981 resulted in 
  such untoward incidents as the burning of the Jaffna Public Library by government 
  forces. Moreover, this was the first time after the Duraiyappah killing that 
  political terror by Tamil militants against rivals of the T.U.L.F. was displayed. 
  Mr. Thiagarajah, a retired school principal, ex-M.P. and U.N.P. candidate was 
  shot dead. Also killed was Mr. Nadarajah, a U.N.P. organiser.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>Despite some disorganised interference 
  by the government machinery, the T.U.L.F. was returned in all Tamil districts. 
  But the District Councils did not work because the government was not genuinely 
  committed to them. This put the T.U.L.F. at a seemingly dead end. The militant 
  leaders became restive about accepting the paramountcy of the T.U.L.F.. Some 
  of the T.U.L.F.'s backers too began to feel that the T.U.L.F. was ineffective. 
  By July 1983 the initiative had passed on to the militants. Many observers felt 
  that the T.U.L.F., whether under threat or not, had made a serious miscalculation 
  in breaking off negotiations with the Left and coming to a deal with the government 
  which the latter had no intention of honouring, whether under threat or not. 
  Dr. A. J. Wilson was initially very positive about the political solution contained 
  in the D.D.C.'s. But the success of the D.D.C.'s depended on willingness and 
  foresight on the part of the government to devolve real power. On nearly all 
  matters where a devolution of responsibility had to evolve, the centre used 
  every hidden mechanism to maintain its hold. As a typical example, the Jaffna 
  D.D.C. which proposed to start a ferry service between K.K.S. and Nagapatanam 
  in order to ease considerably, travel to India which otherwise required an expensive 
  and round about journey through Mannar or Colombo. The Jaffna D.D.C. was told 
  to lay off on this matter. This was a bit of a joke because an unofficial boat 
  service operated by competent mariners had always ferried people from Jaffna 
  to India in less than three hours. As another example, since one of the Tamil 
  fears was security, which was now a virtual monopoly of the Sinhalese state, 
  there was provision in the D.D.C.'s for the creation of Home Guards. The T.U.L.F. 
  had accepted in good faith that the wherewithal to train and maintain them would 
  be forthcoming, for if not such a provision would have been meaningless. But 
  this is how it turned out. A senior official described the position of these 
  Home Guards as being that of a far less exciting version of the Boy Scouts. 
  They would come paying their own bus fare, paying for their uniform and paying 
  for their own cup of tea. It had no chance of getting off the ground. Ultimately 
  the D.D.C.'s were left with a minuscule decentralised budget, not even amounting 
  to one percent of the national budget. When such difficulties arose the T.U.L.F. 
  would have discussions with the President and then announce that the matter 
  had been resolved. These expectations too would be frustrated in due course.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>The government inspired violence 
  and attempts at cheating at the elections by themselves spelt a bad omen for 
  the D.D.C.'s. Some people were killed in this violence. The burning of the Jaffna 
  Public Library and the Eelanadu Press were widely regarded as acts of cultural 
  genocide. There were as usual members of the local population who would use 
  public distress for personal gain. Once again university students threw themselves 
  into the task of reconstruction by forming well-organised teams to collect funds 
  and books.<a href="#top">[Top]</a></p>
