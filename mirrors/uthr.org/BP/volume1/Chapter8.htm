<p style='text-align:justify;'><b>8.1 The Airdrop and the L.T.T.E.'s Dilemma</b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:9.0pt;letter-spacing:-.1pt'>With the Indian airdrop of relief 
  supplies on 4 June, the Sri Lankan army was forced to call off its offensive 
  in Jaffna after scenting victory. The L.T.T.E. had been administered an unpleasant 
  shock and was reeling. India had demonstrated to the Tamils that it was ultimately 
  India on whom the Tamils must depend. India now wanted a presence in Jaffna 
  and there was much talk between Colombo and Delhi. It was agreed that Indian 
  relief supplies would be distributed to the people of Jaffna, jointly by a team 
  of Indian and Ceylonese Red Cross personnel. India underlined the allegedly 
  humanitarian nature of its mission. During Operation Liberation and earlier 
  All India Radio had given publicity to the L.T.T.E.'s version of civilian casualties. 
  The figure went up to 2000 dead, while later estimates of the figure were between 
  400 and 700. India had also alleged carpet bombing of Vadamaratchi. The Sri 
  Lankan government tried to make much of this. When foreign journalists were 
  flown later in by the government, they could see few signs of carpet bombing. 
  All this was to irk the Tamil people later when All India Radio would switch 
  from the exaggerations of May (with which the Tamils were happy) to obvious 
  untruths in the wake of India's own offensive in Jaffna later in October. One 
  consequence of India's vocal criticism of the Sri Lankan government's use of 
  air power, was that India was slow to admit its use of air power during its 
  offensive in October.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>During 1987, the Sri Lankan 
  use of air power had a deliberate vindictive purpose. Civilians were expected 
  to get killed. Its main effect was to keep the L.T.T.E. shifting houses. Still 
  most of the time, as FM conversations between airmen showed, its use was usually 
  restrained. The nature of the target was generally verified before action was 
  taken. By restraint, one means that those lucky enough not to live within 100 
  yards of an L.T.T.E. camp could consider themselves reasonably safe during air 
  raids. This did not apply to shelling. The element of discrimination was even 
  more vitiated when fertile minds in the national security ministry introduced 
  the Avro-dropped barrel bomb. </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>The L.T.T.E. was now facing 
  a crisis of prestige, as India was set to become top dog. After casting about 
  for an issue on which to build up support, it picked on G.C.E. A. Level examinations. 
  Its student wing, the S.A.L.T. wanted a boycott of A.Level examinations in July 
  for the reason that Vadamaratchi was in a bad way, with its education disrupted, 
  so that it was considered wrong for other Tamils to do their examinations unless 
  a postponement was granted. The S.A.L.T. leaders went about schools canvassing 
  the boycott. The response from boys' schools was of a noticeably low order in 
  comparison with that from girls' schools. Young men with a military bearing 
  led by Major Murali of the L.T.T.E. canvassing in schools brought about a flutter 
  of response in the girls' schools. Middle class girls were quite prominent in 
  the boycott movement.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>But the boycott move was unpopular 
  with the parents and a silent majority of the affected students. Many influential 
  persons with children who were A.Level candidates busily ran around canvassing 
  opinion and getting through to key L.T.T.E. leaders. Pressure was brought about 
  even from within the ranks of prominent L.T.T.E. supporters. The L.T.T.E. thought 
  it wise to backtrack.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>The boycott was ceremonially 
  called off. The L.T.T.E. was praised for its show of wisdom. Tamils from devastated 
  areas outside Jaffna wondered why there was no call to boycott when they had 
  been affected. Many girls had become enamoured of the L.T.T.E.. This remained 
  true. The role of girls in the L.T.T.E. had by now become significant. Several 
  were to die in action against the I.P.K.F. in October, including at least one 
  girl from Chundikuli Girls' College.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>One often finds amongst intelligent 
  middle class girls from English speaking homes, a reckless emotional drive to 
  serve a cause like that of the L.T.T.E.'s. Being very articulate speakers, they 
  bring in many village girls who are anxious to imitate them. But the middle 
  class girls soon get frustrated by fascist tendencies in the organisation. Many 
  of them develop problems of conscience and are unable to conform their independence 
  and initiative to the tastes of the organisation. Once the honeymoon is over, 
  many of these girls wish to leave. The parents quickly get into the act and 
  pack off the girl to stay with an aunt in Colombo so as to get over the trauma. 
  An S.O.S. would then be sent to a relative abroad to get her out. The girl would 
  then continue with her studies abroad and get over the past. But for the village 
  girls who get into the organisation under the influence of their middle class 
  peers, things work out tragically. They too may want to leave the organisation 
  for very much the same reasons. But they have nowhere to go. Their parents may 
  not have the means to help them. For them it requires a great deal of courage.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>On 25 June, the Indian ship 
  Srivastava, bringing relief supplies docked at K.K.S.. Crowds lined the route 
  taken by the Indian embassy officials Mr. Puri and Captain Gupta together with 
  the Indian Red Cross team, on their way to Jaffna. This resembled something 
  of a triumphal march. The L.T.T.E.'s position was a difficult one as the Indians 
  aimed directly for the people's affections. It tried to give the event a different 
  colour, by trying to behave as though it was the power in charge and was welcoming 
  Indian efforts as helping the L.T.T.E. to achieve its aims. It urged the crowd 
  to shout amongst other slogans, a request for arms. But the real feelings of 
  the crowd came out as people again and again broke down in front of the Indian 
  officials, saying simply, &quot;India save us.&quot;</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>On 5 July, the L.T.T.E. launched 
  a suicide attack against the Sri-Lankan army camp at Nelliady Central College. 
  The Sri Lankan army had reduced its strength in Vadamaratchi from 8000 to 3000 
  men. No one was expecting a major outbreak of violence. The government had agreed 
  to a ceasefire to facilitate the distribution of Indian relief supplies. The 
  L.T.T.E. was also understood to be a party to this. But as in the past both 
  sides could find excuses for not honouring ceasefires. The Sri Lankan S.T.F. 
  action in Batticaloa was as good as any. Earlier that day, armed L.T.T.E. men 
  were spotted at Nelliady and something had been expected. The entrance to Nelliady 
  Central College was located in a narrow road connecting Nelliady town with Vathiri 
  junction. Civilians were living just opposite the school and the army encouraged 
  the use of the road as a public relations exercise. Miller, a member of the 
  L.T.T.E.'s new black Tigers drove a van packed with explosives through the school 
  gates into the front building. The government claimed that 20 of its soldiers 
  died. Publicising its action through notice boards as a &quot;great achievement,&quot; 
  the L.T.T.E. claimed 100 soldiers killed. Other sources said that the government 
  figure was much nearer the truth. The army had been expecting something of this 
  nature, and what took place was not a major setback. Troops took up positions 
  and the Nelliady camp held out. What was surprising was the manner in which 
  the army reacted. The government had been keen to revive confidence in the people 
  and make Vadamaratchi a success. An elaborate public relations exercise was 
  going on. All this was shattered as the army let loose with a barrage of cannon 
  fire. Perhaps up to 20 civilians died in the shelling. Several others were shot 
  as they fled. In one incident at Navindil, a group of 12 elderly persons were 
  moving towards Udupiddy. When a round of shelling commenced they took shelter 
  in the porch of a house, which the owners had apparently fled. A group of soldiers 
  who arrived peeped through the window and observed that cooking had been going 
  on for a large party. The 12 persons were accused of feeding the L.T.T.E.. Despite 
  their denials, they were shot and pushed into the trench by soldiers of the 
  4th Division of the Gajaba Regiment Only the wife of a Singer company agent 
  escaped by feigning death. In another incident a shell falling on the Karaveddy 
  Roman Catholic Church killed 5 refugees. People were not taking chances this 
  time. An estimated 90% of the population fled Southwards as refugees. A few 
  remained close to the towns of Pt. Pedro, Udupiddy and Valvettithurai. Vadamaratchi 
  was described as a place for goats and stray dogs. The lack of clear policy 
  and army discipline demonstrated to India's advantage the Sri Lankan government's 
  limitations in making headway with solving the problem.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>With many people, the L.T.T.E. 
  had redeemed its reputation after running away in the face of Operation Liberation. 
  This again pointed to the fickleness of public opinion in Jaffna. In the rest 
  of Jaffna things went on as if nothing had happened. Refugee woes in newspapers 
  were part of the fare. To the L.T.T.E. it was a desultory achievement which 
  once again underlined its dependence on civilian cover. Once the civilians fled, 
  the L.T.T.E. found it difficult to stay on in Vadamaratchi. The L.T.T.E. withdrew 
  from Vadamaratchi on 13 July. On the same day a group of the notorious Black 
  Shirts, a unit of the Sri Lankan Army trained in Pakistan, moved from Polikandy 
  towards Navindil looking into houses and killing the aged who were left behind. 
  According to an engineer from that area, at least 20 persons, nearly all above 
  70, were shot dead.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>It may be assumed that India 
  had no foreknowledge of the L.T.T.E.'s attack on the night of 5th July. Indian 
  officials were critical. Members of the Indian Red Cross team were amongst those 
  trapped in Vadamaratchi. Reports at that time spoke of a heated argument within 
  the L.T.T.E. over whether its members in Vadamaratchi should be ordered to stay 
  or be withdrawn. With hardly any civilians left, it had become difficult to 
  remain there. If the event worked to the advantage of India, it was an unintended 
  consequence of the L.T.T.E.'s action, and the Sri Lankan army's ineptness in 
  dealing with civilians.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><b>8.2 The Accord, Colonisation and</b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><b><span> </span>Human Rights</b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><b><span style='font-size:11.0pt;letter-spacing:-.1pt'>The 
  process which began with the Indian airdrop on 4 June resulted in the Indo-Sri 
  Lanka accord of 29th July. The ideas contained in the deal envisaged for the 
  Tamils were similar to those put forward by the late Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's 
  special envoy G. Parthasarathy. The Northern and Eastern Provinces were to be 
  linked for a year with the permanency of the link to be decided by a referendum 
  in the East a year later. In the Eastern Province, the population was divided 
  into Tamils 42%, Muslims (also Tamil speaking) 34% and Sinhalese 24%. The last 
  group had come in mainly through colonisation over the last 40 years. According 
  to a senior official who worked for the first such scheme, the Gal Oya project, 
  in the 1940's, when the houses in the scheme were ready for occupation the first 
  offer was made to people in the locality. The official had gone about contacting 
  District Revenue Officers (or D.R.O.s) in and around Batticaloa calling for 
  volunteers. The response from the Tamils had been poor. Offers were then made 
  elsewhere and large numbers of Sinhalese came from areas such as Kegalle. Within 
  18 years they started paying income tax. At this point, the government of Ceylon 
  could not be blamed. But this set a pattern. Alarm bells started ringing when 
  politics acquired an increasingly chauvinistic note. Some of the worst violence 
  against Tamils, during the 1958 race riots, came from Sinhalese in the colonisation 
  schemes at Gal Oya and Padaviya. In the meantime movements to defend the Tamil 
  homeland had come into existence. Prominent amongst </span></b><span
style='font-size:9.0pt;letter-spacing:-.1pt'>the early leaders was the late Prof. 
  C. Suntheralingam, former Mathematics teacher at the Ceylon University, ex-Minister 
  and M.P. for the frontier electorate of Vavuniya. Together with the ideology 
  that Ceylon was for the majority Sinhalese had also arisen crusaders amongst 
  leading Sinhalese wanting to populate Tamil areas with Sinhalese. Government 
  policy too naturally veered in this direction. Attempts to settle the matter 
  through the Bandaranaike - Chelvanayakam pact of 1957 and the Dudley Senanayake 
  - Chelvanayakam pact of 1965 failed because of a lack of decision amongst the 
  two Prime Ministers resulting from pressure invoking the Sinhalese-Buddhist 
  ideology.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>The Buddhist clergy propagated 
  the ideology that Ceylon was a land sacred to the Buddha and the chosen repository 
  of his teachings. The chosen guardians were of course the Sinhalese people. 
  Professor Leslie Goonewardene (in &quot;<i>Ethnicity and Social Change in Sri 
  Lanka</i>,&quot; Social Scientists Association, 1979) argues that the term Sinhala 
  in the ancient chronicle Mahavamsa, actually referred to a particular dynasty 
  that was then favoured by the Buddhist clergy. The priestly chroniclers of the 
  4th century A.D. presented a version of history that attempted to justify through 
  reference to antiquity, a symbiotic relationship between themselves and a particular 
  dynasty. Over the coming centuries of migration from India, assimilation, comings, 
  goings, and transformation of both language and religion; the group of persons 
  referred to as Sinhala underwent changes according to the political ends to 
  which it was put to use. These ends were usually determined by the need to preserve 
  and advance the interests represented by the Buddhist Sangha. Ironically, the 
  allegedly chosen and exclusive group represented today by the term Sinhala is 
  made up to the extent of 40% by caste groups (Karawe, Durawe, Navandanno, and 
  Salagama) who trace their origins in South India to about 450 - 800 years back. 
  Although current popular Buddhism has assimilated and legitimised the religious 
  practices and cults of waves of migrants, the Sinhalese-Buddhist combination 
  today represents something aggressive and unpleasant. It seeks to drive minorities 
  to the wall. It was natural that the Buddhist clergy should form the vanguard 
  in the cause of populating Tamil areas with Sinhalese. Such activities had as 
  little to do with Buddhism as the Crusades with Christianity.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>By the early 1970's the Sinhalese 
  squatter townships of Sirimapura, Abhayapura, Mihindapura, and Pattispura had 
  come into existence in Trincomalee. These became a major irritant to the Tamils 
  during the race riots of 1977 and during and after July 1983. From 1977 government 
  ministries used their facilities to provide employment for Sinhalese in Trincomalee. 
  Prominent amongst such ministers were Cyril Mathew (Scientific Affairs and Industries) 
  and Gamini Dissanayake (Lands, Irrigation and Power). From 1983, colonisation 
  acquired a more terrifying aspect. Many shops in Trincomalee town were taken 
  over after the Tamil owners had been driven out. The same thing was being done 
  to houses and lands. The law and order machinery for redress was spiked as far 
  as the Tamils went. From 1985, the army was used in large scale evictions of 
  Tamils. Scenes of unbelievable devastation are still evident as one drives into 
  Trincomalee through Pankulam, Anuradhapura junction and Uppuveli. Things were 
  not helped when Mr. Lalith Athulathmudali, the National Security Minister, announced 
  in Parliament in December 1984 that the government was hoping, in a move towards 
  finding a solution to the ethnic problem, to settle a large number of Sinhalese 
  in the Tamil areas. Many of the prospective settlers were to be drawn from fishermen 
  and ex-convicts. To this period may be traced the first attacks on Sinhalese 
  settlers by Tamil militants.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>Tamil - Muslim relations in 
  the Batticaloa district had been fairly good. The evidence of many Western journalists 
  describes how the government fomented trouble between Tamils and Muslims in 
  Batticaloa as a measure to contain the Tamil insurgency.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>The foregoing digression briefly 
  describes how complex and anarchic the problems of the East had become. The 
  Tamils felt cheated. There were now many Sinhalese who regarded the East as 
  their home. The Muslims were confused and in a quandary. The actions of the 
  government had made it easier for the Tamils, in their minds, to condone attacks 
  on the Sinhalese civilian population which was regarded as an ultra-military 
  arm of government policy. The bitter experience through which some of the Tamil 
  militant leaders were born has been alluded to earlier. The East had changed 
  qualitatively from the time of Parthasarathy's visits in 1983.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>The East was the weak link 
  in the Accord of July 1987. On the surface, the position on the North-East linkage 
  seemed a compromise between Tamil and Sinhalese positions, aimed at providing 
  the L.T.T.E. with a face saving formula to accept the Accord. Though perhaps 
  well meaning, the Indian negotiators do not seem to have paid much attention 
  to the complexities of the East. Many leading Tamils would have preferred the 
  North and East to have separate provincial councils. They felt that the Tamils, 
  Sinhalese, and the Muslims of the East had to live with each other and left 
  to themselves, would find the most rational basis on which to co-exist. The 
  Muslims of the East had already expressed a desire to go a separate way from 
  the Muslims of the Western seaboard. They recognised that they had different 
  interests. One senior Tamil civil servant pointed out that for reasons of economic 
  self-interest at least, the Sinhalese in the East will have a vested interest 
  in stopping further Sinhalese colonisation. But if the Tamils of the North, 
  particularly from Jaffna, were to have a commanding voice in the East, the Eastern 
  Tamils may tend to gang up with them against the Muslims, who in turn would 
  tend to gang up with the Sinhalese against the Tamils. The resulting instability 
  may then provide the centre with room to interfere.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>Substantive issues such as 
  colonisation were left as a matter for further talks. There was also a referendum 
  hanging over the East which would decide the fate of the linkage in a year's 
  time. If all parties were to act cynically in terms of their perceived interests, 
  the government would try to push Sinhalese colonisation in the East surreptitiously 
  using its machinery and would try to sour relations between Muslims and Tamils; 
  and the Tamil militants would try to create conditions which would pave the 
  way for a mass exodus of Sinhalese. To some extent all these happened. The Accord 
  provided for the presence in the North and East of an Indian Peace Keeping Force 
  (I.P.K.F.) to ensure its implementation. Some role for such a force was necessary.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>There were two key factors 
  that placed the Accord on a weak footing. First, it did not provide for a mechanism 
  to correct human rights violations. Thus it also ignored the primacy of reaching 
  a democratic consensus. In time, the Accord tended to look more and more like 
  a strait-jacket imposed on the people of the island. In the months that followed 
  the Accord, the Indian Army in the Tamil areas and the Sri Lankan forces in 
  the South, would be led to seeking political solutions through military means 
  that involved gross violations of human rights, making a political solution 
  even more unattainable. (See sections 8, 9 and 10.4 of Volume 2).</p>
<p><span> </span>The second factor that weakened the Accord, is 
  related to the first. It is the question of whether President Jayewardene enjoyed 
  the legitimacy to negotiate with India on such an important matter. In answering 
  this, one is left with little doubt, if one looks at the growing repression 
  over the past ten years, and the methods used to perpetuate power, such as regular 
  constitutional changes and the 1982 referendum.</p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center;'><b>8.3 The end of a Long Road to 
  Nowhere </b></p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center;'><b><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;'>As for the Sinhalese people, it finally began to dawn 
  on them that they had been on a long road to nowhere. With them doubts gave 
  way to euphoria with the successful launching of Operation Liberation. This 
  reached a peak when the fishing vessels carrying the Indian Red Cross meekly 
  turned back. Sabre rattling statements by senior politicians and newspaper columnists 
  were the order of the day. With the Indian airdrop of relief supplies, euphoria 
  gave way to indignation, followed by a long hangover during which doubts re-emerged. 
  It was perhaps easier for a Sinhalese living outside Ceylon to see the unreality 
  of the government's approach in the light of how dangerously out of tune they 
  were with the rest of the world. In contrast the Tamils generally felt that 
  it was a great thing to gain international sympathy by hook or by crook, without 
  themselves doing anything positive in the meantime.</span></b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>We quote below an extract 
  from an article which appeared in the Weekend of 19 July 1987 giving some reflections 
  on the 4th anniversary of the 1983 race riots. The article &quot;Still at square 
  one four years after?&quot; by Kumudini Hettiaratchchi is made all the more 
  remarkable by its having appeared in the Weekend:</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><i><span
style='font-size:9.0pt;letter-spacing:-.1pt'>Mea culpas</span></i><span style='font-size:9.0pt;letter-spacing:-.1pt'> 
  during the last four years have been of no avail. What positive action has been 
  taken to redeem this country's image to what it was before the debacle? The 
  Sri Lankans had been thought of as a nation of peaceful and tolerant people 
  comprising a multiracial and multi-religious community. The recent developments, 
  not only in the regional scene but also in the international sphere regarding 
  the ethnic crisis, create serious doubts as to whether we have been successful 
  in retrieving our lost image.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>What does the world think 
  of Sri Lanka today? Has the government campaign to propagate the truth of the 
  real position been a success? Have we been able to impress the world that in 
  the stand taken by the majority community in the country we have held up the 
  ideal that in the relationships between the various communities, particularly 
  the Tamils, the virtue of justice and not that of charity should be the foundation 
  and the norm?</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>&quot;Recently, I had the 
  opportunity of meeting and discussing our ethnic problem with a number of persons 
  in the United Kingdom. Those who made observations belonged to different nationalities. 
  The general opinion was vacillating between a military solution and a political 
  settlement. On several occasions I was asked whether Sri Lanka was interested 
  in settling the ethnic conflict once and for all.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>&quot;In fact there is a very 
  serious misconception among some of the people there that we are thinking of 
  ourselves as a chosen people. It was tragic that some experienced and senior 
  journalists there too had formed the impression that the ethnic conflict in 
  Sri Lanka would never be settled because of diehard attitudes. It is a tragedy 
  that even though the world community was initially shocked by the Pettah bomb 
  blast, which killed over 100 innocent persons and injured several hundred others, 
  the inexcusable slaying of 30 Buddhist monks and the brutal murders of numbers 
  of harmless villagers in Arantalawa and other areas in the North and the East, 
  every country in the world had reiterated that the Sri Lanka should go in only 
  for a political solution to the ethnic problem.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>&quot;In the present perspective 
  Operation Liberation was regarded by them as an 'ill-advised move.' Instead 
  of helping the country regain some of its lost reputation for loving peaceful 
  methods of settling disputes, it seemed to have created the impression that 
  Sri Lanka was only paying lip service to a 'political solution.'&quot;</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>&quot;The offensive, it appears, 
  had pushed this country further into the abyss of isolation among the comity 
  of nations. Several journalists and others in the United Kingdom were generally 
  &quot;cold&quot; towards even the violation of Sri Lanka's airspace by India 
  dropping food aid from in planes escorted by Mirage Fighters. The &quot;mercy 
  mission&quot; violation of Sri Lankan territorial integrity by India was not 
  condemned as it should have been by the West. It was only mildly deplored as 
  it were by the European Parliament. A family that I knew in Oxford expressed 
  horror at what they had seen on a programme on British television three weeks 
  previously. &quot;How could the Sinhalese be so brutal?,&quot; the materfamilias 
  asked me. The man of the house was adamant that there had been &quot;firebombings&quot; 
  in the North. &quot;What of the children shown with severe burns?&quot; he asked. 
  &quot;Who is responsible for ordering Vietnam tactics in your country?&quot; 
  he asked me in the presence of several journalists from a number of countries, 
  he had invited for supper.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>&quot;A journalist listening 
  in on our conversation laughingly quoted, &quot;Where every prospect pleases 
  and only man is vile&quot; about Sri Lanka. In Britain it was also difficult 
  to explain the &quot;arbitrary arrests&quot; and the alleged &quot;disappearances&quot; 
  of some of those arrested.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>When one compares the protest 
  from the international community in the case of Afghanistan, Grenada and earlier 
  Kampuchea, not to mention the Nicaraguan crisis, with our own ethnic debacle, 
  one comes to the inescapable conclusion that there had to be serious rethinking 
  on the absolute necessity for an early settlement.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span> </span>But the most important and essential 
  ingredient for peace, is honesty and sincerity.&quot;</p>
