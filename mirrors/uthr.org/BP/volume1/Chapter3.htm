<p align=center style='text-align:center;'><b><a name="top"></a>AUGUST 1981 TO 
  JULY 1983</b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><b>3.1       Introductions56                              </b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'>Going by the advice of the mediators, the T.U.L.F. 
  had staked much on the success of the D.D.C.s. It had also persuaded a large 
  section of the militant movement to back the D.D.C. proposals. The government's 
  failure to deal honestly in this matter and on the other hand its own pursuit 
  of terror against Tamils were to create a rapidly deteriorating situation between 
  November 1982 and July 1983. It is an irony of Ceylonese politics that the T.U.L.F. 
  and the C.W.C., representing Plantation Tamils and under Thondaman, should look 
  upon the main author of present problems, the U.N.P., as offering the best of 
  solutions. In this vain hope the T.U.L.F. remained silent waiting for the goods. 
  The groundswell of Tamil opinion would not have tolerated the T.U.L.F. backing 
  the U.N.P. in the Presidential elections in October 1982 and in the referendum. 
  By calculatedly not taking a stand, the T.U.L.F. helped Jayewardene's U.N.P. 
  to win both the Presidential elections and the referendum which was in any case 
  won by widespread cheating. At the end of a series of broken promises, the U.N.P. 
  pleaded once again that to keep its hitherto unhonoured promises to the Tamils 
  it needed to win both elections and retain its parliamentary majority. The referendum 
  which took place in December 1982 was in effect an undemocratic exercise depriving 
  the people of this country of their right to choose their representatives. The 
  excuse for this was that the government had discovered an undisclosed Naxalite<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span> 
  [1] </span></a><sup>1</sup> plot. For this service to the U.N.P. in helping 
  it to deprive the people of this country of their right to elect, the T.U.L.F. 
  and the C.W.C. were rewarded with the July 1983 race riots followed by the sixth 
  amendment expelling the T.U.L.F. from parliament. The C.W.C. was saved by its 
  control over labour in a crucial sector of the economy as well as by India's 
  entry into the affairs of this country. For a political party, to lose its combativeness 
  and remain passive amounts to suicide. This was the fate of the T.U.L.F.. In 
  many ways the challenge facing the Sinhalese in the South with the rapid rise 
  of the J.V.P. in 1987 would have close parallels with the experience of the 
  Tamils after 1977 -- particularly during the period under consideration.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span>      </span>While the T.U.L.F. was waiting 
  in vain, every new issue brought forth a spontaneous outpouring of public spirit, 
  led by the university students. These protests were non-violent and were often 
  against actions of the government under the P.T.A.. The spontaneous character 
  of these protests was different in quality from the stage managed affairs of 
  the militant groups after 1985. The militant groups did benefit from the activities 
  of the students before July 1983 and there was widespread public sympathy for 
  the militants as &quot;our boys&quot;. But those with a base, such as within 
  the student community, could and did criticise the actions of the militants. 
  The militants too had to take serious note of such criticism. Many observers 
  feel that if this trend had continued, there would have been a militant movement 
  accountable to the public and, therefore, amenable to public control. The July 
  1983 riots and the adoption by India of the militant groups changed all this. 
  With material help from India, the militant groups became purely military organisations, 
  accountable to the R.A.W. and not to the Tamil public. The latter became everyone's 
  plaything.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span>      </span>There have always been those 
  who argue that to build up resentment by provoking the worse instincts of the 
  state is good for revolutionary fervour. But the misery, suffering, fanaticism 
  and hysteria let loose by such a course on both sides of the division can hardly 
  encourage democracy and freedom for those who survive. This appears to be a 
  lesson ill-digested by the Tamils whose tragedy the South seems set to re-live. 
  The failure of the community to clarify the moral issues would ultimately have 
  a corrupting influence on the young who dedicated themselves to freedom.</p>

  Review</b></p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center;'><b>What follows will be a run through 
  the main events of this period as recorded by the Saturday Review, a weekly 
  published in Jaffna. The title dates refer to the date of publication. It is

  in Jaffna during this period, punctuated by doubt and foreboding.</b></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='letter-spacing:-.1pt'>&quot;Undergraduates 
  and students in the North and East boycotted lectures and classes yesterday 
  (14 May) to protest the continued detention without trial, of Jaffna University 
  undergraduate Apputhurai Vimalarasa for over a year at the Panagoda Army Camp. 
  The undergraduates in the University of Colombo too joined in the protest by 
  boycotting lectures in the afternoon while telegrams asking for the release 
  of Vimalarasa have been sent to President J. R. Jayewardene by undergraduates 
  of the other Universities.&quot;</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span>      </span>Students distributing leaflets 
  in connection with this protest were arrested by the police in all Tamil districts. 
  On 17th May the undergraduates organised a massive demonstration in Jaffna defying 
  a police ban.</p>

<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='letter-spacing:-.1pt'>Under the front 
  page headlines &quot;Jaffna violence takes on a new ugly dimension&quot;, the 
  Saturday Review reported the first well-publicised political killings: &quot;Political 
  youth violence which began seven years ago with the killing of the then pro-government 
  Mayor Alfred Duraiyappah on 27 July, 1975, has been following a predictable 
  course ever since, assumed a new dimension on Wednesday 26th May when a popular 
  social worker and a Tamil liberation activist, P. Iraikumaran (27) was gunned 
  down along with his friend T. Umakumaran (28) at Alaveddy, by a gang of seven 
  youths. Alaveddy, a village about ten miles from Jaffna town is in the Kankesanthurai 
  constituency represented by Tamil United Liberation Front leader A. Amirthalingam.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span>      </span>&quot;Iraikumaran, a Cultivation 
  Officer, was the Organising Secretary of the Thamil Ilaignar Peravai Viduthalai 
  Ani (Tamil Youth Front Liberation Wing). He had previously been a member of 
  the youth front aligned with the T.U.L.F. and had edited a pro-T.U.L.F. paper 
  Ilaignar Kural (The Voice of the Youth) in 1976.&quot; Iraikumaran had been 
  a critic of the T.U.L.F.'s after breaking away from the party when it accepted 
  the D.D.C.s. Other sources confirmed later that militants aligned with Uma Maheswaran 
  were responsible for the killings. One killing began as a misadventure. The 
  other followed as a cover up. The Saturday Review had neglected to commit itself 
  to its readers on whether or not the &quot;new dimension&quot; was part of the 
  &quot;predictable course&quot;. These were still the early days of internecine 
  killings. Press-men did not yet find themselves writing under duress. The Saturday 
  Review published a powerful editorial in the same issue:</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='letter-spacing:-.1pt'>&quot;The political 
  heat, denied an external outlet, is turning inwards now. Violence of course 
  is at all times destructive, but violence is now changing direction. It is becoming 
  self-destructive. In fact there is a new terrifying chill in the political wind. 
  The air is getting hotter with a new political intolerance. Brother is turning 
  against brother; guns taught to shoot at targets, find that the targets are 
  no longer there. A society which learnt to put up with killings, by looking 
  over its shoulder and recognising a goal at a distance thought there was a thing 
  called justifiable homicide, as in law. Now they don't see the goal anymore. 
  It has been politically vitiated...</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span>      </span>&quot;The killing of Iraikumaran 
  and Umakumaran, as we see it is more than mere killings: it is more than terrorism. 
  It shows all the portents of a new ugly face in the Tamil man's political life. 
  A society, bereft of a rationale for homicide, is now turning to suicide...</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span>      </span>&quot;The truth is that there 
  is a new underground force in the making, an underground force without ideals, 
  which if allowed unchecked could even bring about a state of civil strife in 
  Jaffna, and plunge the whole peninsula into chaos. This has to be nipped in 
  the bud, and if there is one leader who has sufficient weight and authority 
  to do this, it is Mr. Amirthalingam.&quot;</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span>      </span>There was to be civil strife 
  which reached a feverish height with the L.T.T.E.-T.E.L.O. clash in late April 
  1986, 47 months later. There was a state of prolonged chaos. When this happened 
  there was no dilemma for the editorial writers of the Saturday Review, or for 
  any other journal in Jaffna. If they did not take a holiday, as they did, they 
  would have been regarded as mad men &quot;turning to suicide&quot;. The new 
  forces were not without ideals. In the case of the L.T.T.E. these ideals had 
  the character of religious devotion. But these had little to do with Liberty, 
  Fraternity, and Equality.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span>      </span>The editorial writer quoted 
  above reflects the popular attitude to violence amongst Jaffna men. They would 
  maintain that they did not like violence, except that it was sometimes necessary. 
  They would personally avoid killing. Except for medical men and scientists working 
  on vivisection, those involved with killing, such as butchers and dog catchers, 
  were categorised as being from so called low caste groups, as in Sir Thomas 
  More's <i>Utopia</i>. (Thomas More knew little about India, which makes his 
  ideas all the more remarkable.) They had the authority of the <i>Mahabharata</i>, 
  where the men who killed in battle were regarded as a caste group - namely the 
  Kshatriyas. Even as the militant groups grew in strength and despite the talk 
  of &quot;our boys&quot;, for the upper reaches of Tamil society they remained 
  essentially an alien caste group. The elite, both locally and abroad, who provided 
  material and moral support for the militants, could frequently be heard saying 
  unashamedly, sometimes referring to the Mahabharata, that it may be the business 
  of the fighters to obtain freedom; but the business of ruling, however, must 
  be in the hands of those who are wise and educated. The latter often meant the 
  sons of the elite who were abroad. The militants of course were aware of this 
  and for many of those who had sacrificed successful careers at school, this 
  was hard to bear. Thus the Jaffna man's ambivalence towards violence also extended 
  to an ambivalence towards the militants, who in turn felt that others were trying 
  to use them. This may partly explain the cynicism and hatred of the L.T.T.E. 
  towards the civilian population which reached new heights in 1987. The editorial 
  writer, like everyone else, was moved to questioning and doubting over the two 
  killings in May 1982. Yet, like others, he avoided answering the question whether 
  there was a rationale for homicide that does not lead to suicide. Note also 
  the hope reposed on Amirthalingam in a dark moment.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span>      </span>The Saturday Review of 5 June, 
  1982 said that following the mass protests, Vimalarasa who was not tried for 
  over a year, was brought before the Court of Appeal by the army authorities 
  on Monday, 31 May. A bench consisting of Justices Seneviratne and Abeyawardene 
  gave time till 19 July for the State to file affidavits and fixed the trial 
  for 26 July.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span>      </span>The issue of 12 June announced 
  that Vimalarasa and nine other detainees had been released on 7 June, two days 
  before the T.U.L.F. leader Mr. Amirthalingam was to meet President Jayewardene 
  on the matter. The paper speculated that this move to steal the wind from Amirthalingam's 
  sails may have been in order to woo the Tamils directly before the President's 
  first official visit to Jaffna. Another probable reason was that having been 
  pressurised into going to Court, the government may have discovered that its 
  case was weak. This was often the case with arrests under the P.T.A.. This victory 
  gave the students a new prestige.</p>

<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='letter-spacing:-.1pt'>Under the heading 
  Tiger File, The Saturday Review reported the incident which heralded India's 
  role in this country's affairs. It quoted the Indian Express of 21 May, which 
  reported the incident of the 19th at Pondi Bazaar on its front page: &quot;According 
  to the police, there was a confrontation between two groups, and in the process, 
  Prabhakaran (28) alias Karikalan and Sivakumar (24) alias Raghavan opened fire 
  with unlicensed revolvers on Mukundan (Uma Maheswaran) and Jotheeswaran (22). 
  Jotheeswaran sustained four bullet injuries in his leg and was admitted to the 
  Rayapettah hospital. Mukundan escaped in the melee. On hearing gun-shots, Deputy 
  Inspector Nandakumar of the Pondy Bazaar Crime Detachment rushed to the spot 
  with his staff and arrested the culprits.&quot;</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span>      </span>The Saturday Review further 
  added that Uma Maheswaran who had got away on his motorcycle was captured after 
  a massive police search at a railway station on 25 May. Two revolvers and a 
  vial of cyanide were found on his person. The incident represented the bitter 
  split between the Liberation Tigers and P.L.O.T.E. that was now surfacing openly. 
  Many Tamil Nadu politicians and lawyers got into the act trying to patch up 
  the split. The militants went along expressing regret over the incident together 
  with a desire for unity. The PTI quoted both parties as feeling that continued 
  disunity between them could only jeopardise their real object of achieving Tamil 
  Eelam. Uma Maheswaran who had been a surveyor by profession, expressed appreciation 
  for the way the Tamil Nadu police had treated them. When he required some books 
  on surveying, the Tamil Nadu police had brought them to him after a prolonged 
  search in several bookshops. It all looked homely enough. &quot;Boys will be 
  boys. They will shake hands and be friendly in the interests of a higher cause,&quot; 
  was the general feeling around. The Saturday Review reflected the public view 
  in expressing a hint of satisfaction that powerful attempts at obtaining extradition 
  by the Sri Lankan government were failing. It quoted the SUN's front page headline: 
  &quot;TAMIL NADU POLITICOS GIVE PATRONAGE TO TIGERS: TREMENDOUS FINANCIAL BACKING 
  AND 'SAFE HOUSE': M.G.R.'s life too threatened by terrorists&quot;. That was 
  six years ago. The naive belief that the central government in India was bowing 
  to Tamil Nadu pressure seemed a satisfactory explanation to both sides in Ceylon. 
  We all lived in a cynical world where everyone thought he could cleverly use 
  the other to get his own ends. Many Tamils thought they could use India to get 
  Eelam. Who was master of the game would emerge much later. But for the moment 
  all eyes were on the two boys - both makers and victims of history. We could 
  thumb our noses at the Sinhalese. It was a time for some rejoicing. Tomorrow 
  would take care of itself.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><b><span
style='letter-spacing:-.1pt'>12 June, 1982:</span></b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='letter-spacing:-.1pt'>An excerpt from 
  an appreciation to the late Bishop Leo Nanayakkara by P. Arulanantham reads 
  thus: &quot;In 1973-75 there were many destitutes on the streets of Badulle, 
  most of whom were persons displaced from the tea estates. Bishop Leo was the 
  organiser behind the organisation of the Beggar Rehabilitation Camp, with the 
  help of official and private bodies who were willing to help. He was a practical 
  man. Bishop Leo was a champion of the oppressed. He studied the problem of insurgents 
  taken into captivity in 1971 and took practical measures to help them. He consistently 
  expressed the view that the Tamils and the Tamil language should enjoy equal 
  rights in this country.&quot;</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><b><span
style='letter-spacing:-.1pt'>3 July, 1982</span></b><span style='letter-spacing:

<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='letter-spacing:-.1pt'>&quot;Three 
  policemen and a Police driver were shot to death by unknown gunmen who ambushed 
  a Police jeep at Nelliady junction in the Point Pedro area, Jaffna, at about 
  7:30 p.m. on Friday the night of July 2. The dead policemen were Gunapala, Arunthavarajah, 
  Mallawaratchi and Ariyaratne (driver). The O.I.C., Point Pedro, Inspector I. 
  Thiruchittampalam and Constables Sivarajah and Ananda were admitted to Jaffna 
  hospital with injuries. The assailants are believed to have escaped in a passing 
  car.&quot;</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span>      </span>The editorial commented: &quot;If 
  the killed are those who become victims of circumstances, the killers are themselves 
  victims of circumstances. If a government cannot find ways to stop creating 
  and fostering these circumstances, that government had failed in its duty by 
  <i>all </i>its citizens.&quot;</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span>      </span>That was obviously true. Most 
  Tamils then thought that such sentiments represented the end of the matter as 
  far as they were concerned. Then again they were depending on a provenly undependable 
  government to wake up and deliver the goods, thus being party to the drift.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span>      </span>The issue of 18 September in 
  its lead story stated that the General Council of the T.U.L.F. was likely to 
  take a decision that would enable the Tamils to keep away from the Presidential 
  elections altogether. The issue of 25 September gave an instance of the kind 
  of interference with the process of the law by the government that increasingly 
  made Tamils sympathise with militants.</p>

<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='letter-spacing:-.1pt'>The following 
  is an exerpt from an article by Dayan Jayatilleke on the J.V.P.'s stand on the 
  National Question (the Tamil - Sinhalese division). The J.V.P. (Peoples' Liberation 
  Front) leader Rohana Wijeweera was one of the contestants of the Presidential 
  Elections: &quot;He (Wijeweera in a public speech) accused the U.N.P. government 
  of sending 'innocent' police and military men to their deaths. He also accuses 
  the S.L.F.P. of promising Swaraj (Own Rule) through its spokesman K. B. Ratnayake, 
  to the Tamils... Comrade Wijeweera also proceeds in the course of his masterly 
  analysis of the National Question, to provide his audience with the doubtless 
  useful and very relevant data that five top police officers are Tamils. In fact 
  he is kind enough to provide his young Sinhalese audience with their names in 
  what he fondly supposes is a Tamil accent. Rohana's boast that his is the only 
  party to hold meetings in the North, is in the same spirit as that of a gangster 
  who boasts that he and his boys were tough enough to go into the North side 
  of the town, i.e. territory controlled by another gang, and return in one piece. 
  In other words he is telling his constituency that it is he and his party, rather 
  than the U.N.P. and S.L.F.P., that are tough enough to deal with the Eelam threat.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='letter-spacing:-.1pt'>The Saturday 
  Review reported an attack by a militant group on a police station. The group 
  was later identified as the L.T.T.E. (Tigers): &quot;Three policemen on duty 
  at Chavakachcheri Police Station were shot dead in a lightning dawn attack by 
  a party of armed youth on Wednesday, October 27th. About 12 hours later the 
  Police imposed an instant 12 hour curfew from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. in the Jaffna 
  district creating panic and confusion among the public. Guns and ammunition 
  were also stolen at the Police Station along with some files. The weapons consisted 
  of two sub-machine guns, nine rifles, 19 repeater guns and two shot guns. The 
  dead men are P.C. Kandiah of Mirusuvil, P. C. Karunanadan of Uduvil and P. C. 
  Tillekeratne of Kegalle. A remand suspect in a murder case who happened to be 
  under lock-up at the Police Station, Kandiah Selvam, also died in the cross 
  fire.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span>      </span>&quot;P. C. Jayatilleke who 
  had jumped down from the upper storey of the Police Station was injured by the 
  fall. He had been admitted to the Jaffna General Hospital along with Sergeant 
  Kandiah who suffered gunshot injuries. Two more remand prisoners, Karthigesu 
  and Aiyathurai were also wounded. It is believed that there was an exchange 
  of fire for about 15 minutes... It is believed that two of the youths have been 
  injured and that one of them could have died. Army personnel who went to Chavakachcheri 
  after the attack discovered spent cartridges and unexploded bullets.&quot;</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span>      </span>Papers in the South added that 
  the attackers had to leave abruptly as one of the policemen took up a hidden 
  position and started sniping at the attackers. </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span>      </span>The security forces in the North 
  had not yet been brutalised to a point where their reflex action would be to 
  go about on a rampage killing prisoners and civilians at random.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span>      </span>The same issue of the Saturday 
  Review announced in its lead story that, having won the presidential elections 
  (J. R. Jayewardene, U.N.P., 52.91%; Hector Kobbekaduwa, S.L.F.P., 39.07%. Mrs. 
  Bandaranaike was prevented from appearing or canvassing for the SLFP because 
  of a questionable suspension of her civic rights.), the government was planning 
  to hold a referendum in order to extend the life of the parliament by six years. 
  The referendum to be held before Christmas would seek a simple yes or no from 
  the voters. This surprise move came at a time when the country at large was 
  expecting general elections to elect a new parliament. The move was deceitfully 
  packaged to attract the support of Tamils who had been repeatedly tricked. The 
  story went: &quot;Speculation is rife in Jaffna that the T.U.L.F. leader, Mr. 
  Appapillai Amirthalingam, may be offered high office in the Government that 
  would eventually lead to the formation of a National Government in the country... 
  Certain constitutional changes that require a two-thirds majority are believed 
  to be under contemplation that would facilitate this process. The holding of 
  a referendum seeking the extension of the life of the parliament by six years 
  from August 1983 and a complete revamping of the Cabinet and Parliamentary Group 
  are believed to be steps that will help in this direction... It is believed 
  that such a government that will cut through party differences and draw in talent 
  from non-U.N.P. sources could not only help in the continuity of the government's 
  economic programme but solve the vexing 'TAMIL PROBLEM' as well.&quot;</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span>      </span>Thus the government which had 
  repeatedly dishonoured its word to the Tamils was now inviting the Tamils to 
  trust it once more in order to cheat the entire country of their right to elect.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span>      </span>The paper was soon undeceived 
  as it started publishing protests from all over the country. The Civil Rights 
  Movement (C.R.M.) in three statements referred to the &quot;dangerous and unprecedented 
  nature of this step which threatened the very basis of democratic parliamentary 
  government founded on periodic elections of the people's representatives.&quot; 
  It pointed out that &quot;the move was in breach of Sri Lanka's obligations 
  under the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights.&quot; Ceylon 
  had only the previous year celebrated 50 years of universal adult franchise.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span>      </span>R. P. Wijeratne writing from 
  Colombo said: &quot;The bizarre spectacle of honourable ministers and M.P.'s 
  of the governing party being submitted <i>en masse</i> to the indignity of handing 
  over undated letters of resignation to their leader is further evidence of this 
  kind of cynicism. Apart from the mutual distrust revealed by these arrangements, 
  the complete surrender of wills and independence by representatives elected 
  by the people, to a leader however estimable, will certainly not enhance their 
  prestige and standing in the eyes of the people.&quot;</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span>      </span>In a telegram to the President, 
  the C.R.M. pointed out that the referendum was neither free nor fair, because 
  an emergency was in force, under which several opposition newspapers (including 
  Aththa) had been prevented from publication and had had their presses sealed. 
</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span>      </span>In a letter signed on behalf 
  of the M.I.R.J.E. (Movement for Inter Racial Justice and Equality) by its president 
  Fr. Paul Caspersz, a doughty fighter for minority rights, an appeal was made 
  to the T.U.L.F.. It was asked to refrain from being drawn into discussions with 
  the government on the national question until the conclusion of the referendum 
  and to participate actively in a campaign for the preservation of the fundamental 
  rights of the people to elect their own M.P.'s. It further deplored efforts 
  at that juncture by the government to place before Tamil-speaking people, token 
  concessions as solutions to their problems and considered such overtones opportunistic 
  and intended to compel the T.U.L.F. to soft-pedal its campaign against the Government's 
  proposal at the referendum. </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span>      </span>This provided an opportune moment 
  for the T.U.L.F. to take up a principled stand and resume its combative role. 
  A principled stand could have meant only one thing - totally to oppose the fraud 
  the government was trying to inflict on the entire country. This would have 
  given both the Tamils and the T.U.L.F. a new prestige countrywide. Mr. Amirthalingam 
  could be combative when he wished to. But since the late 1970's the party organisation 
  had been in a deeply frozen state, with the younger elements slipping away into 
  militant ranks. When the matter of the referendum was brought before parliament, 
  the T.U.L.F. showed its lukewarmness by speaking against it while at the same 
  time not registering a single protest vote. The same puzzling attitude was displayed 
  by the T.U.L.F. during the general strike of mid-1980, which the government 
  put down with large-scale repression. In support of the strikers, university 
  members, teachers and trade unionists organised a one-day hartal and march in 
  Jaffna. The T.U.L.F. declined to join. When questioned, a very senior T.U.L.F. 
  member replied that the matter was a &quot;Southern problem&quot;. Here was 
  a classic instance of divide and rule. The T.U.L.F. had voluntarily submitted 
  the Tamils to ghetto politics, when with a little vision it could have enhanced 
  respect for the Tamils. The government kept the T.U.L.F. quiet by means of a 
  few perks for parliamentarians and the promise of &quot;jam tomorrow&quot; for 
  the Tamils. But as in that famous song &quot;Tomorrow never comes&quot;, the 
  result was a dangerous isolation of the Tamils, putting them entirely at the 
  mercy of the government. The T.U.L.F. is a product of Tamil society. The preoccupation 
  of its elite has not been with doing the right thing or the principled thing, 
  but with doing what seems clever and convenient. Thus at that time (1988) when 
  people should have been trying to restore democracy by forging links with all 
  democratic sections in the South and by improving Sinhalese-Tamil relations, 
  they seem to have been holding onto another will-o-the-wisp. The only idea coming 
  from the Tamil elite today was a plea to India to negotiate with the L.T.T.E. 
  - meaning, give them (the L.T.T.E.) something so that they would be left alone. 
  As an eminent public man put it in words that cannot mean anything: &quot;The 
  Tigers and the Indian Army are our two precious eyes. We cannot be without either 
  one of them.&quot; This is the counterpart of the T.U.L.F.'s stand in the early 
  1980's. </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><b><span

<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='letter-spacing:-.1pt'>The Saturday 
  Review quoted a press report, according to which President Jayewardene told 
  his District Ministers that he had an assurance from the T.U.L.F. leadership 
  that it would not actively canvass against the referendum. The Saturday Review 
  further said: &quot;An interview the Secretary General of the T.U.L.F. (Tamil 
  United Liberation Front) and Leader of the Opposition, Mr. A. Amirthalingam, 
  gave a Colombo week-end paper recently fuelled speculation that the T.U.L.F. 
  leader may be offered high office in a &quot;National Government&quot; as forecast 
  by the Saturday Review in its issue of 23 October.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='letter-spacing:-.1pt'>&quot;Mr. Amirthalingam 
  made it quite clear, in the course of the interview, that the T.U.L.F. will 
  not boycott Parliament nor join any so called 'common front' in campaigning 
  against the referendum.&quot; Mr. Amirthalingam further added: &quot;Even if 
  the Government carries the referendum through, we will remain in Parliament 
  until August 3, 1983 when this term runs out. At this point the General Council 
  will decide as to who should represent the T.U.L.F. in parliament for the extended 
  period.&quot;</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span>      </span>Thus it appeared to the T.U.L.F. 
  leadership that it could imitate the undemocratic example set by President Jayewardene, 
  who had obtained undated letters of resignation from his parliamentary group 
  to set up a tame parliament after the referendum. It seemed a bargain to the 
  T.U.L.F. -- the price was for it to remain non-committal. To be doubly sure, 
  the government did some arm twisting as well. The same issue reported that the 
  Government had ordered its officers in the North and East to turn down all requests 
  by T.U.L.F. M.P.s - the small mercies afforded to keep them in hope: &quot;Education 
  authorities in the North and East were summoned to Colombo to be told bluntly 
  not to oblige the T.U.L.F. M.P.'s requests for transfers and appointments... 
  Meanwhile the appointments of 15 bank employees recommended by the T.U.L.F. 
  M.P. for Vavuniya, Mr. T. Sivasithamparam, have been cancelled.&quot; All requests 
  to the Education authorities were to be reported to the head office in Colombo, 
  so that M.P.s wanting favours would have to go to the government directly.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span>      </span>Looking back one can hardly 
  understand why the T.U.L.F. subjected itself and the Tamils to this loss of 
  self-respect and humiliation on the basis of promises that were not likely to 
  be honoured. A dedication to principle could have saved the Tamils from the 
  calamity that was to come. The betrayal of democracy by the T.U.L.F. at this 
  point may be compared with that by well-heeled Tamil gentlemen in Parliament 
  voting for the bills of 1948 which made plantation workers of Indian origin, 
  also fellow Tamils, non-citizens. At that time Mr. S. J. V. Chelvanayakam, the 
  founder of the T.U.L.F., did the honourable thing in passionately opposing that 
  bill. But the old habit of the Tamil elite being voluntary slaves to the Sinhalese 
  ruling class, from whom they received patronage, had not changed.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><b><span style='letter-spacing:-.1pt'>27 November,

<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='letter-spacing:-.1pt'>In the meantime 
  things were taking a different turn, involving spontaneous mass protests over 
  the detention of several prominent Tamils on suspicion of being involved with 
  militants: &quot;Tamil politics entered a new mass agitational phase in Jaffna 
  this week, following the arrests and questioning of several Roman Catholic, 
  Methodist and Anglican priests in connection with terrorism and the Neervely 
  Bank robbery of 1981 and the peremptory ascribing of guilt to the members of 
  the clergy by the State-controlled and other media in Colombo.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span>      </span>&quot;Whole-day protest fasts 
  and sit-ins are being held throughout the peninsula with the Tamil United Liberation 
  Front itself actively mounting a chorus of protests. On Tuesday 30th, there 
  will be a collective one-day fast in both the North and the East, demanding 
  an end to the arbitrary detention of the priests and University Assistant Lecturer 
  Nithyananthan and his wife Nirmala, the abolition of the prevention of Terrorism 
  Act and an end to State terrorism.&quot;</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span>      </span>The arrested priests were of 
  course the Rev. Fr. Singarayar, the Rev. Fr. Sinnarasa (both Roman Catholic), 
  Rev. Jeyatilakarajah (Methodist) and the Rev. Donald Kanagaratnam (Anglican, 
  Vavuniya). Dr. Jeyakularajah (Puttur Mission Hospital), brother of the Rev. 
  Jeyatilekarajah was also arrested. The Rev. Kanagaratnam, formerly principal 
  of the Pilimatalawa Theological seminary, was released shortly afterwards. He 
  had resigned his principalship at the seminary after some Sinhalese members 
  made an issue of his refusal to raise the national flag on Independence Day 
  1978 on the grounds that the Tamil speaking part of the nation had suffered 
  grievous oppression during the 1977 race riots. He had then gone on to found 
  Unity House in the border area of Vavuniya to work for Sinhalese-Tamil amity. 
  He had good personal relations with the Sinhalese of that area. Rev. Singarayar 
  was finally released after the July 1987 Accord. The rest had escaped to India 
  from Batticaloa prison. They and Fr. Singarayar had narrowly escaped during 
  the two prison massacres in July 1983.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span>      </span>On the lighter side, soldiers 
  who had been sent to search the home of the Nithyanandans, in the same compound 
  as that of Nirmala's parents, Mr. &amp; Mrs. Rajasingam, were asked to wait 
  there. The soldiers felt bored, having nothing to do. They went about plucking 
  flowers and made a large garland, which was then presented to the cow tied in 
  the compound.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span>      </span>Previously, in the issue of 
  20 November, 1982, the Saturday Review had strongly protested the slanderous 
  allegations being made with impunity against those arrested, in the Southern 
  press, with a lead piece titled &quot;STOP THIS PEN AND DAGGER JOURNALISM.&quot;<b></b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><b><span
style='letter-spacing:-.1pt'>11 December, 1982:</span></b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='letter-spacing:-.1pt'>Writing in the 
  section &quot;Political Causerie,&quot; the Colombo based columnist Gamini Navaratne, 
  dealt with President Jayewardene's allegation of a &quot;Naxalite Plot,&quot; 
  as the excuse for holding the referendum in place of the General Elections. 
  The alleged Naxalites were a group of Mrs. Bandaranaike's S.L.F.P., which led 
  the presidential campaign of its candidate Mr. Hector Kobbekaduwa. According 
  to President Jayewardene's information, this group had planned to assassinate 
  him, a few other Ministers, Mrs. Bandaranaike's son Anura and the Armed Services 
  Chiefs, among others. According to him, they would thereupon do away with the 
  constitution and imprison Mrs. Bandaranaike. Except for farcical dramas like 
  the questioning of Mr. Kobbekaduwa, nothing was ever proved then or in later 
  years.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span>      </span>Gamini Navaratne referred to 
  several instances where members of the U.N.P. had openly indulged in violence 
  and where no action had been taken: after the 1977 elections, in June 1981 during 
  the D.D.C. elections, in August 1981 when communal violence had been unleashed 
  in many places including the plantations and after the Presidential elections. 
  The persons who attacked the meeting of the Sinhala Balamandalaya had no action 
  taken against them, even after they had been identified by others. Navaratne 
  added: &quot;Unless action is taken against them, could sections of the opposition 
  be blamed if they regard the latest coup allegation as a cover for the Government, 
  while keeping the S.L.F.P. machinery effectively strangled, to distract people's 
  attention from the looming economic crisis, instil fear in their minds about 
  a &quot;Naxalite&quot;, (that is Communist) threat and stampede them into saying 
  &quot;Yes&quot; at the Referendum by clever manipulation of the state-monopolised 
  mass media?&quot;</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span>      </span>Protest against the Prevention 
  of Terrorism Act and the recent arrests reached a high point in Vavuniya when 
  steel helmeted police used batons and tear gas inside St. Anthony's Church at 
  Rambaikulam on 15 December.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><b><span
style='letter-spacing:-.1pt'>18 December, 1982</span></b><span
style='letter-spacing:-.1pt'>: </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='letter-spacing:-.1pt'>&quot;Hundreds 
  of girls, women, children and men - including Buddhists, Muslims, Hindus and 
  Christians - began a protest fast on Wednesday on the church premises. As scheduled, 
  a silent march headed by school-girls with mouths gagged and wearing black badges 
  had just come to the road when police pounced upon them, dragged the girls by 
  their hair, and kicked and baton-charged them when they defied police orders 
  to disperse. The baton charge took place when the girls sat on the ground refusing 
  to move. Then the police stormed into the church and baton charged protestors 
  who sought refuge there.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span>      </span>&quot;Nine people were arrested 
  including the Gandhiyam's Dr. Rajasundaram, Mr. M.S. Kandiah (Social Worker, 
  75 years old), T.E.L.F. Secretary M. K. Eelaventhan, Dr. K.S.N. Fernando and 
  David Naganathan. Tension was high in Vavuniya following the Police rampage 
  and all shops put up their shutters.&quot; </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span>      </span>Dr. K.S.N. Fernando was a Sinhalese 
  doctor attached to Vavuniya hospital and a dedicated human rights activist. 
  He was subject to much abuse by Sub-Inspector Gunasinghe for being an alleged 
  traitor and was badly assaulted by the policeman who also took revenge on him 
  for having earlier filed an affidavit before the Supreme Court. After his arrest 
  Dr. Fernando was at one point beaten unconscious. The Sub-Inspector who indiscriminately 
  assaulted participants, also threatened to kill a Kumarasinghe if he was there. 
  Kumarasinghe was a Sinhalese activist for the Movement for Inter Racial Justice 
  and Equality (M.I.R.J.E.) in Vavuniya.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span>      </span>The government's handling of 
  these protests was fuelling Tamil anger without in any way reducing the momentum 
  of the protests. The spate of public protests continued. The students of the 
  University of Jaffna organised a large demonstration on 26 January, 1983, followed 
  by a 4 day fast starting on 1 February, 1983.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span>      </span>The results of the referendum 
  were announced on 23 December, 1982 the day after polling. The &quot;Yes&quot; 
  vote to extend the term of the government came to 54.66% of the valid votes, 
  with the &quot;No'' vote amounting to 45.34%. Of registered voters, 70.7% voted 
  as opposed to 80% in the Presidential elections. But that was not the whole 
  story. The Government had used its machinery, both official and unofficial, 
  to perpetrate election fraud on an unprecedented scale. This was a country where 
  elections had traditionally been reasonably clean. It was some time before the 
  details came out.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span>      </span>In his book, &quot;<i>Sri Lanka: 
  The Holocaust and After</i>&quot;, (Marram Books, London, 1984), L. Piyadasa 
  rightly argues that, in a country where voter participation has been traditionally 
  high, as much as 86.7% in 1977, the natural instinct of the people would have 
  been to say that they wanted elections to elect their own representatives, even 
  if only to return the U.N.P. with a massive majority. This consideration itself 
  made the result of the referendum highly improbable. All indications are that 
  there were many untoward happenings starting with the partiality of the police. 
  Piyadasa rightly argues: </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='letter-spacing:-.1pt'>&quot;Moreover, 
  opposition polling observers were, in a large number of carefully checked cases, 
  prevented by threats of murder or of having their homes burnt, by false arrest, 
  assault and robbery of documents, (e.g.: identification) from functioning as 
  polling observers. Officially appointed presiding officers were intimidated 
  and manhandled when they challenged impersonators or tried to stop thuggery 
  within polling booths by legally unauthorized persons. Many voters were prevented 
  from voting freely or voting at all. This was done openly, with police connivance 
  or collaboration, by U.N.P. thugs in many ways, including compelling voters 
  to show how they had marked their papers and preventing people known to be members 
  of &quot;Vote NO&quot; groups and parties from leaving their homes. Very prominent 
  in the organising and carrying out of the violence and intimidation were Paul 
  Perera (who was not long afterwards nominated to be an M.P.), and a gun wielding 
  M.P., Anura Bastian, whom the President appointed Deputy Minister in charge 
  of the Home Guards soon afterwards! There was impersonation on a scale never 
  before attempted in Sri Lanka. In one polling booth, the Presiding Officer had 
  counted one person voting 72 times, and had officially reported this to his 
  superior. In most of the country it required real courage to vote &quot;No&quot; 
  in these conditions.&quot; </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span>      </span>There were other minor miracles 
  too. In Mrs. Bandaranaike's electorate Attanagala, she as the leader of the 
  S.L.F.P. decided to withdraw all her observers and party agents from her electorate. 
  This was after her agents were brutally and repeatedly beaten up and threatened 
  with death. In this electorate where she had received a massive majority in 
  1977, the &quot;Yes&quot; votes counted after the polling were 35,747, as against 
  22,531 for Jayewardene at the presidential election!</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span>      </span>In the Jaffna district, the 
  voter turn out was 290,849 - 60% of registered voters - of whom 91.3% voted 
  &quot;No,&quot; no that is, to extending the life of the parliament. The voter 
  turn out was 46% for the presidential elections. The voter turn out would certainly 
  have been much higher if the T.U.L.F. had actively campaigned for the &quot;No&quot; 
  vote. The registered voters in Jaffna numbered 493,705. The voting population 
  in Ceylon was 8,148,015. The majority claimed by the government was 535,240. 
  All Tamil districts voted for having General Elections: Vanni - 64.9%, Trincomalee 
  - 56.4%, and Batticaloa - 60.1%; so did, in general, the districts of the deep 
  South, despite the intimidation: Kalutara - 50.4%, Galle -52.6%, Hambantota 
  - 55% and Matara -49.2%. It is these last named districts that form the base 
  for the J.V.P.'s current (1988) insurgency against the government. The government's 
  proposal to continue the present parliament for another term received its highest 
  support, with the malpractices, in the areas with a high estate Tamil population 
  whose leader Mr. S. Thondaman was a minister in the government: Nuwara Eliya 
  - 72.7%, Badulla - 69.9%, Kandy - 62.2%, and Matale - 73.5%. This was an irony, 
  in view of the legislation against this community in 1948/49 by a U.N.P. government 
  of the time.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span>      </span>It may be mentioned that the 
  vote in the Laggala electorate in the Matale district was challenged. The Sun 
  had reported on 23 December, that the voters had been cut off from their polling 
  stations as a result of floods and earthslips. But out of an electorate of 35,129, 
  26,115 registered their votes at the referendum, as compared with 17,354 at 
  the presidential polls!</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span>      </span>In the Tamil districts, the 
  low voter turn out (60-70%), together with the somewhat indecisive vote (except 
  in Jaffna), can be attributed to the failure of the T.U.L.F. to form a common 
  front with the parties wanting general elections and mounting a campaign to 
  underline a sense of urgency. The excuse normally offered by the T.U.L.F. and 
  Mr. Thondaman's C.W.C. (Ceylon Workers Congress representing Tamil Plantation 
  Workers) for neither campaigning against nor supporting the government, is that 
  the former coalition government of Mrs. Bandaranaike which included the two 
  major Left parties, the L.S.S.P. and the C.P., had completely ignored them. 
  This was true. But at the same time the present U.N.P. government only listened 
  to them nominally. It had already showed a tendency to use race riots as a political 
  weapon in August 1981 in which many of the victims were plantation Tamils supporting 
  the C.W.C.. President Jayewardene, while blaming some of his own party in moving 
  words, did nothing to discipline them. The unkindest cut of all was to come 
  in July 1983. The only real option that had been open to the T.U.L.F. and the 
  C.W.C. was to take a principled stand on behalf of the democratic rights of 
  the whole country and oppose the government. This would have increased their 
  prestige throughout the country and possibly brought them out of marginal patronage 
  politics into national politics. The position of the Tamils too would have been 
  rendered more secure in the long run.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span>      </span>To many it would seem unbelievable 
  that the T.U.L.F. under a once combative leader like Amirthalingam, should sit 
  back and allow things to drift waiting for the promised jam. The T.U.L.F. too 
  had reflected the general lack of conviction about democracy amongst the Tamil 
  elite, whose public conduct was for the most part based on patronage. Although 
  not very evident at that time, the T.U.L.F.'s inactivity during the referendum 
  had cut it adrift from its political base. The Jaffna voter had shown that he 
  had a mind of his own by registering a 91.3% vote against the government's proposal. 
  Despite the T.U.L.F.'s lukewarmness, 60% (14% more than in the Presidential 
  elections) had taken the trouble to go and register their opinion. For a political 
  party to indulge in secret talks without actively articulating the feelings 
  in its own constituency, spelt political suicide.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span>      </span>President Jayewardene could 
  now afford to treat the Tamils and their representatives with contempt. As far 
  as his immediate ambitions were concerned, he had the Tamils in his pocket, 
  as he did his party's M.P.s. The Tamils were now subject to his whims and his 
  irresponsibility. He was not going to give them jam. He was going to give them 
  cake in the sense in which Marie Antoniette meant it, when the Parisians asked 
  for bread.</p>

<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='letter-spacing:-.1pt'>Little attention 
  was paid to the vote in the deep South at this time. In a <i>post-mortem</i> 
  of the referendum by Staff Writer Suresh in the Saturday Review, it was pointed 
  out that the electorates of 5 Cabinet Ministers, 5 Deputy Ministers and 19 U.N.P. 
  M.P.s &quot;voted clearly for a dissolution of the present government.&quot; 
  Most of those were in the deep South.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span>      </span>But in early 1983, with the 
  Tamils in the President's pocket and the South under the heel of the Police 
  and the U.N.P. goon squads, the fraud was accepted meekly. Given the situation 
  of burning anger and humiliation below the surface in the South, a mounting 
  insurgency in the North and the government's control over the media, the government 
  with its characteristic irresponsibility and cynicism, found it very natural 
  to direct Sinhalese feelings to find release in an orgy of anti-Tamil violence.</p>

  decision making processes, that we are now under very close surveillance and 
  scrutiny and the axe might fall on us any time.&quot;</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span>      </span>In a climate of increasing repression 
  in the South, which began with the break up of the 1980 general strike and the 
  advent of the multi-nationals which began to disrupt life even in remote villages, 
  the Left felt helpless. The only Sinhalese area where there was some active 
  opposition to the state was in the Moneragala District, where some Leftist groups 
  were helping the villagers to resist the takeover of common lands by sugar multinationals, 
  through protest campaigns. For this reason, many Left leaning persons and organisations 
  in the South were looking to the North for inspiration, where there was popular 
  resistance to the government. The Ceylon Teachers' Union (with 47,000 members) 
  and the Revolutionary Marxist Party, had in June 1982 issued statements opposing 
  the extradition from India to Ceylon of Mr. Prabhakaran and Mr. Uma Maheswaran, 
  arrested in India a few weeks earlier.</p>

  party, the N.S.S.P., a break away group of the old L.S.S.P., led by Vasudeva 
  Nanayakkara and Vikramabahu Karunaratne, made a considerable impact in Jaffna 
  and even acquired a following amongst students. It advocated self-determination 
  for the Tamils. Its base in the South too was small, but was concentrated in 
  certain areas. Its leader, Mr. Nanayakkara, later fought a remarkable by-election 
  after the July 1983 violence, which got the government truly worried. Unlike 
  the old ways of fighting elections, the N.S.S.P. laid down its policy towards 
  Tamils clearly before the Sinhalese constituency. The threat was taken so seriously 
  that President Jayewardene himself made a campaign appearance. There was a high 
  incidence of state thuggery. Many believe that Mr. Nanayakkara actually won 
  the by-election.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span>      </span>However the Left was too divided 
  at this time to make an impact. It could not decide on a single candidate for 
  the Presidential elections. It was mainly romanticising about future possibilities, 
  often put forward as certainties, as in Bala Tampoe's case, cited above. However 
  the interest shown by the Left in the South helped to give the Tamil militants 
  a Leftist image.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span>      </span>The Saturday Review's issue 
  of 19 February, 1983, also reported a court-room drama which made a powerful 
  impact in this country as well as amongst Tamils living abroad: </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='letter-spacing:-.1pt'>This happened 
  on Thursday when Senior Defence Counsel N. Satyendra, concluding his <i>voire 
  dire</i> proceedings of the Neervely Bank Cash Robbery told court: &quot;As 
  regards my clients, the accused, I wish to state publicly from this Court of 
  record, that in the presence of those individuals who belong to my community 
  and who have been prepared to sacrifice what is perhaps the most precious possession 
  of any individual - his very life - for the cause of liberation of their people, 
  I feel humble.&quot;</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span>      </span>The accused in this case are: 
  Navaratnarajah, Thangavelu (Thangadurai), Selvarajah Yogachandran (Kuttimani), 
  Siva Subramaniam Sri Sabaratnam (Thevan), Nadarajah (Sivapalan Master), Sundaram 
  Sri Sabaratnam, who is absconding and Vaithilingam Nadesadasan.&quot; </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='letter-spacing:-.1pt'>It was this 
  group from which the T.E.L.O. claimed its antecedents and was led by the third 
  named Sri Sabaratnam. Kuttimani and Thangadurai died during the prison massacre 
  of 25 July, 1983. What would not have been dreamed of by the public at this 
  time was that the T.E.L.O. leader would be killed 39 months later on the orders 
  of the leadership of Mr. Prabhakaran's Tigers.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><b><span
style='letter-spacing:-.1pt'>5 March, 1983:</span></b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='letter-spacing:-.1pt'>The unprecedented 
  court drama had its second act on 24 February, 1983 when the first accused, 
  Thangathurai, made a moving statement before the court. Subsequently the six 
  accused were sentenced to life imprisonment on two counts and 15 years of rigorous 
  imprisonment each on two other counts. The presiding High Court Judge was Mr. 
  C. L. T. Moonemale. Thangathurai's speech may have been a historic speech had 
  his political heirs become successful. At that time it had an effect on the 
  Tamils from which all militant factions benefited. The third anniversary of 
  the Welikade prison massacre took place shortly after the decimation of the 
  T.E.L.O. by the Tigers which rekindled some of the scenes of the July 1983 anti-Tamil 
  pogrom. In several places attempts to distribute leaflets commemorating the 
  prison massacre in which Kuttimani and Thangathurai died were stopped by the 
  Tigers.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span>      </span>Thangathurai's moving speech 
  in Tamil eloquently recalled the historic experience of the Tamils and contained 
  these lines: &quot;We are not lovers of violence nor victims of mental disorders. 
  We are fighters belonging to an organisation that is struggling to liberate 
  our people. To those noble souls who keep prating terrorism, we have something 
  to say. Did you not get frightened of terrorism when hundreds of Tamils got 
  massacred in cold blood, when racist hate spread like fire in this country of 
  yours? Did terrorism mean nothing to you when Tamil women were raped? When cultural 
  treasures were set on fire? When hundreds of Tamil homes were looted? Why, in 
  1977 alone 400 Tamils lost their lives reddening the sky above with their splattered 
  blood. Did you not see any terrorism then? It is only when a few policemen are 
  killed in Tamil Eelam and a few million rupees bank money robbed that terrorism 
  strikes you in the face... But my fervent prayer is that innocent Sinhalese 
  people should not have to reap what power hungry Sinhalese politicians have 
  sown. These tribulations are a boon bestowed by God to purify us. The final 
  victory is ours.&quot;</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span>      </span>At this point student unrest 
  in all of Ceylon's Universities was taking shape. What must have disturbed the 
  government was the co-ordination between the student bodies of the different 
  universities. This was sundered in the climate of racism following the July 
  1983 disturbances. However this did not bring peace to the Universities in the 
  South which came to be known as more closed than open. The mood of racism fostered 
  by the government, accompanied by frustration with the government itself, provided 
  fresh opportunities for the J.V.P. in the coming years. However, the mood at 
  that time was captured in a report in the Saturday Review: &quot;Repeal the 
  Prevention of Terrorism Act&quot;. This was one of the main demands of undergraduates 
  of all universities and university campuses in Sri Lanka who carried out a one-day 
  token boycott of lectures on 24 February. The undergraduates have also demanded 
  that the government keep its hands off the Universities. This demand refers 
  specifically to the statement made recently by University Grants Commission 
  (U.G.C.), Chairman Dr. Stanley Kalpage, that legislation is on the way to take 
  over the administration of the universities and his threat that the U.G.C. would 
  cancel the scholarships and loan facilities of students who go on strike... 
  The third demand of the undergraduates was that students of the Kotelawala Defence 
  Academy should not be admitted to the University of Colombo.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><b><span

<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='letter-spacing:-.1pt'>This issue reported 
  mounting unrest in Jaffna over the detention of three students. It went on: 
  &quot;Meanwhile a wave of discontent is sweeping the University Campuses throughout 
  the country. The Colombo University strike went into the second week while undergraduates 
  at Peradeniya, Kelaniya, Ruhuna and Batticaloa began boycotting all classes 
  on Monday protesting the 'Police brutality' unleashed on the strikers at Colombo 
  and Sri Jayewardenepura Universities.&quot;</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span>      </span>Around this time events were 
  gaining a new momentum. On 4 March two Army vehicles were ambushed near Kilinochchi 
  injuring five soldiers. On 14 March Government Officers wielding clubs and batons, 
  claiming to act on the orders of the Assistant Government Agent set fire to 
  16 huts belonging to hill country Tamils in a refugee settlement at Pankulam, 
  Trincomalee District. The refugees were supported by Gandhiyam. This was a sign 
  that the state was preparing to use an iron fist against communities, as opposed 
  to individuals as in the past.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span>      </span>On 5 April 1983, a march organised 
  by students protesting the P.T.A. was beaten and broken up by a Police tear-gas 
  attack. The marchers had initially avoided a Police cordon by starting from 
  the Cathedral grounds instead of the grounds of St. James' Church, Main Street, 
  as earlier announced. (The news that was immediately alarming was the government 
  crackdown on Gandhiyam.)</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><b><span

<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='letter-spacing:-.1pt'>&quot;Gandhiyam 
  Society, the only major voluntary service organisation engaged in community 
  development projects in Tamil areas in Sri Lanka and the only active body looking 
  after Tamil refugee resettlements, was raided by a combined team of Sri Lankan 
  Army, Police and Criminal Investigation Department officials on Wednesday, 6th 
  April at 10:00 a.m. The Organising Secretary of Gandhiyam, Dr. S. Rajasundaram, 
  was himself taken away to an unspecified destination. Since there was no warrant 
  for his arrest and since no reasons were given, it is believed that he was taken 
  into custody under the notorious Prevention of Terrorism Act.&quot;</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><b><span
style='letter-spacing:-.1pt'>30 April, 1983:</span></b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='letter-spacing:-.1pt'>The death of 
  Navaratnarajah in Army custody further aroused Tamil indignation over the treatment 
  of prisoners under the P.T.A.. The lead story in the Saturday Review read: &quot;There 
  were twenty-five external injuries and ten internal injuries in the deceased 
  Navaratnarajah's body. The contusions in his lungs could have been caused by 
  blows. I am of the opinion that death was due to cardio-respiratory failure, 
  due to multiple muscle injuries and contusions of the lungs. In my opinion, 
  adequate treatment from an institution would have saved his life.&quot; So said 
  Dr. N. Saravanapavananthan, A.J.M.O., submitting his medical report in the inquest 
  of 28-year old Navaratnarajah of Trincomalee who died in Army custody at the 
  Gurunagar Army Camp, Jaffna, on the 10th of April. Navaratnarajah was arrested 
  two weeks previously on suspicion under the P.T.A..&quot;</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span>      </span>N. Saravanapavananthan, Professor 
  of Forensic Medicine, Jaffna, is one of those souls as unbending as his native 
  palmyrah. He can be trusted never to compromise his professional judgement. 
  After the inquest on Navaratnarajah was completed, the police searched the documents 
  in the mortuary for the file. But Prof. Sara had taken the precaution of keeping 
  the file in a safe place. He was an old hand at this work. In 1971 as Judicial 
  Medical Officer in Galle during the Sinhalese youth insurgency, he could not 
  be prevented from exhuming a whole heap of bodies near Giniganga - bodies of 
  youngsters massacred <i>en masse </i>by security forces. The I.P.K.F. was compelled 
  to treat him with respect, even when on an occasion he reversed the opinion 
  of another doctor in the case of a rape complaint. The same issue of the Saturday 
  Review reflected the feeling of alienation felt by the Tamils in a hard hitting 
  editorial, titled &quot;AWAY WITH THIS ABOMINABLE ACT&quot;. It contained these 
  words:</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span>      </span>&quot;The first of such laws 
  was promulgated in the very year of 'freedom' - the Citizenship Act No. 18 of 
  1948, which effectively excluded a section of the Tamils from citizenship. Then 
  came the Indian and Pakistan Residents (Citizenship) Act No. 3 of 1949 and the 
  Ceylon (Parliamentary Elections) Amendment Act No. 48 of 1949 which disenfranchised 
  a large section of Tamils. Then came the Sinhalese Only law in 1956, making 
  every Tamil in this country, irrespective of what doctorates some of them held, 
  virtual illiterates in their land of birth. The Prevention of Terrorism Act 
  is now over three years old. What has the government achieved by it up to now?&quot;</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><b><span
style='letter-spacing:-.1pt'>30 April 30, 1983 </span></b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='letter-spacing:-.1pt'>This issue highlighted 
  the detention and torture of senior Architect, Arulanandam David, President 
  of Gandhiyam, at Panagoda military barracks. In a telegram sent to the president, 
  Lawyer Kumaralingam stated that detainee Rajendran was passing blood and was 
  suffering from frequency of micturation. Lawyers gained access to David through 
  a court order after David had been forced to sign a confession under torture.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span>      </span>The same issue also drew attention 
  to countrywide repression. A meeting of the Civil Rights Movement held on 15 
  April 1983 and presided over by its Chairman Bishop Lakshman Wickremasinghe 
  expressed concern at the growing indications of police misconduct. It listed 
  in particular: assaults against journalists at Kotmale; assault and unlawful 
  detention of a 17-year-old boy at the Kandy police station; assaults against 
  women strikers at Ekala; assaults against students at Jayewardenepura; death 
  of a suspect held in police custody at Matale; assault against pavement hawkers 
  in Colombo; and assault against former M.P. Mrs. Vivienne Gunawardene.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span>      </span>Following the announcement of 
  local government elections three U.N.P. men in the North were shot dead (Ratnasingam, 
  Rajaratnam and Muttiah). This brought to five the number of U.N.P. men killed 
  (with Thiagarajah in 1981, and Thambapillai in November 1982). In a leaflet 
  by the L.T.T.E. claiming responsibility for these killings the T.U.L.F. was 
  branded as an evil force which was Eelamist only in connection with elections. 
  The L.T.T.E. called for a boycott of the elections scheduled for 18th May, causing 
  some leading T.U.L.F. candidates to withdraw and U.N.P. members to leave the 
  party. At one meeting (8 May) when militant youths fired into the air, everyone, 
  including the speakers on the platform, ran away except for the T.U.L.F. Secretary 
  General and Leader of the Opposition, Mr. A. Amirthalingam. </p>

<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='letter-spacing:-.1pt'>This issue of 
  the Saturday Review had this to say: &quot;Tamil Undergraduates and a few Tamil 
  lecturers fled the University of Peradeniya on Thursday and Friday following 
  assaults by some Sinhalese undergraduates. Some Tamil students have been admitted 
  to Kandy hospital with injuries. A few days back a student group had staged 
  a Tamil translation of Jean-Paul Satre's &quot;Men Without Shadows&quot;. The 
  torture and cruelty by the Nazi soldiers of French resistance fighters was suspected 
  of being portrayed in a way as to resemble local conditions. Later pamphlets 
  issued by the L.T.T.E. were found pasted on the Science Faculty walls&quot;.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span>      </span>Another provocation for the 
  violence seems to be the tarring of the English and Sinhalese lettering at the 
  entrance to the University. This incident was suspected of having been engineered. 
  A long standing tradition at the Faculty of Engineering held when Sinhalese 
  students protected fellow Tamil students. Elsewhere Tamil students were told: 
  &quot;No campus and no Eelam for you bastards.&quot;</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span>      </span>The turn out for the local polls 
  on 18 May was low for reasons varying from support for the L.T.T.E. to fear. 
  The L.T.T.E. went beyond the boycott call and attacked a polling booth: &quot;About 
  64 houses, three mini-buses, nine cars, three motor-cycles and 36 bicycles were 
  set on fire by Army men on a rampage at Kantharmadam in Jaffna on Wednesday 
  the 18th evening and night as soon as a state of emergency came into force a 
  5:00 p.m.. This is believed to be the Army's &quot;reply&quot; to the killing 
  of Corporal Jayewardene by militant youths at a polling centre in the vicinity 
  an hour earlier.&quot;</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><b><span
style='letter-spacing:-.1pt'>21 May, 1983:</span></b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='letter-spacing:-.1pt'>The army had 
  now accepted collective reprisals as a weapon. In two months the army would 
  take on unarmed civilians. The Saturday Review contained a report by Dr. M. 
  S. L. Salgado, J.M.O., Colombo, indicating that the Gandhiyam secretary Dr. 
  Rajasundaram had almost certainly been badly assaulted and tortured.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span>      </span>The incidents at Pankulam and 
  Kantharmadam marked a conscious new trend in the government's thinking. What 
  took place at Kantharmadam was not a spontaneous action. It was systematically 
  done after a senior officer arrived and gave an order. With the exception of 
  one goat there was no loss of life. The crossing of the Rubicon which set the 
  stage for indiscriminate mass killing came with the announcement by a Defence 
  Ministry spokesman that: &quot;The armed forces and the police in the North 
  are to be given legal immunity from judicial proceedings and wide ranging powers 
  of search and destroy&quot;. The University students in Jaffna came to the fore 
  in collecting money and materials and providing relief for the victims at Kantharmadam.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><b><span
style='letter-spacing:-.1pt'>4 June, 1983:</span></b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='letter-spacing:-.1pt'>The lead story 
  in the Saturday Review quoted the statement published in the Sun: &quot;Under 
  such circumstances soldiers were compelled to react as during a war particularly 
  in their role of fighting armed terrorists who had no compunction about killing 
  servicemen or members of the public. In view of this it has been felt that police 
  and service-men in the North should be given the freedom of the battlefield 
  rather than having their morale sapped through conflicts with legal niceties. 
  This is not a peacetime situation and the police and services must be provided 
  with adequate safeguards when attempting to control the problem&quot;.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span>      </span>The new immunity was Emergency 
  Regulation 15A of 3 July 1983 which allowed the security forces to bury or cremate 
  bodies of people shot by them without revealing their identities or carrying 
  out inquests. It was widely believed that these new powers were a direct reaction 
  to the evidence proferred by A.J.M.O. Dr. Saravanapavanandan at the inquest 
  of Navaratnarajah who died in army custody. This was not an issue connected 
  with the &quot;freedom of the battlefield.&quot; It was murder of a helpless 
  captive. In general Tamils became both angry and frightened. They rightly believed 
  that the government was arming itself with powers for some course of action 
  that went beyond dealing with an admittedly deteriorating law and order situation.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span>      </span>Almost 12 hours after the government's 
  announcement of tough new measures under the Public Security Act, Mr. Thilagar, 
  a hospital employee and U.N.P. candidate for the municipal elections was shot 
  at 6:15 a.m. on 4 June, at the Jaffna hospital. If the government was heading 
  towards lighting the tinder, the militants were determined to help things along.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span>      </span>The same issue of the Saturday 
  Review also carried news of an army rampage in Vavuniya: &quot;Service personnel 
  destroyed the Gandhiyam farm at Kovilkulam, about one and a half miles away 
  from Vavuniya town on Wednesday 1st June. The rampaging servicemen who came 
  in trucks destroyed the crops and huts and set fire to the farm buildings and 
  vehicles. Three tractors and a van were burnt.&quot;</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span>      </span>This happened after a four man 
  guerrilla group flung bombs at an airforce jeep and then opened fire, killing 
  airmen U. L. M. Perera and W. A. Gunasekera. This happened at the vegetable 
  market where the airmen were shopping. It may be noted that this incident took 
  place before the announcement of new measures and there was no loss of civilian 
  life. The guerrillas were later identified with a group within the P.L.O.T.E..</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span>      </span>The 4 June issue further reported 
  that on 30 May, Sabaratnam Palanivel, a young van driver of Valvettithurai was 
  dragged into the Valvettithurai army camp and shot dead by Corporal M. Wimalaratne. 
  This happened around 4:30 a.m. when Palanivel was driving home after taking 
  some relatives who wanted to catch the Trincomalee bus. Later an army truck 
  ran over the dead body. This was the last time army offenders were brought before 
  a Magistrate. Hence forward the situation in the country was to be qualitatively 
  different. During the course of the Tamil insurgency, every death up to this 
  time was an issue that aroused keen concern. Over the next five years, both 
  freedom and value of life would continue to decline, not only in the North, 
  but also in the South.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><b><span
style='letter-spacing:-.1pt'>11 June, 1983:</span></b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='letter-spacing:-.1pt'>A last plea 
  for sanity was contained in a telegram sent to President Jayewardene on behalf 
  of the Civil Rights Movement, by its secretary Desmond Fernando. The subject 
  was the new powers being granted to the security forces. Bishop Lakshman Wickremasinghe, 
  the president of the C.R.M. was to die a broken man on 23 October, the same 
  year - broken by the blood letting that was to envelope the whole country. The 
  C.R.M. felt a frequent need to refer to the events of 1971 involving the Sinhalese 
  youth insurgency, which led to its formation when the Left government of Mrs. 
  Bandaranaike was in power. This was because Jayewardene's chosen tactics to 
  dismiss the counsels of the C.R.M. was to brand it a Communist or Communist 
  inspired (and hence subversive) organisation. That was how the destructive mind 
  of the government worked. Quoted below is an extract from the telegram, published 
  in the Saturday Review of 11 June, 1963:</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='letter-spacing:-.1pt'>&quot;The granting 
  of such powers will create again the excesses of 1971 when similar powers resulted 
  in deaths under torture, indiscriminate killings and execution without trial 
  by security forces, which usurp functions of courts in determining who is a 
  terrorist and who is not; and leading to slaughter of many never established 
  to have been involved in insurgent activities. Revocation of this horrifying 
  regulation was one of the main demands of the CRM at its inception in 1971.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span>      </span>&quot;... It must guarantee 
  that all such persons are dealt with by due process of the law and in keeping 
  with the fundamental principles of justice... <i>for otherwise a government 
  would be flouting the principles of justice that are vital to democracy in the 
  very act of claiming to defend democratic institutions.</i></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span>      </span>&quot;The Working Committee 
  of the C.R.M. also points out that the International Covenant of Civil and Political 
  Rights which Your Excellency's Government has signed specifically provides that 
  the right to life and the right to protection from torture cannot be derogated 
  from even at a time of emergency threatening the life of the nation.&quot;</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span>      </span>This plea came against a background 
  of racist attacks throughout the country. The situation in Trincomalee was particularly 
  grim, where the Saturday Review of 11 June reported one killing and several 
  bomb attacks. The fact that these racist attacks were taking place while there 
  was a curfew on, strongly suggested the connivance of the armed forces. </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span>      </span>The situation there was to get 
  worse in the weeks to come. In one incident several Tamil passengers travelling 
  in a van were attacked and burnt with the van. Several Tamils who experienced 
  these harrowing days in Trincomalee said that during curfew, racist hoodlums 
  would attack them at home, and if they tried to flee, the security forces would 
  shoot them as curfew breakers. It was clear that the government had decided 
  to use brazen force to drive away Tamils from several areas of the North and 
  East where they felt relatively safe. Especially targeted were the Trincomalee 
  District and the settlements where Tamil refugees from the 1977 violence had 
  after several years of hard work become economically stable. There was the chilly 
  nip of unreason in the air.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span>      </span>On 2 July, 1983, the Saturday 
  Review was sealed by the state just before its front and back pages could be 
  printed. With all its shortcomings it had been a voice of humanity. Before the 
  referendum fraud of December 1982, it had done for the whole country a courageous 
  service, which the press in the South was constrained from doing, by giving 
  articulation to a wide spectrum of voices from around the country protesting 
  at the deception. It had done much to secure an impressive vote in Jaffna against 
  the government, despite the T.U.L.F.'s silence. Henceforward to stand up for 
  reason and humanity in Ceylon, was to become several times more dangerous - 
  in the South as well as in the North. Shortly after the July 1983 violence, 
  Mr. S. Sivanayagam, the paper's editor, would seek exile in India.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span>      </span>When the paper resumed publication 
  several months later, its role would be very different, one of its main tasks 
  being to catalogue a seemingly endless series of gory happenings. Constraints 
  on press freedom would come from unexpected quarters. The old interest in political 
  debate and development issues would be vastly reduced. One would miss contributions 
  from readers on the importance of the Palmyrah Palm, heritage matters, problems 
  of the Vanni farmer etc.. The optimism and the sense of forward movement were 
  gone. Many of the lights had gone out. The sins of omission and commission had 
  much to do with this. Even as the paper was being sealed, it was preparing for 
  a future that was qualitatively different. The unpublished issue of 2 July, 
  1983 had the following lines from its future editor, Gamini Navaratne, B.Sc. 
  (Econ.) London, author of &quot;The Chinese Connexion,&quot; and for 30 years 
  a Westminster style lobby correspondent: &quot;If I have my own way, I will 
  send most of the present politicians to the moon. That's where they really belong.&quot; 
  That was saying a lot about the future.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span>      </span>We see that during the years 
  1977-83 there were two main currents in the Tamil community outside the scope 
  of parliamentary politics. One was to build up village level organisations of 
  communities, economically viable and conscious of their dignity and rights as 
  persons and communities. Their main weapon was to express, nonviolently, a feeling 
  of public anger and outrage when this dignity was violated. Such a tendency 
  was represented in Jaffna by the activities of the students.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span>      </span>The other tendency was represented 
  by the L.T.T.E. and sections of the P.L.O.T.E.. Their hit and run attacks against 
  the state, especially the police and the armed services,were creating a momentum 
  of their own. This tendency underwent rapid expansion after July 1983, marginalising 
  the people. Groups such as the E.R.O.S. and the E.P.R.L.F. concentrated mainly 
  on grass-roots work amongst the masses before July 1983, and did continue with 
  this for a time afterwards. But with India's entry and its adoption of the militant 
  groups, all of them became primarily military organisations.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span>      </span>The failure of the Tamil leadership 
  during this period was its lack of determination to move decisively to resolve 
  both intellectually and in practice its ambivalent attitude towards violence. 
  The murder of Dr. Rajasundaram during the second Welikade prison massacre of 
  27 July 1983 marked the end of an era. Much imaginative and dedicated work by 
  individuals who gave all they had was forgotten. By 1988 few lips would utter 
  the name of Dr. Rajasundaram. We are without a sense of history or a sense of 
  gratitude. That explains what became of us. There is something fatally sick 
  in a community that expends inordinate emotion on every passing scene, forgetting 
  the last and unable to make the connections with the events that had gone before. 
  A return to sanity will also involve a sober evaluation of our past. Many believe
