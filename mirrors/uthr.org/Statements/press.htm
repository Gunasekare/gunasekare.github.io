<h3>&quot;Stop harassing the public&quot;, monitors tell LTTE in Batticaloa </h3>
<p><b>Roy Mendis in Colombo, 9.35 PM SLT Friday May 10,2002 Lanka academic</b>. 
  The Head of the Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission (SLMM) in Batticalao, Lars Tidbeck,has 
  asked the LTTE to stop harassing the public.&quot;The SLMM is much concerned 
  about the harassment of the members of the public in Batticaloa district by 
  the LTTE,&quot; Tidbeck said in a press release today. <br>
  He had met Vishu alias Sithampara Pillai Gopalan,the LTTE's leader for Batticaloa 
  and Amparai districts, in Karadiyanaru on May 8 and requested him to have &quot;good 
  rapport&quot; with the members of the public and &quot;ensure that every one 
  in this area lives with peace of mind.&quot; <br>
  Referring to the case of Sithamparampillai, the 82 year old Notary Public who 
  the LTTE had abducted and released recently, Tidbeck asked Vishu to stop harassing 
  the senior citizen and leave him alone.Though Vishu gave an undertaking that 
  the LTTE would do so,the harassment continued, Tidbeck pointed out. <br>
  The SLMM Batticaloa would now inform its headquarters in Colombo about the matter 
  so that it could be taken up with the LTTE's High Command in the Wanni,the release 
  said. <br>
</p>
<p><b>Colombo, May 11. (PTI):</b> A district-level committee of Sri Lanka's overseas 
  truce monitoring body has expressed concern over the mounting instances of harassment 
  of civilians in the eastern Batticaloa district by the LTTE, and asked the rebel 
  group to seek to earn the peoples goodwill. <br>
  Lars Tibeck, who heads the monitoring committee for the district, said in a 
  statement released in Batticaloa town yesterday, that he had met local LTTE 
  political wing leaders to seek assurances that the people would be allowed to 
  live in peace. <br>
  The district panel said it had requested the Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission (SLMM) 
  in Colombo to convey its deep concern to the LTTE leadership. <br>
  The case of an 82-year-old notary, who was detained until a huge ransom was 
  paid to the LTTE, was mentioned specifically. Sitham parampillai had been released 
  after a ransom was paid, on an assurance that he would not be harassed any more. 
  But the victim had once again complained that he was receiving threatening requests, 
  the panel said. <br>
  SLMM is under fire from human rights activists and the media for not doing enough 
  to stop abductions, child conscription and harassment in the east. <br>
  However, the 23-member SLMM says it needs more manpower and has decided to bring 
  another two dozen monitors from other Scandina vian countries.<b> (Hindu 11/5/2002</b>).</p>
<h3>Abduction trauma prevents talk with monitors/ The Island 24/4/2002 </h3>
<p>An 82-year-old man from Batticaloa - allegedly abducted by the LTTE but released 
  after he promised to pay them a ransom of Rs. 2.5 million - is apparently so 
  traumatised that he refuses to meet officials of the Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission 
  (SLMM).<br>
  &quot;We are aware that he is back and we telephoned him because we had questions 
  pertaining to the incident,&quot; said Lars Tidbeck, SLMM representative in 
  Batticaloa. &quot;He was supposed to visit our office for the inquiry but he 
  never turned up.&quot;<br>
  Tidbeck said that the man was also not agreeable to SLMM officials visiting 
  him at home. &quot;He didn't want us to go there (home),&quot; he noted. <br>
  The man was abducted by the LTTE on April 15 but released two days later after 
  an assurance was given that the money would be paid, informed sources in Batticaloa 
  said. They added that a nephew of the man had stood personal surety for the 
  money that was to be paid in two instalments. Both Amnesty International and 
  the SLMM were informed.<br>
  The SLMM summoned him last Saturday but he did not appear. Tidbeck said it was 
  now up to the abducted man to come before the SLMM and furnish the information, 
  explaining that they could not proceed further without the necessary evidence. 
  &quot;We are anxious to have a talk with him and to hear what his experiences 
  were,&quot; he noted. &quot;We want to know whether he was released conditionally.&quot;<br>
  He said the man appeared worried about meeting the SLMM.(NW) </p>
<h3><a name="ba"></a>Civilians of Ampara-Batticaloa complain to Norway about LTTE 
  extortion in East/The Island 25/4/2002</h3>
<p>By a Special Corr.</p>
<p>An organization set up recently to safeguard the human rights of Eastern Province 
  Tamils has complained to Norway, the country facilitating the ceasefire between 
  the Government and Tigers about the extortion conducted by the LTTE in the Batticaloa 
  and Ampara districts against innocent Tamil civilians.</p>
<p>The newly constituted Batticaloa-Ampara Civil Liberties Association (BACLA) 
  has written to Oslo's Ambassador in Colombo Jon Westborg and the Norwegian Head 
  of the Ceasefire Monitoring Mission Major General Trond Furhovde about a series 
  of extortion activities done by the Tamil Tiger organization in <a href="#ba">t</a>he 
  towns of Batticaloa and Karaitivu.</p>
<p>The BACLA has pointed out that the LTTE has stepped up its extortion campaign 
  in the past weeks in Batticaloa and Karaitivu because these are the largest 
  two Tamil majority towns in the districts of Batticaloa and Ampara respectively.</p>
<p>In addition the LTTE has also begun spreading its extortion activity in other 
  parts of the East coming under the control of the security forces also.</p>
<p>Extortion notes</p>
<p>The Tigers who had been sending extortion notes from their offices across the 
  Batticaloa lagoon earlier are now moving about freely in Govt. controlled areas 
  because of the ceasefire.</p>
<p>This has resulted in the Tigers being able to go straight to houses or directly 
  summon people to threaten and demand money described as taxes or donations.</p>
<p>The LTTE says that the Tamil people who have not paid any money for several 
  years because they were living in Government areas in the past must now pay 
  their dues with penalties for not paying earlier.</p>
<p>Prominent citizents, professionals and business people are being forced to 
  pay money under different arrangements for different people.</p>
<p>Leader</p>
<p>Since the LTTE leader Velupillai Prabakharan has promised Muslim Congress Minister 
  Rauff Hakeem that Muslim people will not be taxed, the BACLA fears that the 
  Tigers are now targeting Tamil people in large scale to cover the losses incurred 
  by not taxing Muslims.</p>
<p>LTTE leader Athiyaman is in charge of extortion for the LTTE in the East says 
  the BACLA.</p>
<p>People are being abducted by gangs without any visible links to the LTTE and 
  then being taken to Tiger camps in the Western interior called Paduvangarai 
  alleges the BACLA.</p>
<p>Relatives then go to the camps meet Athiyaman or his assistants and come to 
  an arrangement to pay money in instalments and get the abducted people released 
  on guarantee of payment.</p>
<p>&quot;There are nearly a hundred civilians being kept in forced captivity for 
  extortion purposes at any given time&quot; charges the BACLA.</p>
<p>Some others agree to pay immediately to avoid being abducted.</p>
<p>Many others have not gone to LTTE camps after receiving notes but are living 
  in dreadful fear says the BACLA.</p>
<p>Some have gone into hiding in the East itself while others have moved to Colombo 
  and other Sinhala areas in fear of LTTE it is said.</p>
<p>The BACLA has pointed out that by targeting professionals particularly leading 
  lawyers the LTTE has put &quot;fear&quot; into the Eastern Tamil elite which 
  would in normal situations help the public to oppose such extortion acts.</p>
<p>The Tamil lawyers being specifically targeted has made that breed quiet and 
  passive without opposing such extortion or helping victims.</p>
<p>30 million</p>
<p>At least 30 million rupees have been extorted in Batticaloa and Ampara after 
  the ceasefire. The amounts will in the future run into crores because many people 
  have agreed to pay in instalment and also on regular monthly basis, points out 
  the BACLA.</p>
<p>The ceasefire monitoring panels in both Ampara and Batticaloa districts have 
  not started functioning effectively for the public to complain.</p>
<p>The Tamil public is not confident about the local ceasefire panels being able 
  to do anything solid because it feels that the government and Norway will not 
  be concerned about Tamils being victimized by the LTTE.</p>
<p>If Muslims and Sinhalese are affected there will be agitation but not about 
  Tamil victims of the Tigers, points out the BACLA.</p>
<p>The Tamil people are also worried about complaining to the ceasefire monitors 
  because there are Tiger representatives also included in it. The people are 
  afraid that their identities will be leaked to the LTTE by their stooges, says 
  the BACLA.</p>
<p>The Tamil National Alliance MP's elected from the East are useless and will 
  not help the people who elected them because they are &quot;shameless slaves 
  of the Tigers and have no honesty dignity or self-respect&quot;, states the 
  BACLA.</p>
<p>The BACLA says that the government and international community are cautious 
  in dealing with the LTTE because they don't want to disrupt the ceasefire.</p>
<p>While the peace process should not be ended the BACLA urges that Tamil civilian 
  rights should not be &quot;sacrificed on the altar of the peace process&quot;.</p>
<p>International Community</p>
<p>Therefore the international community represented by Norway as facilitator 
  should act fast and get the LTTE to stop this extortion pleads the BACLA.</p>
<p>&quot;Please control the LTTE if you cannot do so and if the LTTE wants more 
  money then please get it from the USA and give it to them but don't allow the 
  Tigers to bleed the Tamils to death. We beg you for this arrangement&quot; requests 
  the BACLA.</p>
<p>The BACLA also says that apart from demanding money or gold the LTTE is also 
  forcing Tamil people to legally transfer their property like houses and paddy 
  lands etc in the names of people proposed by the Tigers.</p>
<p>&quot;These people are &quot;Benami&quot; or front people for the LTTE and 
  real control is in Tiger hands&quot;, discloses the BACLA.</p>
<p>The organization has also mentioned specific instances of victimisation in 
  Batticaloa and Karaitivu promising to regularly supply more names and facts 
  if Norway will really do something purposeful.</p>
<p>&quot;Please inquire into these cases and find out the truth and take action. 
  If you are unable to check or even control the LTTE then please give up your 
  so called peace process because the ceasefire will in the future be a licence 
  for Tiger extortion of Tamils&quot;, says the BACLA.</p>
<p>If Norway, the government and the international community will genuinely take 
  meaningful action more and more people will come forward to complain against 
  the LTTE says the BACLA. &quot;If nothing is done then most Tamils will suffer 
  in silence leaving organizations like us to represent matters&quot;, it points 
  out.</p>
<p>Incidents</p>
<p>Some excerpts of incidents of extortion cited in Alphabetical order by the 
  BACLA to Norway are as follows:</p>
<p>* Chinniah DC a lawyer from Batticaloa was also summoned to Ambilanthurai. 
  He promptly went there without any delay and met Athiyaman. This was praised 
  by Athiyaman as a worthy example and because of Chinniah's action he was asked 
  to pay only three lakhs of rupees.</p>
<p>* Parasuraman an ayurvedic doctor from Karaitivu was abducted and a demand 
  of Rs. 25 lakhs ransom was made. He fell sick in the LTTE camp and was allowed 
  to return home. But his wife was taken and kept in the Tiger camp in his place. 
  Later a sum of ten lakhs was given and the rest promised in instalments to get 
  Mrs. Parasuraman released.</p>
<p>* Rajendran a jail guard and his wife a school teacher are residents of Puliyantivu 
  in Batticaloa town. Demands were made of them and now an agreement is in force

  SLMM meets LTTE Daily News/ 30/4/2002</h3>
<p>by Douglas Ayling </p>
<p><br>
  Representatives of the Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission (SLMM) met with LTTE leaders 
  yesterday to discuss the abduction of the 82 year old Notary Public, Mr Sithamparapillai. 
  Mr Sithamparapillai was detained for the second time in a fortnight last Friday 
  as he visited the LTTE office in Paddiruppu to pay a ransom instalment pertaining 
  to his first abduction. <br>
  Mr Sithamparapillai, from Thamaraikerny in Batticaloa, was originally taken 
  by force from outside his house on April 15th. He was bundled into an LTTE vehicle 
  when men seized him as he was gardening. In a subsequent phone call from a man 
  identifying himself as an LTTE leader named Kannan, the victim's family was 
  asked to pay a Rs 2.5 million ransom for the official's release. <br>
  The family was informed that he was being held by the LTTE Eastern Province 
  Chief Karikalan. <br>
  Whilst Sithamparapillai was later released from Paddiruppu on condition that 
  the ransom be paid in instalments, he has since been re-detained in the act 
  of delivering his first instalment of Rs 300,000. Mr Sithamparapillai, Notary 
  in Batticaloa, is also father of the well-known Canadian lawyer Kumar S. Sri 
  Skanda. <br>
  Asked what powers are available to the SLMM under the Ceasefire Agreement to 
  stop or censure violations of the MoU, Mr Haukland, Deputy Head of Mission said: 
  &quot;The only power we have is to strongly recommend to settle the problem 
  by peaceful means; and also to come up with recommendations if they want it&quot;. 
  <br>
  Haukland was not prepared to comment on the progress of yesterday's discussions. 
  Asked whether there was any indication that this abduction was a reprisal, Haukland 
  replied &quot;I'm not quite sure because this is the second time this person 
  has been abducted&quot;. <br>
  Since the MoU, there have been 190 complaints reported to the SLMM - according 
  to Haukland, &quot;The majority from the Government side&quot;. </p>
<h3>Fear stalks Batticaloa </h3>
<p>By Nirupama Subramanian, The Hindu<br>
  BATTICALOA, Feb. 26. Sri Lanka is euphoric about the ceasefire between the Government 
  and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), but to this eastern town, it 
  has brought no peace of mind. <br>
  The LTTE controls large swathes of territory in the region and walks in and 
  out of the Government-controlled areas with ease because there is no well-defined 
  &quot;line of control''. <br>
  Last December, when both sides began an informal ceasefire, the LTTE began recruiting 
  teenagers from the district, taking away underage children forcibly, and also 
  intensified its &quot;tax'' collection. Now, with a formal ceasefire in place, 
  there is fear and uncertainty at the prospect of the LTTE being allowed to roam 
  freely in all areas within a few weeks, as specified under the agreement. ``We 
  have mixed feelings about the ceasefire,'' one man, whose business partner fled 
  town after the LTTE asked him to pay up Rs. 15 lakhs, said diplomatically. <br>
  Before the truce, people complained about military checkpoints. Now, for the 
  first time in several years, people are able to move around freely even at night, 
  but ironically, they are asking where the security forces have disappeared. 
  ``If the army would only check people's bags, at least we can give the LTTE 
  the excuse that we cannot carry the money to them as we would be detected by 
  soldiers,'' one man, who has been issued several demand notes, said somewhat 
  desperately. <br>
  The LTTE tax collectors seem to have every detail about the income of their 
  targets: salaries, bank balances, assets, liabilities. Those singled out have 
  to visit the LTTE office in nearby Kokaddicholai. They can bring down the amount 
  they have to pay by bargaining. Refusal to pay usually brings imprisonment till 
  the person is worn down into accepting his fate. <br>
  A government official took voluntary retirement from her job last December, 
  four years ahead of time, in order to move out of the area where she was posted 
  to escape harassment from the &quot;tax squad'' of the LTTE. Now she fears they 
  will be able to get to her only too easily and punish her. A clause in the ceasefire 
  agreement for the protection of civilians from extortion, abduction, intimidation 
  and other harassment has brought no comfort to her. The Tigers have abducted 
  several &quot;tax offenders'' until they pay up. <br>
  Fears are rising that when they are allowed into the town, the LTTE will step 
  up recruitment, which people said had eased off in the first few days of the 
  ceasefire. Over the last three months, the LTTE is believed to have recruited 
  as many as 200 teenagers, including underage children, mainly from areas under 
  its control, demanding one child from each family. Several families that fled 
  to Government-controlled areas to escape the conscription now dread being found 
  by the LTTE and punished. Children who were daring enough to escape from LTTE 
  camps and are still getting over the trauma, are panicking that their captors 
  might return. <br>
  The Hindu spoke to several such children. One of them, an 18-year-old boy, said 
  he was leaving for a Sinhalese village outside the north-east where the LTTE 
  could not find him. The LTTE had taken his mother captive after his escape. 
  The boy hoped they would release her once they realised he had gone for good. 
  <br>
  A 15-year-old boy, who was taken away by two LTTE cadres as he came out of classes 
  escaped on a bicycle from a camp where he was kept for three days. After two 
  hours of frantic pedalling, he managed to reach a main road where he flagged 
  down the first vehicle he saw. The occupants took him to the nearest police 
  station and he was re-united with his family a few hours later. Now the boy 
  is scared at the thought of stepping out again. <br>
  It is an open secret here that a recently-elected Member of Parliament attempted 
  suicide by consuming poison when his son was taken away by the LTTE, and had 
  to be hospitalised for three days. But that did not bring his child back. <br>
  Even those who are otherwise ardent supporters of the LTTE say they are ashamed 
  at its conduct over the last few months. ``The LTTE has undoubtedly created 
  a lot of resentment with its activities,'' said one eminent townsman who has 
  close contact with the area leader of the Tigers, Sivagnyanam Karikalan. <br>
  But there are also those who justify the recruitment and &quot;collection'' 
  of money as necessary to strengthen the LTTE.<br>
