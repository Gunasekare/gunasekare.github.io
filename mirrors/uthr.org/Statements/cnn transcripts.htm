<p>CHANDRIKA KUMARATUNGA, PRESIDENT OF SRI LANKA: Terror will not be the solution 
  to anything that is great, noble, or good.</p>
<p>ZAIN VERJEE, CNN ANCHOR (voice-over): Chandrika Kumaratunga, Sri Lanka's president 
  grapples with the brutal ethnic conflict that has lasted almost 20 years. The 
  president herself has been a victim of the Tamil Tiger rebels.</p>
<p>KUMARATUNGA: They are an organization, you mustn't forget, that is born and 
  bred and fed and live on violence.</p>
<p>VERJEE: She promised peace when she came to power. Why hasn't that happened, 
  and has the war destroyed the country?</p>
<p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The whole system seems to be breaking down, and the war 
  is taking its toll on this country.</p>
<p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Even if Sri Lanka wants to change...</p>
<p>VERJEE: On Q&amp;A, Sri Lanka's President Chandrika Kumaratunga.</p>
<p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p>
<p>VERJEE: Hi, and welcome to Q&amp;A and to our continuing coverage of the &quot;Strike 
  Against Terror.&quot; President Kumaratunga joins us now from our studios in 
  London. Madam President, thank you for appearing on the program. It's so, so 
  good to have you with us. </p>
<p>Let me start by asking you how do you think the United States is handling its 
  war on terror?</p>
<p>KUMARATUNGA: Well, it's not for me to comment, but what I would like to say 
  is that after the horrendous strikes that occurred in the United States on the 
  11th of September, the sovereign of America had to react with military force 
  at the outset. But what I would like to underline as the head of state of a 
  country which has suffered from terrorism for nearly two decades is that with 
  terrorism or insurrections, one cannot find the final solution to it with the 
  force of the state alone.</p>
<p>VERJEE: So, what are the other elements?</p>
<p>KUMARATUNGA: We have to seek out -- we have to seek out the basic causes, the 
  root causes, as we say, which would have given rise to these terrorist movements 
  and find solutions for those. In each case, the causes may be different. They 
  may be very complex, but we have to seek out those causes and find solutions 
  to them. If not, you may kill one bin Laden, but there may be many other bin 
  Ladens that may come up, fighting for the same so-called cause.</p>
<p>VERJEE: You have been quoted as saying the attacks on America have given &quot;a 
  wake-up call to end its double standards on terrorism.&quot; What did you mean 
  by that?</p>
<p>KUMARATUNGA: I think you have put two sentences I said in two different contexts 
  together. It wasn't quite that I said but I...</p>
<p>VERJEE: It was -- it was quoted that way in the &quot;LA Times.&quot;</p>
<p>KUMARATUNGA: I did certainly say that it was -- yes, well, they've taken out 
  long speech I made and put it together. But I did say it was a wake-up call. 
  The bit about double standards was not part of that. Wake- up call to the West, 
  especially the rich nations of the Western world, to take heed of what we in 
  the Third World countries had been suffering for several decades, in my country 
  too, and in others, a little bit more, through the actions of terrorist movements.</p>
<p>And most of these terrorist movements feed themselves financially, if not in 
  any other way, on the rich nations. They have their people collecting funds 
  in the rich nations, and they buy their arms and everything else to carry on 
  their activities in our countries. And for a long time, we have been requesting 
  the developed nations to take effective action to prevent these illegal fund 
  collections.</p>
<p>And we felt that not enough was done. We were told that as long as those organizations 
  do not engage in criminal activities in your nations, that nothing can be done. 
  But I am happy to note that in the last one year, that the United States of 
  America -- really two to three years ago -- Britain, several months ago have 
  prescribed our own brand of terrorists, the LTTE. And they are now beginning 
  to investigate the illegal methods of fund collection that are going on in these 
  countries that...</p>
<p>VERJEE: And so Madam President, if you'd excuse me for interrupting, would 
  you want the global War on Terrorism to be expanded to the Tamil Tiger rebels, 
  in Sri Lanka?</p>
<p>KUMARATUNGA: Well, certainly not the global war. We wouldn't want the areas 
  held by the Tamil Tigers bombarded from wherever, but we would certainly expect 
  and like the Western countries, where the Tamil Tigers are forcing innocent 
  Tamil civilians who are living and working to pay them $10 per month, and if 
  they don't, they attack them physically; they kill some of them. In Paris, they 
  killed a mother, the child of a lady who refused to give money -- we would expect 
  these countries to help us prevent that kind of thing, which is the fount of 
  the terrorist movements in Sri Lanka. And...</p>
<p>VERJEE: Madam President, when you came to power, you promised that you would 
  deliver peace with the Tamil Tigers. Why didn't you deliver?</p>
<p>KUMARATUNGA: We have tried very hard to deliver that peace. We lifted the economic 
  embargoes which were placed by the previous government. We stopped attacks on 
  innocent Tamil people by government-organized mafia, which happened every year 
  under the last government during their 17-year rule. We have brought in all 
  kinds of institutions and arrangements to guarantee safety of person and property 
  to the Tamil people. We have brought in various laws, practices, committees, 
  commissions, which ensure this. We have prevented...</p>
<p>VERJEE: And Madam, all those laws and practices and commissions and all the 
  institutions that you pointed out right now have all been working toward one 
  of your strategies, where you have termed it as being &quot;peace through war&quot;; 
  but you've not been able to defeat the Tamil Tigers militarily, and your constitutional 
  efforts have failed. So, what can people expect from you?</p>
<p>KUMARATUNGA: No, we did not talk about peace through war. We called it a battle 
  for peace. We wanted peace through peace. As we came in, I wrote as head of 
  the Sri Lankan state to the leader of the terrorists, Mr. Prabhakaran, inviting 
  the Tamil Tigers for talks. I threw all protocol out of the window, and as a 
  head of a democratically elected government, I wrote to the self-appointed head 
  of the terrorists.</p>
<p>They did accept my invitation at the beginning; that was part of the beginning 
  of our peace process. We talked to them for eight months, with a cease-fire 
  which was proposed by us; but they refused, right through those eight months, 
  to talk of any constructive solution to the Tamil people's problems, that the 
  Tigers are saying they want to liberate.</p>
<p>We had propositions on the table. We said let's discuss this or anything else 
  that you want to suggest. Anything short of a separate state, we said, we're 
  willing to discuss -- wide devolution of political powers and administrative 
  powers to the region where the Tamil and Muslim people live -- but they refused 
  to discuss any of that, and they started...</p>
<p>VERJEE: But President Kumaratunga, you're painting a picture that the Tamil 
  Tigers are completely to blame here, and you and your government really is not 
  to blame at all. But some of your critics will say that really it was your government 
  that was impeding the efforts by Norway, for instance, to broker some sort of 
  peace, and you really put a stop on that process. Your response?</p>
<p>KUMARATUNGA: I don't know who has informed you of that, but I would have expected 
  you to brief yourself slightly more factually correct. It is my government and 
  I who invited the Norwegian government to come in...</p>
<p>VERJEE: But weren't you afraid that Norway as was being biased toward the Tamil 
  Tigers?</p>
<p>KUMARATUNGA: Not at all. Not at all. Who told you that? We invited the Norwegian 
  government in March 1999, nearly three years ago, to come in as third-party 
  mediators with the concurrence of the invitation extended by us with the concurrence 
  of the Tigers. The Norwegian government came in from March '99. Now, for nearly 
  three years, they have been discussing with the Tigers to bring them to the 
  negotiation table.</p>
<p>For 20 months, they refused, and finally, in the year 2000, last year -- four 
  days after my government won the second parliamentary election, and also 10 
  months after we had won the second presidential election, they finally said, 
  We'll see what we can do. And then the leader of the LTTE made public pronouncements 
  that he will come for negotiations without any conditions.</p>
<p>The Norwegians were asked by both sides -- by the government and the LTTE -- 
  to draw up a memorandum of understanding, the conditions under which we would 
  start talking. The memorandum was drawn up. Both sides had agreed to it. In 
  the process of agreement, the Tigers put in one condition: They wanted more 
  food and more medicines and fuel sent to the LTTE-controlled areas. Lot of it 
  is sent already under our government, because we have no economic embargo. We 
  sent it at the cost of the government. We feed the Tigers. We give them medicines, 
  and they say...</p>
<p>VERJEE: But hold on ...</p>
<p>KUMARATUNGA: ... then they put in...</p>
<p>VERJEE: If I can just interrupt here -- I am sorry -- for a moment. I just 
  want to raise another point that while you were doing all these things, Human 
  Rights Watch's report for 2001 has criticized your government for the way you 
  treat Tamil civilians in the north and the east of the country. The reports 
  are that they've been discriminated against, there are restrictions on the freedom 
  of the movement, arbitrary arrests, abuse at the hands of government, and army 
  and police imposing forced labor. Could you give me a brief response to that?</p>
<p>KUMARATUNGA: Lot of it is lies. What is that report? By whom is it written?</p>
<p>VERJEE: It's written by Human Rights Watch. It's the 2001 Country Report for 
  Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>KUMARATUNGA: The Human Rights Watch, what is that? I don't know, because the 
  Geneva Convention on Human Rights is the UN Convention, which looks after the 
  human right situations in countries all over the world. And various complaints 
  are made to it by the Tiger organizations, by various organizations that are 
  working for the Tigers. And they have the widest possible supervision, monitoring 
  of what goes on in our country, as in many others. And their reports do not 
  say this. I don't know what this Human Rights Watch is.</p>
<p>VERJEE: It's a London-based organization...</p>
<p>KUMARATUNGA: I do not want...</p>
<p>VERJEE: ...Madam President, but we...</p>
<p>KUMARATUNGA: It could be a Tiger organization. I don't know what it is.</p>
<p>VERJEE: ...a short break...</p>
<p>KUMARATUNGA: I am telling you that...</p>
<p>VERJEE: Go ahead. Go ahead.</p>
<p>KUMARATUNGA: Can I speak?</p>
<p>VERJEE: Please do.</p>
<p>KUMARATUNGA: Yes. These kind of mushroom organizations have all kinds of reports. 
  I am not willing to reply to those, but I would like to refer you to the reports 
  of the Geneva Human Rights Conference to the University Teachers on Human Rights, 
  most of whom are Tamil teachers who had to flee Jaffna because the Tigers were 
  trying to kill them. They're a totally independent nongovernmental organization.</p>
<p>They bring out reports every month or every two months, and they're very appreciative 
  of the fact that my government has been able to completely control the human 
  rights violations, which were massively done under the last government. But 
  I must say there are the exceptions too, because we have in the forces and in 
  the police, people who were trained under the last government where human rights 
  violations were abundant during 17 years of that government's rule.</p>
<p>We have been able to take action against 950 policemen and army personnel who 
  were known to have violated human rights of Sinhalese as well as Tamil people 
  under the last government, but we still have a few people left in the forces 
  who do...</p>
<p>VERJEE: Well, Madam President...</p>
<p>KUMARATUNGA: ... this kind of the exceptionally...</p>
<p>VERJEE: Well, thank you...</p>
<p>KUMARATUNGA: ...and we take action every time we know about it.</p>
<p>VERJEE: We're going to have more with President Chandrika Kumaratunga. We will 
  continue our conversation. You're watching Q&amp;A.</p>
<p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p>
<p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We were talking about a ceasefire just a couple of months 
  ago, and again something delayed this. It puts everything back to square one.</p>
<p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We must see what we can do to safeguard our own country.</p>
<p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The government policy to isolate (INAUDIBLE) of people from 
  the LTTE will never succeed.</p>
<p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<p>VERJEE: Remember, we want to know what you think, while the show is going on. 
  Just log on to cnn.com/q&amp;a and get into the chatroom. </p>
<p>We're taking with the president of Sri Lanka, Mrs. Chandrika Kumaratunga. </p>
<p>Madam president, in recent months, there have been a number of political developments 
  in your country, and some of the criticism that's come out of that is that you 
  have, in fact, taken some very autocratic steps in your country -- suspending 
  parliament, when you knew you couldn't win a confidence motion -- that's been 
  the criticism. Why did you do it?</p>
<p>KUMARATUNGA: We have dissolved parliament. My government won a parliamentary 
  election one year ago with a very clear majority of 18 MPs more in parliament, 
  27 more, in fact -- more than the main opposition party -- and because of some 
  defections -- a lot of it happened, because money changed hands. The government's 
  majority became rather thin, and the prime minister requested me, and I thought 
  he was right in requesting me. To go to the people again and ask the people 
  for their opinion, being a democratic government, we thought it was the most 
  democratic thing to do. I don't see what is autocratic in this.</p>
<p>VERJEE: When you came to power, you pledged to abolish...</p>
<p>KUMARATUNGA: And also...</p>
<p>VERJEE: ... I'd just like to finish my question, Madam President. You came 
  to power and you said, I will abolish the office of the presidency. It gives 
  too much power to one person, and that one person can abuse that power. You 
  promised to give more power to parliament. Why didn't you fulfill that promise?</p>
<p>KUMARATUNGA: Well, I have been trying hard to fulfill that promise for the 
  last seven years. We brought in a new constitution, a new draft of a constitution 
  in less than one year after I came in, which also proposed the abolition of 
  the executive presidency, while also proposing the widest possible devolution 
  to the regions, including the regions where the Tamil and Muslim minorities 
  live. But we did not have the two-thirds majority in parliament. We kept appealing 
  to the opposition to give us that two-thirds majority; we only needed 16 votes 
  more, but they consistently refused.</p>
<p>We discussed this draft constitution with all the parliamentary parties for 
  nearly three years in parliament -- 32 months in parliament -- and then again 
  last year after the people gave me a mandate at the presidential election, the 
  second one, in '99, when I got nearly killed by the Tigers. Once again, for 
  six long months, I discussed with the main opposition parties; 12 out of the 
  14 parties in parliament agreed to our constitutional draft, with the amendments 
  included, of course. But the UNP refused to give us the support, and we have 
  not been able to bring it. I am trying to bring the constitution in, which would 
  also abolish my powers as a president. I would love to go and sit back in parliament. 
  I am told it is being unusual that I would like do away with my own very wide 
  powers that I was given under the last constitution by the last government.</p>
<p>But we are not being allowed to do this by the opposition, which thereafter 
  keeps screaming their heads off that I am autocratic. Yes, I would like to say 
  one little thing here please, that it is beginning to be very tiresome to hear 
  people telling us that we're being autocratic, that we are violating human rights, 
  when my government has stopped -- the last government killed 50,000 Sinhalese 
  democratic youths simply because they did not agree with them. They killed over 
  20,000 Tamil youth. They burnt them alive; they poured petrol on them, and burnt 
  them alive in pogroms against the Tamil people.</p>
<p>We promised the country that we would stop this. We have stopped this; the 
  reign of state terror has been definitely stopped under my government seven 
  years ago, and you do not talk about the violation of human rights by the LTTE. 
  The LTTE violates the human rights of thousands of people that are living under 
  them, thousands of them who keep streaming out of the Tiger-controlled areas 
  into the government-controlled areas, telling the newspaper the horrors they 
  went through.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the LTTE tried to kill my prime minister. They have killed more 
  innocent Tamil civilians. The LTTE has killed more Tamil civilians than all 
  the Sri Lankan governments put together. They have killed all the democratic 
  Tamil leaders. Why don't you talk about the human rights of those people that 
  had been violated?</p>
<p>VERJEE: Madam president, I would like to focus here, though, on your actions 
  in government.</p>
<p>KUMARATUNGA: ... on one side of the story.</p>
<p>VERJEE: No, no. I want to ask you this question. I mean you're blaming the 
  opposition and saying they are screaming their heads off, but what about your 
  actions? Have you alienated your supporters? As you mentioned earlier, some 
  of your Cabinet members have quit, saying that they couldn't defend a corrupt 
  and ineffective government such as the one you run. They say the corruption 
  is the issue here, and not, as you're accusing, of money changing hands. What 
  do you say to them?</p>
<p>KUMARATUNGA: Well, as far as I know, none of them have talked about corruption 
  until now. Three ministers who left; all of them were beginning to be investigated 
  by the authorities for corruption themselves. I sent for them. That is my style 
  of governance. Personally, I told them to stop this kind of activity, but they 
  did not. And the investigations were continuing from the beginning of this year, 
  and they decided to cross over because of that. Up to now, I know of no public 
  statements made by them. </p>
<p>I have been in England now for four days; I don't know whether they have done 
  it since. The only accusation they have made -- and I'm proud to hear that -- 
  is that they have not talked of corruption or any mismanagement of government 
  affairs. They have only said that the president does not discuss sufficiently 
  with them when I take decisions. I have not heard of their saying they left 
  because of corruption. They left because they are being investigated for corruption, 
  and it has to be reported to the people very soon. Rather, it will be reported 
  very soon. </p>
<p>We are a responsible government. I cannot talk of these facts until they are 
  legally established, and they will be indicted before the courts of law. That 
  will happen very fast, from what I hear. And then we can talk about it.</p>
<p>VERJEE: My last question for you, Madam President: Is there anything at all 
  that you would have done differently?</p>
<p>KUMARATUNGA: You mean in my term as president or in my life in general?</p>
<p>VERJEE: In your term as president, not in your life in general.</p>
<p>KUMARATUNGA: It is a so-complicated life, so we will talk about only my term 
  as president. No, I don't think so, except perhaps take stricter action against 
  some of my ministers who have been corrupt and inefficient. Perhaps, I should 
  have sacked them as the people say I should have. Apart from that, we came into 
  power on three major platforms: One was to end the reign of terror which was 
  perpetrated by the state; we have done that and ensure that it will not happen 
  again.</p>
<p>VERJEE: You also came in power saying you'd bring peace, and there would be...</p>
<p>KUMARATUNGA: I'm coming to that. I'm coming to that.</p>
<p>VERJEE: Yes, OK.</p>
<p>KUMARATUNGA: Can you give me half a minute? </p>
<p>The second was that we will rebuild an economy, which was in total shambles. 
  We have done that. It's only the year 2000 that the economy has gotten into 
  trouble, because of the world economic recession, because of a very bad drought 
  we had this year in Sri Lanka. And we are too dependent on hydropower; we had 
  to have power cuts. But until then...</p>
<p>VERJEE: And unemployment is up. Privatization has been slowed down. Tourism 
  is down. Because of the war, people don't have jobs. The economy is in ruins.</p>
<p>KUMARATUNGA: No, that is not true. The economy is not in ruins. I don't know 
  what you mean by the word &quot;ruins,&quot; whether you have a new definition 
  for that word. But we were able to reduce the budget deficit by half since we 
  came in. We were able to reduce unemployment by more than 50 percent. We have 
  increased the gross national production in the country by double, by 100 percent. 
  We have been able to reduce bank interest rates by almost 100 percent: from 
  29 percent to 15 percent to 16 percent.</p>
<p>We have been able to reduce inflation by about 50 percent. We have been able 
  to keep a steady economic growth rate every year, except the last one, at above 
  5 percent. In the last year, it is going down, but that happens even to your 
  countries. You are suffering from an economic recession. The economists will 
  turn out the papers very soon. But we have had six years of very good economic 
  development. We brought up an economy which had no vision, no program of action; 
  rather, fundamentals were all completely in shambles. We have built up a very 
  strong base for the economy.</p>
<p>VERJEE: President Chandrika Kumaratunga, my apologies for interrupting you. 
  We are out of time. Thank you so much for speaking to us on Q&amp;A. We appreciate 
  that. </p>
