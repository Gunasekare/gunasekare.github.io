style='font-size:12.0pt;'>THE MURDER OF REV. ARULPALAN AND THE GOVERNMENT&#146;S 
  DENIAL</span></u></b></h2>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="t"></a>September 1997</b></h2>
<p><b>25<sup>th</sup> August 1997: Killinochchi: The murder of Rev. Arulpalan:</b><span> 
  </span>Going westwards from the Killinochchi bus depot, first comes the army&#146;s 
  defence bund followed by no man&#146;s land for about a stretch of one mile. 
  Murippu which has a farm, Shalom Nagar, owned by the CSI church is a little 
  beyond the bund in no man&#146;s land. When the army took Killinochchi in October 
  last year, most of those in the farm at Murippu moved to Konavil, beyond the 
  LTTE sentry point at the end of no man&#146;s land, and joined Rev. Lawrence 
  at the CSI church there. Incidentally Rev. Lawrence lost his wife when the air 
  force, about New Year 1994, bombed the Chavakacheri town centre near the CSI 
  church, acting on a rumour that the LTTE leader was to unveil a statue of Kittu 
  (LTTE&#146;s former Jaffna commander).</p>
<p><b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Rev. Arulpalan (42)</span></b><span> 
  </span>was transferred from Uduvil and took up his position as the priest in 
  charge at Shalom Nagar farm in April this year. Shalom Nagar includes a church 
  sponsored housing scheme for displaced persons. Although the LTTE had advised 
  civilians not to go into no man&#146;s land, people habitually went into the 
  area to collect produce such as coconuts and palm leaves for building shelter. 
  Poverty and unemployment also spurred people to go into the area to collect 
  produce from abandoned property, building materials by stripping houses, wood 
  work and other items left behind by the owners, for sale. </p>
<p>At Shalom Nagar itself the watcher, <b>Arumugam</b>, and a few labourers continued 
  to reside there. <b>Rev. Arulpalan</b> himself visited the farm regularly. On 
  the day in question (25<sup>th</sup> August) Arulpalan went there with two labourers 
  <b>Milita Joseph (56)</b> and his son <b>Joseph Surendran (16).</b> The purpose 
  was to cut some Palmyrah leaves for the roof of a temporary building being put 
  up in Konavil. While the labourers set about their work, <b>Arulpalan </b>who 
  was down with malaria removed his cassock, folded it, put it aside and lay 
  down under a tree in a pair of shorts. The army seldom came to the farm. But 
  elsewhere in the neighbourhood, troops on patrol outside the bund spotted some 
  youth plucking coconuts and gave them a chase. The youth ran through the farm 
  and gave the slip to the soldiers. The soldiers were evidently very angry. When 
  they spotted Joseph and his son at their work, they summoned them along with 
  <b>Arulpalan</b>. The watcher <b>Arumugam</b> and the other labourers who are 
  eye witnesses to this got away from the area unknown to the army. From that 
  day <b>Arulpalan</b> and the two labourers were missing. </p>
<p>Arulpalan&#146;s colleague <b>Rev. Lawrence</b> contacted the ICRC on 28<sup>th</sup> 
  August. The church contacted the Defence Ministry on the same date and were 
  told they must have been taken for a routine check. On 9<sup>th</sup> September 
  church members at Konavil hired some youths to go into that area and do a search. 
  They came back bringing along the remains of the three missing persons. The 
  bodies had been found in the kitchen of one of the houses in the Shalom Nagar 
  scheme.</p>
<p>The three items given below are relevant:</p>
<p><span></span>When the news of the murdered priest appeared in the Island of 
  16<sup>th</sup> September, the following appeared at the end: &#147;&#133;.a 
  security forces spokesman said that many terrorists had been ambushed by troops 
  operating in the Paranthan-Killinochchi areas in the recent past. The area remains 
  closed to ordinary civilians&#133;.terrorists move in civilian clothes to monitor 
  defences&#133;.&#148;</p>
<p><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In the interview given to the 
  Sunday Island ( 5<sup>th</sup> October) the ICRC head <b>Gerard Peytrignet</b> 
  said, &#147;There is also a problem in Killinochchi. Many cross from the Vanni 
  at this point. There are reports of high numbers arrested and not seen and those 
  considered to be infiltrators are shot. There are no civilians in the area. 
  Therefore those found are often considered to be infiltrators&#148;.</span></p>
<p><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The Uthayan<u> </u>of 18<sup>th</sup> 
  September reported that two displaced high school students who went to view 
  their houses in the Nedunkerni area (taken by the army in June 1997) were detained 
  by the army (7/9). They were handed over to the Kebitigollawa Police and were 
  released on bail at the Anuradapura magistrate&#146;s court on 17<sup>th</sup> 
  September.</span></p>
<p><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Responding to the publicity evoked 
  by the priest&#146;s murder, the Ministry of Defence issued a denial on 2<sup>nd</sup> 
  October which contained the following : &#147; The Security Coordinating Officer 
  Jaffna, and the DIG Jaffna who inquired into the death of <b>Rev. Arulpalan</b>&#133;&#133;&#133;&#133; 
  have revealed that the priest had not been taken into custody by any unit of 
  the security forces under any circumstances. Further, the church is situated 
  outside the boundaries of the area cleared by the armed forces which is not 
  accessible to service personnel&#133;&#133;&#133;.accordingly, all evidence 
  shows that the death of <b>Rev. Arulpalan</b>&#133;&#133;&#133;.could probably 
  be a result of an act of the LTTE with the intention of bringing discredit to 
  the armed forces&#133;&#133;.&#148;</span></p>
<p>The foregoing however suggests that the claims in this statement are not borne 
  out by known facts. The facts surrounding the murder presented by us are based 
  on well authenticated information provided by local sources. The injuries on 
  the corpse of <b>Rev. Arulpalan</b> showed that he had been shot . Three fingers 
  had been missing from his left hand owing to a festival accident with handling 
  of crackers in his childhood. The killers had cut off this hand and removed 
  it. The two labourers, father and son, had been hacked to death. Only a few 
  bones remained from the father&#146;s body, the flesh evidently having been 
  eaten by jungle animals or stray dogs. The head of the son had been severed 
  and placed between the legs. The two labourers who had earlier lived in the 
  South were of Malayali origin and were fluent in Sinhalese. <b>Rev. Arulpalan</b> 
  too knew some Sinhalese. There is no doubt that the soldiers who arrested them 
  had been told that <b>Arulpalan </b>was the priest of the church. </p>
<p><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><br>
  Civilian sources in the area also said that about twenty persons who went into 
  `no man&#146;s land&#146; are missing. Twelve of them are said to have been 
  taken into custody by the security forces earlier. The people were confident 
  that they were alive but are now losing hope because nothing more has been heard. 
  One person who, according to local reports, was taken into custody and had returned 
  is a postal peon. When he told the army the work he was doing he was sent to 
  Jaffna and asked to work in the Jaffna post office. He later found his way back 
  home. Before the incident involving <b>Arulpalan</b> two civilians are said 
  to have been stabbed to death in `no man&#146;s land&#146;. However people continue 
  to go into the area as much as they did before. </span></p>
<p>All these serve to indicate that a serious problem of civilian security exists 
  in the area that stems from armed forces&#146; activity. If the import of the 
  Ministry of Defence&#146;s statement is that the government is dodging the 
  issue, it is most unbecoming and reprehensible.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>All available evidence strongly indicates that the murder 
  of <b>Rev. Arulpalan</b> and the two labourers was committed by members of the 
  security forces. The absurd denial by the Ministry of Defence only shows that 
  they have learned nothing from their handling of such matters from the &#145;80s 
  which taught people to attach little credibility to statements and stated intentions 
  of the government. The authorities owe it to the people to conduct an inquiry 
  into the matter by persons whose credibility is above board.</p>
