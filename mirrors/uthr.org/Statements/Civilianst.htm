<h3 align=center style='text-align:center'>SRI LANKA:CIVILIAN WELL-BEING IN A<br>
   TIME OF WAR: A LOST HOPE?</h3>
<h4 align=center style='text-align:center'>(A STATEMENT ISSUED BY THE UNIVERSITY 
  TEACHERS FOR HUMAN RIGHTS (JAFFNA) ON 10TH OCTOBER <i>1995)</i></h4>
<p>The events in Vadamaratchi, Jaffna, on Friday 22nd September, had been widely 
  reported except in this country. In the worst incident more tan 30 school children 
  were killed when the Sri Lankan Air Force Mopped bombs in the vicinity of the 
  school in Nagar-kovil. The incident rook place about 12 hours after the Government 
  imposed press censor­ship on reporting military events.</p>
<p>Two days before, Sea Tigers attacked a supply ship returning from KKS and its 
  naval escort. Although the Government claimed that the ship Muditha and a Dvora 
  craft were damaged, the LTT&#146;E claimed that the latter had been sunk. On 
  the 22nd morning the LTTE was moving the hijacked passenger vessel Irish Moana 
  which was then close to Nagar­kavil according to local sources. Shelling had 
  also commenced that morning from the Army base at Palaly, 15 miles away.</p>
<p>Seeing bomber activity overhead the principal and staff of Nagar­kovil Government 
  School were in a dilemma about what to do with the pupiis.In the prevailing 
  state of anxiety no clear decision was taken. When the Junior School broke at 
  12 noon, the children began moving home and the senior boys remained. In the 
  meantime a commemoration relay fast was taking place all over Jaffna for Thileepan 
  (who went on a &#147;rotest death fast during 1987). There was also a pandal 
  (decorative tent) near the school over which the bombers had been active. Several 
  children</p>
<p>who had come out of school had sheltered under a tree near the pandal waiting 
  for the bombers to leave. At about 12.45pm a bomb fell among the people under 
  the tree, instantly killing 24 children and 15 others. The pandal was said to 
  have been slightly damaged. Several of the corpses were beyond recognition and 
  were identified by their possessions. The injured continued to die on subsequent 
  days bringing the total dead to well over 50.</p>
<p>In the meantime sporadic shelling had also been taking a large number of civilian 
  lives. On the 22nd itself a shell fell on a house in Savanai, Thumpalai, along 
  Vallipurakovil road going east from Pt Pedro to Kudathanai and Nagarkovil. Upon 
  hearing bomber activity the mother asked her four children (14 years and below) 
  to remain indoors and came onto the road to assess the intentions of the Air 
  Force. Just then a shell fifed from Palaly fell on her home killing her four 
  children and a child next door.</p>
<p>The pattern of shelling, which continued for a week, was such that it took 
  place about four times a day and at any hour, at least six shells at a time. 
  They were fired into the Vadamaratchi area at random and were no doubt intended 
  to vent the anger of the Forces on civilians.</p>
<p>With the commencement of &#145;Operation Thunderstrike&#146; on 1st Octo­ber 
  around the Atchuvely area, there was shelling into areas near Nelliady, Irupalai, 
  Kopay and other areas closer to Jaffna town, all some way from the operational 
  area. In Kondavil ( a mile outsite Jaffna municipal limits) four from a displaced 
  family were killed by shelling. The fact that so many amputations are being 
  performed in hospitals is a reflection of the strain on medical staff and the 
  running down of normal facilities. People of the area praised the MSF for their 
  unstinting service.</p>
<p>After a week of maintaining that the bombing of children at Nagar­kovil was 
  LTTE propaganda, the Defence Spokesman admitted the incident. The first reports 
  had been based on an MSF press release from Paris. The Defence spokesman however 
  said that what had been bombed was an LTTE facility and suggested that several 
  of the dead must have been LTITE cadre.</p>
<p>After the very bad experience of the abortive July military operation, people 
  are not taking chances, and at the least sign of danger are leaving</p>
<p>their homes to trudge along the road towards an area deemed safer carrying 
  their meagre belongings, and then back again a day or two later when some decide 
  that there is no immediate danger. Incidentally, when the Army withdrew from 
  areas which it had captured in July, hundreds of civilians who had remained 
  in those areas were harassed by the LTTE and a few were arrested by them as 
  suspected Army informers. The reality</p>
<p>is that a large number of poor people do not have any other place to go to 
  during Army incursions.</p>
<p>The firing of shells into the Methodist Mission compound in Puttur, which is 
  since late under Army control is also a cause for further concern.The shells 
  that were fired in the early hours of 9th October fell on the mission hospital 
  now housing old folk, killing nine inmates. If these had been fired by the LTTE 
  as claimed by the Government, it places the civilians in a difficult dilemma 
  when the Army advances. The LTTE has been since July warning civilians not to 
  remain in areas which the Army would bring under its control. The dilemma would 
  become worse as the Army now 7 miles away <i>( </i>with a two mile strip of 
  no-man&#146;s land) nears Jaffna. With the oncoming rains, the situation could 
  become intolerable for the civilians. Even if the Army takes a monsoon break 
  merely confining itself to shelling, it will be torture for the civilians.</p>
<p>The Government&#146;s conduct on the question of accountability in war is reprehensible 
  and is hardly different form that of the last Government. The main effect of 
  the censorship has been to keep the people of this country in the dark about 
  the sufferings of a particular section of its citizenry. Although the mainline 
  press had rarely come out with factual information regarding civilian life in 
  the war-tom North-East, there had been some openings in recent times to write 
  about the people. By imposing censorship the Government has been seen to be 
  more con­cerned about the public coming to know about the ugly events for which 
  n must take responsibility, rather than about preventive and disciplinary measures 
  to minimise civilian suffering.</p>
<p>The food and medical situation is now rapidly deteriorating in the North.The 
  LTTE in its own predictable manner is not prepared to take any responsiblity 
  for the well- being of the people. Its refusal to reopen the Elephant Pass or 
  Pooneryn, land routes together with its Sea Tiger</p>
<p>attacks on ships near KKS harbour, are symptoms of its total disregard for 
  civilian interests. To the LTTE, commemoration meetings and public gatherings 
  have been a &#145;Heads I win, Tails you lose&#146; proposition. The Government, 
  whose Air Force observes these gatherings from the air sees them as a provocation. 
  Similarly when the tortuous sea borne supply of food from the Government does 
  not reach the people of Jaffna in time, the LTTE&#146;s campaign on it by crying 
  genocide. If the people are on the other hand provided with adequate food by 
  the Government, the LTTE then boast that they are running the civilian administration 
  efficiently. But it is the Government&#146;s duty to ensure that they have their 
  own agenda reflecting concern for their own people. It is this concern that 
  would save them from playing to the LTTE&#146;s agenda.</p>
<p>With both sides now conducting themselves with few inhibitions regarding civilian 
  causalities, the plight of the civilians remains unenviable.<a href="#top">[Top]</a><br>
