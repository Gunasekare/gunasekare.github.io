<h3><a name="_Toc83561131"></a><a name="_Toc83561178">Shrivelled Entities</a></h3>
<p>The twin tragedies we are now witnessing, the LTTE&#146;s murder of Tamil dissidents 
  and its unyielding conscription of children, evoke an atmosphere reminiscent 
  of Jaffna when the LTTE cut short Rajani&#146;s Thiranagama&#146;s life on 21<sup>st</sup> 
  September 1989. In both instances, the LTTE&#146;s actions were a symptom of 
  weakness, mistaken by others for strength. Indeed, it has a fortune invested 
  in five continents, a substantial fleet of vessels plying the oceans on legal 
  as well as covert pursuits. But yet it feels vulnerable to mere individuals 
  who question its political goals and means. It fears they will eventually rekindle 
  life in the community and threaten their grip. Against this reality, it is also 
  the fickleness of the Southern polity that sustains the LTTE. </p>
<p>As we have seen, in both 1990 and today the Sinhalese polity could have prevented 
  bloodshed and anarchy, had it challenged the LTTE by conceding the legitimate 
  rights of the Tamil people without reserve and through practical measures. Instead, 
  it appeased the LTTE, talked grudgingly about Tamil grievances and treated the 
  fate of Tamil dissent with frivolous disregard.</p>
<p>During the past two years the concept of a Sri Lankan State and nation, has 
  shrivelled to a point where Sri Lanka&#146;s leaders no longer even pretend 
  to be take responsibility for the island&#146;s North-Eastern citizens. Instead 
  they downplay abuses against them, talking and acting as though the LTTE&#146;s 
  killing of Tamil dissidents and the crude and brutal conscription of rural Tamil 
  children &#145;are no obstacle to the peace process&#146;.</p>
<p>Civil society has been another casualty. 15 years ago Tamils who cared about 
  democracy and human rights found common cause with groups in the South, a number 
  of them with real grassroots contacts, which had been through a bloody insurgency 
  themselves. By 2000, most of these groups were rooted in Colombo, had aligned 
  themselves with their international donors, and were caught up in appeasing 
  the LTTE along with the international community. The prevailing attitude among 
  Colombo&#146;s NGOs was that democracy was a luxury Sri Lanka&#146;s Tamils 
  could not afford. In consequence Tamil dissent became doubly imperilled and 
  its voices silenced throughout the island.</p>
<p>Although the LTTE is weak, the leaders of the two main parties, lacking direction 
  or conviction, are almost entirely preoccupied with tripping each other. They 
  therefore see dealings with the LTTE largely within this framework, and courted 
  the LTTE-controlled Tamil National Alliance, oblivious even to the short-term 
  dangers. Meanwhile, the LTTE lobbies scored points by drawing attention to 
  the Southern polity&#146;s inability to move on federalism, language rights 
  or even to pay compensation to the longsuffering victims of the 1977 and 1983 
  communal violence. Any prospect of the Government or anyone else of influence 
  lobbying on behalf of the people of Sri Lanka seemed to become ever more remote. 
</p>
<p>Tamil democrats have had few allies they could consistently rely on. A few 
  courageous individuals in the South have continued to actively support those 
  resisting the menace of child conscription, and have spoken out on unpalatable 
  truths through the media. However, Tamils striving for democracy and human rights 
  for their community, will be for sometime constrained by their own resources. 
  This is a lesson that should have been learnt in 1990.<a href="#top">[Top]</a></p>
<h3><a name="_Toc83561132"></a><a name="_Toc83561179">The Chequered Story of Tamil 
  Dissent</a></h3>
<p>To be identified as a Tamil dissident against fascist terror is not a mark 
  of sainthood. And attempting to make such an attribution does the recipient 
  a disservice, since once the LTTE murders its critics (and often even before 
  the death sentence is carried out), its lobbies attack them precisely for not 
  being saints. It is a red herring designed to distract attention from the real 
  achievements of dissidents. </p>
<p>In fact all Tamil dissidents are products of the same rotten society that gave 
  birth to the LTTE and its bloodstained politics. The worst elements are not 
  those who handled a gun, but those who took vicarious pleasure in murder and 
  justified it. How many in this society did not find some quiet satisfaction 
  in the 1985 Anuradhapura massacre of Buddhist pilgrims? There were of course 
  good souls among the ordinary folk who were horrified and had no illusions about 
  what the agent of the deed would ultimately do to Tamils themselves.</p>
<p>Dissidents were often persons who had flirted with the mainstream of a decadent 
  Tamil nationalism, and had their hands dirtied in its cause. Others, whose political 
  convictions gave them far greater clarity about the malign trends in Tamil nationalism, 
  dirtied their hands protecting themselves from the LTTE&#146;s murderous wrath. 
  Through experience and crises in their lives, many of them came to a point where 
  they were horrified with what they had been associated with. Where they had 
  opportunity and time for reflection, they put themselves on the line and took 
  the position that the Tamil people could regain their freedom and dignity only 
  through a commitment to the higher values of democracy and human rights. Rajani 
  was one in a long line of such persons.</p>
<p>For hundreds of these dissidents there was no turning back, even when death 
  was staring them in the face. How hard it was, and what enormous resources of 
  character and conviction it demanded is seen vividly in the dreadful transformation 
  the LTTE wrought on several of the dissidents&#146; colleagues. </p>
<p>The LTTE realised in the late 1990s that to convince sympathetic sections of 
  the international community to back its claim to be the sole representatives 
  of the people, it had to go beyond simply killing off its opponents. It had 
  to transform and co-opt them -- at least for the time being. The transformation 
  the LTTE achieved through terror took advantage of the Tamil community&#146;s 
  weakness, and the crass villainy and cowardice that lurked beneath the gloss 
  of Tamil nationalism. The Tamil National Alliance, which the LTTE forged as 
  its parliamentary arm brought together the rumps of a number of groups, including 
  the TULF, whose ranks had been thinned over the years by the steady attrition 
  of LTTE assassinations. Even more astounding is the inglorious flip of the TELO 
  led by Addaikkalanathan and the faction of the EPRLF led by Suresh Premachandran. 
</p>
<p>The LTTE massacred their TELO and EPRLF colleagues by the hundreds from 1986. 
  Today Suresh Premachandran and Addaikkalanathan are running units tasked by 
  the LTTE to spot and target dissidents, most of all their former associates. 
  Those who receive warning as potential targets are encouraged to save their 
  lives by becoming agents of the LTTE, aiding the targeting other dissidents 
  whose trust and confidence they enjoy. This is the quintessence of fascism, 
  which must break all trust and cherished values in a community to accomplish 
  its vision of &#145;liberation&#146;. As LTTE leaders have said in the past, 
  the LTTE intelligence wing must ultimately encompass every man, woman and child. 
  Only such a terrified society can yield to child conscription and suicide bombers 
  without protest.</p>
<p>The virulence of this phenomenon cannot be overstated, nor its danger to civilized 
  order. By keeping people in a constant state of acute anxiety, the LTTE has 
  eroded the collective sanity of an entire society. This is the perspective against 
  which the achievement of those who were steadfast in defying this phenomenon 
  should be judged.</p>
<p>Ironically it is just those persons valued for their exceptional decency who 
  after being killed by the LTTE have been singled out for character assassination 
  by its lobbies. Again those in the forefront of character assassination are 
  friends, journalists and intellectuals, transformed after being trembling and 
  shivering LTTE targets.</p>
<p>A recent instance concerns T. Subathiran (Robert), a senior leader of the EPRLF(V) 
  assassinated in 2003. The whispering campaign against him concerns the bad patch 
  his party went through, when cornered by LTTE terror to operate alongside the 
  Indian Army in the late 1980s. If there were any meanness in the man, it would 
  have been aired during the six years before his death when he walked the streets 
  of Jaffna as a vulnerable, unarmed party activist. During this period he was, 
  even by his enemies, respected as an exemplary democrat and a decent human being. 
  A vocally extremist TNA politician was moved to remark upon his assassination, 
  &#147;<i>He was a good boy, but why was he in the EPRLF&#148;!</i></p>
<p>On 16<sup>th</sup> August, Balanadarajah Iyer, a pioneer figure in Tamil student 
  agitation, and a leading figure in his own right, was gunned down by the LTTE 
  in Colombo. Iyer had been a leading member of EROS, which shared a common origin 
  with the EPRLF and EPDP. Many EROS members were unhappy when its leader Balakumar 
  turned the party into an LTTE stooge. Circumstances helped Iyer to come out, 
  and though he could have left the country, he chose to work on the editorial 
  board of EPDP publications instead. Among his contributions was to search out 
  good English articles not available to a Tamil readership, and provide translations.</p>
<p>In reporting the killing the same day, <i>TamilNet, </i>which reflects the 
  LTTE line, made no attempt to dissemble. It stated in English that Iyer was 
  EPDP spokesman, a member of its editorial board and added that &#145;according 
  to the EPDP, Iyer was killed by the LTTE&#146;. On the other hand the LTTE expatriate 
  e-journal <i>Nitharsanam</i> alleged in Tamil that the gunmen who killed Iyer 
  were from the EPDP. It further stated that Iyer was an LTTE informant and played 
  a leading role in the miscarried suicide bomber attack on the EPDP leader Devananda 
  during July. Those who knew Iyer from the early days of the struggle instantly 
  saw this LTTE ploy as a piece of mischief calculated to cheapen the victim&#146;s 
  character and sow confusion about his murder. A further clear indication of 
  the LTTE&#146;s role in the murder came when it sent EROS leader Balakumar to 
  represent it at the Oslo Tamil Sangam, 13 days after the murder of his former 
  deputy. He delivered a formula speech praising the LTTE as brave and intelligent 
  soldiers who defeated in effect a &#145;multinational force&#146;.</p>
<p>Balakumar was a weak leader who believed once that the LTTE boss Prabhakaran, 
  of whom he took a dim view, would blunder himself into extinction, thus giving 
  him clear field. In 1990, he lost faith in his prophecy and surrendered to the 
  LTTE lock, stock and barrel. In Oslo Balakumar did not utter a word about his 
  lately deceased friend and deputy. Balakumar&#146;s mission was to demonstrate 
  to EROS&#146;s support base abroad that Iyer&#146;s murder made no difference 
  to his serving the LTTE. Back in the late 1970s and early 1980s EROS was the 
  first group to build a support base among the expatriate elite.</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc83561133"></a><a name="_Toc83561180">The Role of LTTE Disinformation 
  and Terror</a></h3>
<p>When the LTTE killed Rajani, it arranged the circumstances so that the Indian 
  Army, or rival Tamil groups, would be blamed. When people saw through the deception 
  and started talking about it, the LTTE issued a statement of denial in Jaffna 
  two months later, threatening anti-national elements who cast aspersions on 
  their noble cause. An effort at character assassination against Rajani (for 
  which there was no room locally) took the form of a whisper campaign abroad. 
  But it had very limited success.</p>
<p>Today, the LTTE&#146;s capacity for disinformation is far stronger, and is 
  conducted through several channels. The international community too became complicit, 
  following its identification of the LTTE as the key component of the peace process 
  and became cornered into appeasing and protecting it. By early this year it 
  too had become party to its abuses (our Bulletin No.36.)</p>
<p>The LTTE&#146;s already significant control over the Tamil media (including 
  BBC Tamil Service for good measure) was strengthened further when LTTE hit squads 
  were given a free run of Colombo by the terms of the ceasefire. This also meant 
  that many journalists representing the Tamil media (seen as that of a discriminated 
  people) in international agencies dedicated to &#145;media freedom,&#146; are 
  virtual LTTE nominees.</p>
<p>The rebellion by the LTTE&#146;s Eastern strong man Karuna last March coincided 
  with an upsurge in Tamil opposition to the LTTE, particularly among expatriates. 
  This was followed by internecine killings between the Karuna and Prabhakaran 
  (Vanni) factions of the LTTE. While public appeals to end killing of civilians 
  largely worked with the Karuna faction, the Vanni faction saw the internecine 
  fight as a pretext to attack Tamil opposition in general.</p>
<p>LTTE hit teams targeted unarmed political opponents throughout the country 
  while the Government kept repeating that these killings were no threat to the 
  peace process, and did nothing. Meanwhile Western embassies sent delegations 
  to the Vanni to talk to the LTTE into restarting the peace talks. The LTTE went 
  on pounding them and the SLMM with the message that they were being attacked 
  by anti-peace &#147;paramilitary&#148; elements supported by the Sri Lankan 
  forces. There are indications that this line met with significant success. The 
  SLMM had already set precedents by inventing a third force (pointing absurdly 
  to other Tamil groups) to avoid pointing a finger at the LTTE for particular 
  violations.</p>
<p>On 21st July LTTE gunmen shot dead an unarmed civilian Velayutham Raveendran 
  at a bus stop in Akkaraipattu. Raveendran was the head of the EPDP-controlled 
  local council, whose predecessor too had suffered the same fate. His death came 
  at the height of the LTTE&#146;s campaign to brand all political opponents, 
  especially the EPDP, as &#147;paramilitary&#148; elements. The EPDP was no doubt 
  a prime target because it had managed to secure a place in Parliament in spite 
  of LTTE-terror. It was a clever ploy. If the LTTE could sow seeds of doubt among 
  its potential critics in the international community, suggesting by its use 
  of the term &#147;paramilitary&#148; that the EPDP was engaged in armed activity, 
  sympathy for its murdered party members would evaporate, as would diplomatic 
  engagement with the LTTE&#146;s rivals. </p>
<p>Now the LTTE&#146;s use of the &#147;paramilitary&#148; label has been disingenuously 
  extended to all Tamils everywhere who challenge its politics. This is no more 
  than the LTTE&#146;s latest effort to distract attention from its murderous 
  campaigns. The LTTE wants to be sole representative and it will continue to 
  kill &#147;traitors&#148; to achieve that goal. But it is a diversionary tactic 
  that hits a nerve, because almost every Sri Lankan Tamil capable of serious 
  political discussion today was politicised during 1970-1986 when Tamil youth 
  agitation gathered momentum. Many youth joined armed movements. Those with a 
  people-centred political vision, even if they joined the LTTE, left it in disgust. 
  Persons with such backgrounds form the core of the dissident movement today. 
</p>
<p>A group, including such persons, runs the London-based Tamil Broadcasting Corporation 
  (TBC), whose broadcasts were relayed to local audiences by the government owned 
  SLBC. By pummelling the TBC with the label &#145;paramilitary,&#146; the LTTE 
  stopped the Government from relaying its broadcasts. To seal the lips of all 
  those whom the LTTE calls &#145;paramilitaries&#146; would be to condemn the 
  Tamils to a political Stone Age sans hope.</p>
<p>Few options are available to any one living under the terror of LTTE to fight 
  for human values and rights. How will human rights advocates deal with the issues 
  arising? Will they look to the individual victims&#146; histories and affiliations, 
  or will they acknowledge the over-all picture of the LTTE&#146;s terror and 
  control, and its implication for the community within and without Sri Lanka?</p>
<p>We list some of the achievements of LTTE disinformation backed by terror:</p>
<ol start=1 type=1>
  <li>It has sent out a virtual ultimatum that it would not be possible to carry 
    forward the &#145;peace process&#146; without crushing all dissent.</li>
</ol>
<ol start=2 type=1>
  <li>Through its control of nearly all outlets for opinion, it has to a significant 
    extent turned the issue of its murder of political dissidents into gossip 
    about individuals.</li>
</ol>
<ol start=3 type=1>
  <li>It has sown enough confusion about events, issues and individuals to make 
    even seasoned advocates of human rights question their judgment.</li>
</ol>
<p>The European Union (EU) did issue a strong statement in August condemning the 
  LTTE&#146;s killings. But this came after several months of the EU, mistakenly, 
  abetting the LTTE&#146;s terror (see Bulletin No.36). An EU delegation called 
  on the LTTE last February to talk about North-East development in the wake of 
  a spate of LTTE killings in the North, including of a family of three with their 
  8 months-old infant. Up to and including the conclusion of the April parliamentary 
  elections, Norway and the EU covered up for the LTTE&#146;s abuses on behalf 
  of its puppet, the TNA, and facilitated the wholesale theft of votes. The Election 
  Commissioner&#146;s refusal to entertain complaints by election monitors is 
  almost certainly a reflection of donor pressure. The EU report deemed the North-East 
  results unrepresentative only after conscientious international monitors exposed 
  the blatant abuse.</p>
<p>Thus the Tamils have their TNA representatives in parliament, not even pretending 
  that they are the people&#146;s choice. They come trailing as their staff entourages 
  of killers and spies, adding to that menace which haunts dissidents in Colombo 
  like the plague. Regrets from the West came after enormous damage was done and 
  after the LTTE had been given ample opportunity target meticulously several 
  key democratic opponents.</p>
<p>The new thinking from the West and the direction of its funding agencies became 
  evident in the wake of the 1999 presidential elections. The National Alliance 
  for Peace in its leading questions to the candidates clearly pushed for appeasement 
  of the LTTE. Not remarkably, the UNP candidate Ranil Wickremasinghe adopted 
  the same line, ridiculing the search for a political solution. Given the array 
  of external lobbies and their local &#145;partners&#146; supporting Wickremasinghe, 
  President Kumaratunge&#146;s attempt to frame a political solution in 2000 was 
  doomed, and Wickremasinghe was rewarded with power in December 2001. Unfortunately 
  for him and his cohorts, the LTTE knew him, but not he the LTTE.</p>
<p>Convincing Western agencies to be mindful of the human and democratic rights 
  of people in the North-East at this time was like penetrating a stone wall. 
  After the signing of the MoU in February 2002, which committed the LTTE to respect 
  international law, the LTTE carefully began testing the ground. From February 
  to April 2002, we reported one abduction by the LTTE in the East and about four 
  abductees who escaped, all from the EPRLF(V). About half a dozen mysterious 
  murders were reported in Jaffna soon after the LTTE set up office in April, 
  which then stopped. </p>
<p>Organised attacks on Muslims in the East commenced in June 2002. In September 
  2002 two persons without any political connections were abducted in Jaffna and 
  allowed to escape. The same month the LTTE attacked the Hartley College Principal 
  and also members of the Socialist Equality Party in Jaffna. All the while child 
  conscription running into the thousands was going on unimpeded. By this time 
  the LTTE had got a clear message that its abuses would not be challenged, whether 
  by the international community, the SLMM or the Government of Sri Lanka. From 
  early December 2002, soon after the LTTE in Oslo committed itself to democratic 
  federalism, it set about eliminating dissidents steadily. By mid-December 2002 
  the LTTE had abducted 3 senior members of the EPDP in Batticaloa, now presumed 
  dead, and chopped to death Alahathurai, a respected member of the EPRLF(V) in 
  Mandur. </p>
<p>On 23<sup>rd</sup> April 2003, the LTTE murdered Maclan Atputharajah of Chavakacheri, 
  Jaffna, a leading local figure and prospective parliamentary candidate for the 
  EPRLF(V). It fell to Subathiran to visit the family in his own home area to 
  console them, and to challenge the regional press for not publishing the statement 
  by the family as agreed. Less than eight weeks hence, he too had fallen. Since 
  February 2002 (mainly from December 2002) about 140 EPDP members have been killed, 
  among the latest being C. Arulthas, former chairman of the Pt. Pedro local council, 
  and Bawan, parliamentary candidate for Jaffna.<a href="#top">[Top]</a></p>
<h3><a name="_Toc83561134"></a><a name="_Toc83561181">Rajani&#146;s Choice</a></h3>
<p>Rajani was deeply partisan, the consequences of which made many uncomfortable. 
  She, by choice, emotionally and politically identified with the suffering and 
  aspirations of the ordinary folk, who in the context of conflict came lowest 
  in the hierarchy of interests ruling their lives. Every middle class gravitates 
  towards a stable niche in the global hierarchy where their symbols and dull 
  aspirations are guaranteed. It is easy to become insensitive to the institutional 
  oppression which maintains that order. Those brought up in the Tamil middle 
  class in the 1940s and 50s with its cosy atmosphere of uncles, aunts and family 
  friends, would not have doubted its essential goodness. Its capacity for evil 
  became evident when a combination of discrimination and communal violence threatened 
  its stability and cohesion.</p>
<p>The vacillating dalliance of this middle class with the LTTE has tended towards 
  support when it appeared to hold out prospects for that old stability, notwithstanding 
  child-conscription and murder. The victims of the latter were as a rule from 
  the lowest strata of non-people. This middle class&#146; disgust with the LTTE 
  too comes periodically, such as during the 1995 exodus, when it shows itself 
  intrinsically incapable of any kind of order.</p>
<p>Further up the hierarchy, the West (and also the Colombo elite glued to it) 
  has shown a similar pattern in its perceptions of the LTTE. The LTTE would like 
  to sell itself off as a group that would accept its assigned place in a Western 
  dominated world order. But then its ideological pretensions requiring violent 
  excesses and its entrenchment in global terror networks make the West nervous.</p>
<p>Those with Rajani&#146;s Marxist worldview rose above such vacillations. For 
  the lowest in society and especially women, whether it was the inbuilt violence 
  of their society, the brutality of state forces, the LTTE killing family men 
  and women, and youth, as traitors; conscripting their children; or the unbridled 
  forces of capitalism that peace may bring; options may change, but violence 
  and oppression would remain. </p>
<p>Rajani did not waste time discussing or speculating about Vellupillai Prabhakaran 
  at length. One could explore Prabhakran&#146;s childhood experiences that left 
  in him an enormous craving for absolute power over others, but politically he 
  is a creature of circumstance; of the clash between the Sinhalese and Tamil 
  elite, and the humiliation experienced by the latter. Rajani saw Prabhakaran&#146;s 
  violence as ultimately receiving sanction and glorification from the ideology 
  of the Tamil elite.</p>
<p>Rajani&#146;s political journey was one involving enormous trauma. In the atmosphere 
  in Jaffna in the early 1980s, it was natural for idealistic youth to become 
  attracted to the militant groups. Her personal connections led her to the LTTE. 
  Her husband Dayapala Thirangama, an early political influence, and Southern 
  leftist of immense courage well above the narrowness of his times, had grave 
  reservations. Through their exchanges, Rajani also came to question the assumptions 
  of Tamil nationalism and became conscious of other struggles, especially those 
  in the South. </p>
<p>In January 1982, an LTTE assassin carrying out Prabhakaran&#146;s order, &#145;Put 
  off the Main Switch&#146;, killed his unsuspecting leading rival Sundaram of 
  PLOTE. Dayapala warned that unless this trend was checked, the LTTE would plunge 
  the Tamil community into utter disaster. It took Rajani, who was moved by the 
  urgency of the Tamil struggle in the aftermath of 1977, a few more years, while 
  she was on a doctoral programme in Britain, to see LTTE for what it was.</p>
<p>Rajani could have chosen escape through a career in the West. She could also 
  have found fame talking about liberation from a theoretical standpoint. Disregarding 
  warnings from friends, she returned to the University of Jaffna at the end of 
  1986. She believed this was the only honest option for her. Her objective was 
  not instant solution or instant liberation, but to work with those of all classes 
  with a social conscience to &#145;create space&#146;. </p>
<p>Conflict transformation as advocated by peacemakers assumes residual rationality 
  on both sides to assess what is attainable and sustainable, and some real opportunity 
  for people&#146;s initiatives. Unless there is any space within society itself 
  for such initiatives, any agreement is bound to be fragile.</p>
<p>Any illusions about the LTTE, for Rajani and others close to her, were dissipated 
  by events from May 1986 to November 1987. During this period it first launched 
  bloody massacres of other Tamil groups. Despite being militarily weak, it refused 
  to engage with a political settlement President Jayewardene was made to offer 
  by India. The Government declared a unilateral ceasefire in April 1987, which 
  the LTTE rejected through once more massacring Buddhist pilgrims and exploding 
  a car bomb in Colombo&#146;s main bus stand, provoking heavy government reprisals 
  in Jaffna. When India intervened to save the LTTE from ignominy and to offer 
  it preponderant control over the North-East, it contrived war with India by 
  massacring hundreds of Sinhalese civilians. At war with India, the LTTE played 
  to clockwork perfection, deliberately ensuring maximum destruction and maximum 
  civilian deaths at every stage. As the Indian Army started restoring order, 
  it sent its hit teams to kill as traitors even civilian representatives trying 
  to secure basic amenities. Rajani wrote in the <i>Broken Palmyra</i> (Ch.6, 
  uthr.org): </p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>&#147;When the children were dying with diseases, they threatened 
  those who cared for them, ordering them not to issue Indian drugs. Did they 
  offer alternatives, so that we could eat Tiger food and give our children Tiger 
  drugs?&#148;</p>
<p>Rajanis&#146; judgment of the LTTE and its prospects were penned in the following 
  words written for the <i>Broken Palmyra</i> in early 1988:</p>
<p><i>&#147;The Tigers' history, their theoretical vacuum, lack of political creativity, 
  intolerance and fanatical dedication will be the ultimate cause of their own 
  break up. The legendary Tigers will go to their demise with their legends smeared 
  with the blood and tears of victims of their own misdoings. A new Tiger will 
  not emerge from their ashes. Only by breaking with this whole history and its 
  dominant ideology, can a new liberating outlook be born.&#148;</i></p>
<p>The last sentence describes succinctly what she viewed as the painful way out, 
  and formed the basis of her intense work in the UTHR(J), the University and 
  in the wider community, especially among traumatised women. What she wrote about 
  the LTTE was not a wish or a hope, it was the incontrovertible knowledge of 
  an insider.</p>
<p>Rajani was very careful in what she wrote for the book, as she was with what 
  her co-authors wrote. She was concerned about the tone of the book and was averse 
  to middle-class complacencies to which some of us were prone. Finally it was 
  decided that the different authors would have a certain leeway, while all would 
  take joint responsibility for the book as a whole. </p>
<p>In her work with the UTHR(J) and in discussions with her students, Rajani tried 
  to shift the question of violent of death away from a propaganda recital of 
  frequently exaggerated numbers killed by state forces to an examination of individual 
  tragedies of all victims, whether ideologically convenient or not. What kind 
  of liberation can a force offer, which dignifies only its dead as martyrs to 
  glorify the Leader, while insulting all others who died as ciphers; which drives 
  individuals and sections of society into working against it for sheer survival, 
  and then kills them off as traitors? Just before the passage quoted above, she 
  said of the massive death imposed on civilians in October 1987:</p>
<p><i>&#147;&#133;regardless of any future consequence, they pushed India to the 
  wall when they started butchering the Sinhalese civilians in a fit of petulant 
  anger. Therefore, in reality it was not only India's failure as a guarantor, 
  but also the L.T.T.E.'s failure as a leader that triggered off the war in this 
  way.&#148;</i></p>
<p>The LTTE killed her upon the announcement of the Indian Army&#146;s withdrawal, 
  after President Premadasa in the course of secret talks with the LTTE had promised 
  it virtual unchecked control of the North-East. It was a precursor to the present 
  &#145;peace process&#146;. It was about this time that we began hearing hints 
  from Western peace activists, who were otherwise sympathetic, that we were partisan 
  or extreme. They were happy with an arrangement that saw India leave, and for 
  the LTTE and the Premadasa government to assume their places under Western patronage. 
</p>
<p>What followed was a nightmare reminiscent of the situation today. Many with 
  dissident associations thought the LTTE had got what it wanted and had no further 
  need to kill, and so remained in North-East. They were carried off to concentration 
  camps and killed by the thousands, as the LTTE returned to war with the Government 
  in June 1990. The war was triggered off in a provocative series of massacres 
  by the LTTE calculated to bring about severe reprisals against Tamils.<a href="#top">[Top]</a></p>
<h3><a name="_Toc83561135"></a><a name="_Toc83561182">Condemned to Absolute Predictability</a></h3>
<p>Prabhakaran must be pondering another dreaded anniversary, his 50<sup>th</sup> 
  birthday, which falls in November, and what he has achieved. When he began his 
  career 32 years ago, the Tamil nationalist dream was for a homeland, prosperous 
  and self-contained, where its excellent educational system would tower to new 
  heights. Today this homeland is the place Tamils least want to be in. Much of 
  its arable lands are strewn with landmines or are taken up by High Security 
  Zones of both the government forces and the LTTE. Colombo and a number of cities 
  in the West have overtaken Jaffna, Trincomalee and Batticaloa as centres of 
  Tamil culture.</p>
<p>The North-East which once had a surfeit of doctors and technical personnel 
  is now in need of Sinhalese professionals to run its services. Often for specialist 
  services, those in the North-East must go to Colombo to see Sinhalese, or the 
  few remaining Tamil, specialists. Even LTTE sympathisers with feeling for the 
  people readily admit that should there be another round of war, no one will 
  be left to rebuild the North-East.</p>
<p>Prabhakaran&#146;s hubris has resulted in the inevitable breakup of the LTTE. 
  Should the LTTE persist in its present course, it stands to lose the entire 
  East. What good has 33 months of peace and the lifting of restrictions done 
  to the long suffering people who have borne the brunt of LTTE extortion, child-conscription 
  and wholesale theft of representation? The Northern farmer, managing with minimum 
  government support, was traditionally self-sufficient. We recently had reports 
  (perhaps suppressed earlier) of a significant incidence of suicide among Vanni 
  farmers unable to make ends meet. The failure of reconstruction in the last 
  33 months cannot be blamed entirely on the Government. It has much to do with 
  the LTTE&#146;s total obsession with military preparations and military advantage 
  as its clash with Gurunagar fishermen on 30<sup>th</sup> August revealed, and 
  organisations involved in development well know.</p>
<p>While development professionals strike a balance between need and feasibility, 
  the TRO (the LTTE&#146;s development arm) has other priorities. There have been 
  instances where a development agency started reconstruction work in a village 
  only to have it burnt down by TRO officials. Agencies drawing up reconstruction 
  priorities, have, to their disbelief, been taken by TRO officials past several 
  uninhabited villages to a remote one having no neighbours, public transport 
  or market. The reason &#150; it is near an army camp!</p>
<p>The inherent destructiveness of the LTTE on the basis of which Rajani made 
  her prediction about its future, has, since her murder, been carried to draconian 
  limits. Her murder was itself a signal of that intention.</p>
<p>Child recruitment, which was a burning issue in the last three years of Rajini&#146;s 
  life, is today one of child conscription and abduction on a grand scale.</p>
<p>Rajani observed that the LTTE&#146;s suicide cult was the symptom of a political 
  vacuum mistakenly dubbed &#145;ultimate sacrifice&#146;, when its cadres, as 
  instructed, swallow cyanide rather than face the responsibility of keeping faith 
  under capture. She added:</p>
<p><i>&#147;Given some imagined aspirations and needs, this state of the psyche, 
  through a process of rationalisation, led increasingly to annihilatory ends.&#148;</i></p>
<p>The &#145;increasingly annililatory&#146; ends she anticipated, came with full-blown 
  Black Tiger units in the early 1990s, sworn to obiliterate themselves on a personal 
  oath to the Leader, as to a god, at his bidding. The Leader cheapened these 
  victims to the price of a bullet when he dispatched one to kill Neelan Thiruchelvam, 
  a harmless democrat. More Orwellian are the Leader&#146;s Red Blossomed Garden 
  childrens&#146; homes. We know of cases of children forcibly taken from war 
  affected distraught parents. These children are raised in daily religious veneration 
  of the Leader and streamed according to their abilities to fit various slots 
  in the organisation.</p>
<p>The last speaks most eloquently of the LTTE&#146;s prospects of stabilising 
  itself in a federal unit or even in a separate state that allows some token 
  dissent. It is cruel arrogance to ignore this reality and sacrifice people to 
  the shallow wishful thinking of peacemakers. Prediction is tricky business, 
  but there is nothing marvellous about Rajani having been so depressingly right 
  about the LTTE.</p>
<p><b>Creating Space for the People</b></p>
<p>Where a people has even marginal democratic choice to change its rulers or 
  even the way they act, prediction, especially long term, is hazardous. But when 
  the leader is utterly intolerant of allowing the people any choice, presides 
  over material and social catastrophe, and a disappearing and increasingly suffocated 
  population, his prospects are trivially predictable. </p>
<p>The LTTE&#146;s every move has been to tighten the screws of repression. It 
  imposes itself as an insatiable parasite on the shrinking resources of the people 
  unable to bear it; and compensates for declining real strength by abducting 
  children and unleashing brain washed youth as human bombs. For such a force 
  there is nothing, no end point, between total success and utter failure. The 
  LTTE would either break itself, be broken, or would perform its office of destruction 
  to the last suicide bomber in its armoury. That is what Rajini said, and its 
  attitude towards the current peace process confirms it. Many ordinary villagers 
  with their instinctive grasp of reality have said this said all along. It is 
  the others who must be creative in dealing with the LTTE, and the Sinhalese 
  polity and Sri Lankan governments have been singularly destructive.</p>
<p>Rajani&#146;s work on the ground was to create space for the people. This was 
  undermined, and her death, and that of many others, was precipitated by President 
  Premadasa&#146;s cynical appeasement of the LTTE to the point of aiding it to 
  round up its opponents.</p>
<p>It is not war that we have advocated and we do not see war as the way out of 
  the present impasse. War was always imposed on the people who never wanted it. 
  What we have advocated as a decisive means of opening up space is a political 
  settlement. It is this that would once and for all remove the main weapon in 
  the LTTE&#146;s arsenal: the belief that the Sinhalese would never give the 
  Tamils a just solution and would never treat them as equals. The LTTE has continued 
  to propagate this negative picture of the Sinhalese, while on the one hand declining 
  to engage on a political settlement, and on the other constantly driving a wedge 
  between the main parties in the South.</p>
<p>One cannot blame the West entirely for the current MoU and its LTTE bias, considering 
  that the Sinhalese polity, even in the 11 years after 1990, seemed more prepared 
  to break up the country than to offer a political settlement. Of course President 
  Kumaratunge tried to deliver one. Ranil Wickremasinghe was determined to block 
  it as he thought it fatal to his ambitions. Upon finding a constitutional settlement 
  blocked, President Kumaratunge could have taken recourse to the 13<sup>th</sup> 
  Amendment and the North-East Provincial Council as an interim measure, to demonstrate 
  her commitment to devolution. But she did not.</p>
<p>Despite the transient relief of no-war, most Tamils were never impressed with 
  appeasement, whether Premadasa&#146;s or Wickremasinghe&#146;s. Both these were 
  accompanied by the sinister rumble of low-key violence whose implications were 
  hard to ignore. There may be a strong temptation today for the Sinhalese polity 
  to do nothing, as long as it is a process of Tamils destroying Tamils. No one 
  has destroyed Tamil nationalist aspirations to nationhood more thoroughly than 
  Prabhakaran and his outfit. Rajani wrote:</p>
<p><i>&#147;&#133;the Tamil nationalist struggle under the L.T.T.E. leadership 
  had gone on a path of internal destruction and terror, alienating and cleaving 
  the community. It was failing in its objective by not conceptualising the needs 
  of a struggle whose primary objective was creating a self-sufficient, autonomous 
  state (as far as possible) out of an inextricably linked Sri Lanka.&#148;</i></p>
<p>Encouraging Prabhakaran may be seen as the ultimate success of Sinhalese chauvinist 
  aspirations. But that would be like stabbing the heart to spite a finger. What 
  after all is Sri Lanka today? There can be no democracy, dignity or protection 
  of the law for the Sinhalese while denying these to the Tamils. Cynicism on 
  such matters creates habits of mind and heart pregnant with devastating consequences. 
  That was the most powerful lesson of President Jeyawardene&#146;s career. Every 
  time one sees a eulogy for him as a great statesman, one is reminded that the 
  nation is divided and sick.</p>
<p>There should be no further sacrifice of Tamils who came forward to challenge 
  fascism. We showed that the LTTE became bold about killing only after testing 
  the ground through much of 2002 and finding that the international community 
  would pay little attention. That must now be reversed decisively. <a href="#top">[Top]</a></p>
