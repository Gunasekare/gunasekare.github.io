<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The killing on 12<sup>th</sup> August of
Lakshman Kadirgamar, Sri Lanka’s Foreign Minister and the government’s most
senior Tamil officeholder has brought to the world’s attention one of many
heinous acts carried out by the LTTE over the years. Will the international
community once again make rhetorical statements of condemnation and yet close
its eyes to the other daily acts of violence that have for so long engulfed our
community?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Lakshman Kadirgamar was a respected figure
in the Southern polity, one of the few who understood and opposed the fascist
nature of the LTTE and voiced his criticism worldwide. There can be no
illusions about who killed him, or why. But Southern politics has long been
dominated by illusions, unattainable shortcuts and untrammelled opportunism.
Upcoming elections and the associated deal making currently in the air, work to
Sri Lanka’s detriment and to the LTTE’s gain.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>A perverted culture also prevails among a
section of the expatriate Tamil community that celebrates this type of killing.
The attitudes expressed in the many websites which promote hatred and narrow
ideology in the name nationalism need to be checked if the Tamil community is
going to regain its humanity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>And while
the LTTE-dominated Tamil media gloats over Kadirgamar’s murder, the climate of
impunity in Sri Lanka and the Police atrophied by the non-investigation of
hundreds of killings of Tamils will leave room for mischief and manipulation.
There can be no civilisation, democracy, peace or dignity of citizens without
competent law enforcement.</span></p>

<h1><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>Norway’s
Role<o:p></o:p></span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Since the beginning UTHR(J) has expressed
concern over major flaws in the peace process that reward impunity, encourage
the LTTE to violate the Cease-fire Agreement (CFA) and provide no meaningful
checks on abuse.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>We have also consistently raised questions
about Norway’s positioning, which has often been both politically charged and
extremely soft on human rights.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Norway
began the peace process in 2002 by quite openly sidelining President
Kumaratunge in favour of her long-time political adversary, Prime Minister
Ranil Wickremasinghe. It showed its readiness to further interfere politically
when it threatened to withdraw from the peace process over the President’s
takeover of ministries dealing with security in November 2003. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>At the same time, Norway has virtually ignored
the LTTE’s political killings and its scandalous conscription of children. The
Norwegian government even facilitated LTTE efforts to strengthen its worldwide
propaganda network (and thus its control over Tamil populations) by for
example, helping them to acquire transmitting equipment.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Norway has facilitated travel abroad for
so-called LTTE fact-finding missions, including coaxing European
representatives to meet them. Norwegian lobbying of the international community
has encouraged tacit support for the LTTE’s methods, and diluted or obstructed
many initiatives aimed at holding it to account. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>It is time for Norway to reassess its role
in the process and have the courage to admit that they made wrong assessments
of the ground realities and to openly declare that it is not only the CFA that
needs reappraisal, but also that the SLMM is not an adequate mechanism for the
task at hand.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<h2><span lang=EN-GB>Fantasies and Bankruptcy</span></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Several NGOs in the South have sought
comfort in “politically correctness,” projecting themselves as peacemakers by
embracing conflict resolution strategies endorsed by Norway that have little
applicability to the Sri Lankan reality. The daily killings and promotion by
default of terror politics in the Tamil community have been treated as minor
irritations to an otherwise excellent peace process. The LTTE’s suicidal
ideology and its effect on the Tamil community has been almost completely
ignored, while any token commitment by the LTTE to democracy has been welcomed
as a statement of good faith in a bid to perpetuate the status quo. In this
perverted social analysis, fascistic actions are treated as mere illiberal
tendencies. Contrarily, when Southern groups voiced anti-NGO rhetoric, they
were called fascists without any reservation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>This attitude of the peacemakers and
erstwhile progressives has out of bankruptcy identified Tamil rights with
appeasement of the LTTE. It reflects a continuing disregard for the risks taken
by members of the Tamil community struggling against the LTTE’s ruthless bid for
asserting total control while demanding a political solution ensuring dignity
and fair play. More ironically, the peacemakers have conceded the moral high
ground of defending the basic human rights of Tamils and their children to
Sinhalese supremacist elements, who long stood against a decent political
settlement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The UNP played a particularly callous game
in this regard, flirting with Sinhalese chauvinism to obstruct a political
settlement, while at the same time promising the LTTE a fiefdom to attain power.
Combined with the utter passivity of the present government, it allowed the
LTTE to entrench its killer squads all over the country and to play Russian
roulette with the peace process. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The ‘Sri Lanka experts’ in global capitals,
whose attitudes reflect the growing contempt for democracy in their own
countries, came to respect principally the LTTE’s stunning capacity for
violence, which it held together by constantly attacking the humanity of its
people. Its mafia-like network, which it wove to continually upgrade its
destructive power under the very noses of Western governments, is allowed to go
unchecked. Indeed, it was virtually rewarded with sole representation of the
Tamil community. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The ISGA or P-toms, both a formal
expression of appeasement, looked appropriate against the South being unable to
present a cohesive political challenge to the LTTE.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Demands for human rights protection and democratic space for
alternative voices were treated as efforts to inhibit the peace process. It was
in fact, this lack of clarity and direction in all sections of the Sinhalese
polity and the failure to perceive the consequences that pushed Norway into its
disproportionately influential role.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Elite Southern NGOs and members of the
international community appear to be waiting for the UNP to come to power once
again, to promote the ISGA as the means to achieve peace, a strategy that
promises rewards for everyone but the ordinary Tamil people; their predicament
is apparently of no concern.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Even in this climate, individuals and small
networks of committed individuals in Sri Lanka and abroad, joined isolated
organisations such as UTHR(J) in exposing the continued child conscription and
political killings, and lobbied for tangible initiatives to address them. The conscription
of children was so rampant and open that even UNICEF, which supported
engagement with LTTE to resolve it, was finally forced to come out openly and
critically against the LTTE’s behaviour. However, the present initiatives in
the Security Council to check child recruitment may not have any real impact on
the LTTE if the leading nations, especially Norway, determine that they should
be ineffective so that their discredited peace strategy would have a further
lease of life.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></span></p>

<h1><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>The
Cost of Self-serving Illusions<o:p></o:p></span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Lakshman Kadirgamar’s murder was one of
many and bears a resemblance to those that preceded it.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Just hours before his assassination, SLBC
journalist Relangi Selvarajah and her husband were shot and killed in their travel
agency office in the Bambalapitya neighbourhood of Colombo. Relangi Selvarajah
had produced a radio programme that was critical of the LTTE. They leave behind
an eighteen-month-old infant born after many years of childlessness.<span

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Subathiran of the EPRLF, who was important
to the revival of democracy among Tamils as Kadirgamar was to Sri Lanka, was
killed on 14<sup>th</sup> June 2003. The SLMM guardians played the role of the
proverbial three respectively blind, deaf and dumb monkeys, who dismiss
political killings as mere criminal acts unconnected with the peace process. It
is further ironical that ignoring the LTTE’s use of a sniper from a nearby tall
building to assassinate Subathiran, who was exercising, may have served to
encourage its use as the modus operandi against Kadirgamar in similar
circumstances.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The Police’s failure to investigate
Subathiran’s killing despite the evidence against Easwaran (then Nallur LTTE
Commissar) being available immediately, also created the climate for the same
Easwaran to play a leading role in abducting and killing Jaffna SP Charles
Wijewardene following the accidental shooting by an SL Army soldier in Inuvil
on 5<sup>th</sup> August 2005. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>In the face of mounting internal dissension
and resistance from the people, the LTTE’s typical moves are to provoke reprisals
and a return to war. This time the absence of reprisals against civilians,
which the LTTE hoped for, threw the focus on the LTTE’s miscreants and placed
it in a crisis. Its provocations became more desperate. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Along with the lethargy in seeking a political
settlement, the illusion persists that the LTTE respects Sinhalese who act with
friendliness and goodwill, provided they ignore the LTTE’s treatment of its
fellow Tamils. On the contrary it has contempt for them and when it wants to
provoke, they are the first targets. When the LTTE wanted to provoke war with
the Indian Army in October 1987, the first victims were Chairman Jayamanne of
the Cement Corporation and several journalists who had come from the South in a
spirit of goodwill. Soosai then cruelly killed two very friendly and helpful
Sinhalese policemen in Valvettithurai. When the LTTE wanted a return to war in
1990, it killed hundreds of security personnel who were hobnobbing with it
during the appeasement that preceded it. In a land of illusions and shortcuts
leaders do not want to understand.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Dealing with the LTTE to prevent a
recurrence of war is important. But there can never be a surrender of human
rights and basic functions and responsibilities that give dignity to a State.
Equally there should be no illusions about the nature of the LTTE, for which
there is absolutely no excuse. The LTTE’s recent behaviour has been
precipitated by the Karuna split in 2004 and the failure of Norway’s stratagems
on Prabhakaran’s behalf. (Norway pronounced that it was an internal affair, but

who held power in the North-East. It was such an alleged lack of clarity about

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Kadirgamar joins an unending line of
Tamils, all distinguished in their chosen spheres and victims of LTTE killer
squads, who defied the advance of fascism and worked for a dawn when there
would be peace with dignity for all. Among them were Subathiran, Cheliyan
Perinpanayagam, Neelan Thiruchelvam, Thangathurai and many others known and not
so well known. In the absence of the Sinhalese polity and leadership
challenging the LTTE by coming forward with a political settlement that
addresses Tamil aspirations, all such Tamils were facing marginalisation, of
which they were painfully aware, and life itself would have become more painful
than death.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The Sinhalese polity has a choice. It could
shower empty words of praise on these Tamils and go on as before, or get its
act together and seek dignity and justice for all. If it chooses the former,
appeasement with its illusions is the only course open. If the latter, it is
time to examine Norway’s role and show that we are capable of deciding our own
future. Then the demands below will be appropriate:</span></p>
