<p align=center style='text-align:center'><b><span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:12.0pt;'>Foreword</span></b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-AU
style='font-size:12.0pt;'>The present volume was intended to mark the golden jubilee 
  of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which fell on 10th December 1998, 
  and the 10th anniversary of the assassination of one our founding members, <a href="../Rajani.htm">Dr. 
  Rajani Thiranagama</a>. Both the jubilee year and the anniversary year went 
  by. In exploring material to write a book of this nature, the work tends to 
  increase with time, and there is always another document to be read or someone 
  else that one would like to interview, until one feels that there is a fairly 
  complete book.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-AU
style='font-size:12.0pt;'>When some of us from the University of Jaffna, who later 
  came to be involved in the UTHR(J), were involved in writing <i>The Broken Palmyra, 
  </i>it<i> </i>was a collective effort. We were constantly meeting each other 
  and discussing issues. In our present circumstances, it fell to me to author 
  this book, and I trust it reflects the wider heritage of the UTHR(J). Where 
  I had doubts I consulted my colleague Dr. Sritharan and where I have discussed 
  Tamil fascism, I have drawn generously from the analyses of Sri (Sritharan) 
  and Rajini (Rajani Thiranagama).</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><i><span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:12.0pt;'>The 
  Broken Palmyra</span></i><span lang=EN-AU
style='font-size:12.0pt;'> was written in the context of the inner compulsions 
  of a fascist polity, which turned the opportunity provided by the Indo-Lanka 
  accord into an orgy of death. Where we discussed the State and the Southern 
  polity, it was mainly as background to the principal story. The approach of 
  the present book may be treated as an inversion of that which guided <i>The 
  Broken Palmyra</i>. The two books reflect different preoccupations at different 
  points of time. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'>We, then, in 1987, felt a need to account for the 
  civilian dead. They were the victims of calculated provocation by the LTTE as 
  well as the arrogance and incompetence behind India's peace-keeping role. We 
  viewed the Indo-Lanka Accord as an opportunity for the people to reassert some 
  control over their destiny. This control would not come through dependence on 
  the Indian or the Sri Lankan states. However, the people were paralysed, trapped 
  in the LTTE's totalitarianism. Given their inability to question the LTTE in 
  the first instance, any protest against the harshness of the Indian or the Sri 
  Lankan states was not going restore their dignity. We hoped that pushing the 
  Sri Lankan Government to implement the Accord would clear the air for some good 
  to emerge. We foresaw that in the event of the people failing to deal with the 
  LTTE, they would be driven to depending on the Indian or Sri Lankan states, 
  or both, to do it for them. This remains largely the picture today.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-AU
style='font-size:12.0pt;'>Likewise, an opportunity arose in 1994 when President 
  Kumaratunge was elected on the pledge of ushering in peace with dignity. This 
  was wasted by the LTTE's calculated malignancy, the UNP's opportunism and the 
  chauvinist inertia of the Sinhalese polity. The LTTE's credibility and acceptability 
  are today in question among international observers. The exacerbation of this 
  problem over many decades has, however, imbued them with a cynical view of the 
  Sri Lankan State. Consequently, LTTE lobbies have been able to manipulate susceptible 
  liberal and radical minds. The LTTE has thus acquired a survival capacity underpinned 
  by the Tamil community's continuing devastation. Further aggravating this tragedy 
  is the Southern polity's rejection even of Mrs. Kumaratunge's diluted constitutional 
  proposals of August 2000.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-AU
style='font-size:12.0pt;'>Today's trench warfare involving very lethal weapons 
  is very costly to the combatants. With shifting frontiers, it has also become 
  scorched-earth warfare. When both sides are desperate, no quarter is given even 
  to traditional places of civilian refuge (our Bulletin No.24 of 7.9.00). In 
  the meantime, in areas under LTTE control such as the Vanni, the villages are 
  being wiped clean of Tamil youth, who, under a system of compulsory military 
  service, are being placed on the front-lines to be roasted by fire from Multi-Barrel 
  Rocket Launchers.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-AU
style='font-size:12.0pt;'>Can the State evade responsibility for Tamil child soldiers 
  by dismissing them as victims of fascism? The eagerness to get propaganda mileage 
  out of the LTTE's use of children has not been matched by benignant political 
  measures. These would have blunted its ability to play on the alienation of 
  the young. Bungling the Tamil question for more than 40 years is, in the modern 
  era of interdependence, an unconscionably long time. Could a credible nation 
  have waited so long without any meaningful strategy and without the will to 
  implement ameliorative measures?</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-AU
style='font-size:12.0pt;'>This book will primarily therefore examine the State 
  and the Southern polity. The communal violence of July 1983 and the JVP insurgency 
  of 1987-89 will form two central events in the development. The post July 1983 
  State was one that was mentally under siege. The openness of the 1970s and early 
  '80s that allowed a new appreciation of Sri Lanka's plural legacy to emerge 
  gave way to suffocation. Out of this emerged a malignantly violent JVP. This 
  second tragedy resulted from the failure of the Southern polity to face up to 
  the real meaning of July 1983, and overlaying it instead with fiction.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-AU
style='font-size:12.0pt;'>The JVP insurgency left the South with innumerable blood-stained 
  hands. No political party and no sector of civil life in the South escaped its 
  effects. Again there has been an attempt to overlay it with fiction and score 
  points in the game of sticking the 'killer' label onto others. Less known is 
  the extent to which the event crippled the Southern polity, including the 'progressives' 
  and the non-governmental sector. This too will be a theme running through the 
  latter half of the book.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-AU
style='font-size:12.0pt;'>There is another important difference between the present 
  book and the <i>Broken Palmyra,</i> Today I and my companions of yore are relatively 
  old and sanguine about the future. We have no illusions about being able to 
  influence the course of things. With advancing age we are all limited by the 
  choices we already made and by the truths we tried to bury because they were 
  too hard to face. One is often resigned to the feeling that the clash of infernal 
  machines that had set their ideological course several decades ago, will find 
  its natural outcome, undeterred by counter-measures that are either too feeble 
  or even token. Change needs to be the task of a younger generation with hope 
  that is capable of learning from the mistakes of those gone before.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-AU
style='font-size:12.0pt;'>Where the advance of age carries us is well described 
  by these lines from Dante Gabriel Rossetti's <i>Barren Spring</i>:</span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent align="center"><i><span lang=EN-AU>.... So Spring comes 
  merry towards me here, but earns </span></i></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent align="center"><i><span lang=EN-AU>No answering smile 
  from me, whose life is twin'd </span></i></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent align="center"><i><span lang=EN-AU>With the dead boughs 
  that winter still must bind </span></i></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent align="center"><i><span
lang=EN-AU>And whom today the Spring no more concerns.</span></i></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-AU
style='font-size:12.0pt;'>By comparison, in the midst of death and destruction 
  in the wake of the Indian Army's advance on Jaffna, we had hope. It was Rajani's 
  inspiration that we must not let the Indian Army or the other powers that be, 
  sort out our future; we must act, not by pushing ourselves to assume heroic 
  mantles; but by creating an institutional framework, whereby the abilities of 
  different individuals will find their rightful place, and so help the community 
  to determine its own future. It was within this organisational framework that 
  any attack on the rights and dignity of the people could be resisted firmly.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-AU
style='font-size:12.0pt;'>It was a remarkable experiment in the University of 
  Jaffna. It involved patient and exhausting political work, talking to people 
  and persuading them to take on responsibility. Rajini and Sritharan were at 
  the forefront of this effort. Its strength was that no individual was unduly 
  exposed, because a large number of people from the Vice Chancellor to the students 
  and non-academic staff were part of it. The LTTE found this self-assertion on 
  the part of the University striking at the very heart of its totalitarian claims. 
  It set about identifying individuals to put an end to it and murdered Rajini 
  on 21st September 1989. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-AU
style='font-size:12.0pt;'>Time has moved on with the danger of Rajini's real contributions 
  and her grasp of reality, which she acquired through real life experience in 
  the struggle, being discarded in favour of token gestures. Year after year her 
  commemoration has drawn the same kind of people, progressive and leftwing. Yet 
  one has the uneasy feeling of having become isolated. The global culture is 
  upon us, with its emphasis on peace and stability. The peace on offer is a euphemism 
  for stability that is compatible with gross human rights violations.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-AU
style='font-size:12.0pt;'>It has suddenly become the vogue among activists to 
  call upon others, <i>&#147;To show some degree of respect towards the convictions 
  of the members of the LTTE&#148;.</i> The purposeful dehumanisation which drives 
  a woman to blow herself up, and others, is too readily sanitised as &#145;conviction&#146;. 
  One day recently, I found myself being pulled up by the scruff of my neck to 
  be reminded where Rajini would have stood on the matter. It came in the form 
  of an article by Nalin Swaris in the <i>Island </i>of 12<sup>th</sup> July 2000. 
  It was also a reminder of how she had influenced and was admired by people who 
  did not know her directly. What follows is an excerpt from that article: </span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText3><span lang=EN-AU>&#147;Speaking of the female agency, Rajani 
  Thiranagama Rajasingham shines like a bright star in a firmament darkened by 
  hate mongers, political opportunists, hair-splitting and sycophantic intellectuals. 
  After the Anuradhapura massacre she stated publicly, If this is what it takes 
  to achieve Tamil Liberation, it is not worth having at all. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><i><span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:12.0pt;'>&#147;She 
  was right when she wrote from Jaffna in November 1987:</span></i></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><i><span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:12.0pt;'>&#145;Today 
  we are trapped people. We are made to walk this suicidal trip. Our great defenders 
  and freedom fighters lure the enemy to our doorstep ignite a landmine, fire 
  from each and every refugee camp, and escape to safety. And then come the shells 
  whizzing. Bloody hell! The Tigers have withdrawn and we the sacrificial lambs, 
  drop dead in lots... Our society has no will to organise. It is totally crumbled. 
  There isn't a single civilian structure to connect up with. The era has demised 
  with so much loss and bitterness all around.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span lang=EN-AU

  want to prove&#146;, she wrote, &#145;that ordinary women like me also have 
  the courage to fight alone and hold our inner selves together.&#146;</span></i></p>
<p><i><span lang=EN-AU
style='font-size:12.0pt;'>&#147;Far better than shattering oneself to kill indiscriminately. 
  The only way to honour Rajani's memory is not to compromise the principles for 
  which she was killed, by the LTTE. </span></i></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText2><span lang=EN-AU>&#147;Terrorism, whether perpetrated by 
  the State or anti-State agencies is a Crime Against Humanity. We cannot be ambiguous 
  or ambivalent about this.&quot;</span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-AU>Rajani&#146;s political philosophy and action 
  were based on a love for ordinary people and resisting anything that is a CRIME 
  AGAINST HUMANITY. That is a challenge that today&#146;s activists and peace 
  lobby tend to forget too easily.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-AU
style='font-size:12.0pt;'>During the last 20 years many people, only a fraction 
  of them known to me, have died prematurely with a great deal more to give those 
  around them. Most of them were ordinary people, students and peasants. Few were 
  in any sense politically active. One of them was Mrs. Mallika Rasaratnam, whom 
  I came to know as a contributor to the <i>Saturday Review</i> during the mid-80s. 
  She was an architect by profession.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-AU
style='font-size:12.0pt;'>During a visit to Jaffna in 1997, I discovered that 
  she had re-designed St. Peter&#146;s Church that was destroyed by war and so 
  was pleasantly surprised to find that she had stayed on in Jaffna in spite of 
  all the difficulties. My wife and I paid her two visits and talked at length. 
  She was the mother of two girls. Her husband passed away in early 1998. She 
  was killed by the LTTE bomb which exploded on 11<sup>th</sup> September 1998 
  during a conference on regulating traffic in the City of Jaffna, in Mayor Sivapalan&#146;s 
  office. In her article<i> &#145;Prosaic&#146; North and East</i>, which well 
  expresses the connection between her land, the psychology of its people and 
  the need for change, she states:</span></p>
<p><i><span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:12.0pt;'>&#147;Self-immolation, as a method 
  of showing protest in private and public life is of recent origin. With a longstanding 
  &#145;anti-convenience&#146; tradition, a delight in needless suffering has 
  come to be a value of life, licked to shape, to suit a supposed spiritual development. 
  Unwarranted, out-of-place asceticism has made us imagine even commonplace things 
  as luxuries and also to feel, that, humble selves as we are, we have not the 
  right to wealth, power, social importance, high office and even to a habitable 
  environment.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:12.0pt;'>&#147;The new Values we need 
  to know may be Aesthetic or Spiritual, reflecting the principle that beauty 
  is an end in itself, and that man will find relaxation, renewed strength and 
  inspiration in the views of rivers, sea-shores, bays and tall trees.&#148;</span></i></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-AU>The article with her sympathetic and thoughtful 
  suggestions appears in full as Appendix IV. The Tamil people would become liberated 
  only when there is freedom for the creative use of the energies of their men 
  and women. The best have been pushed into a frustrating life of dissidence. 
  Its effects on a sensitive mind can be seen in the despairing poems of Miss. 
  Sivaramani Sivanandan who was finally driven to suicide. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-AU
style='font-size:12.0pt;'>Two other dissidents who were close to us were Manoharan 
  and Miss. Chelvy Thiyagarajah. They were in 1990 final year students at the 
  University of Jaffna. Their opposition to the LTTE was non-violent. They were 
  both executed in the LTTE's prison camps. Even under the horrors of imprisonment 
  by the LTTE, both Manoharan and Chelvy, from the last news we received of them, 
  remained true to their belief in the values of freedom. This tells us something 
  about why they, and many others like them, were executed in the LTTE's prison 
  camps in the early 1990s. Translations from the Tamil of two poems, one by Sivaramani 
  and the other by Chelvy are given respectively at the beginning and end of Chapter 
  22.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-AU
style='font-size:12.0pt;'>The ability to distinguish between individuals, institutions 
  and processes of which they were part, came to me rather late. It was part of 
  my education in an engagement with my Marxist colleagues in <i>The Broken Palmyra</i>. 
  Most of the Jaffna youth of my time grew up as instinctive nationalists and 
  supporters of the Federal Party. With it went a dangerous inherent assumption 
  of the superiority of the Tamils over the Sinhalese, and a certain uneasiness 
  about the Muslims who were also largely Tamil speaking.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-AU
style='font-size:12.0pt;'>Disillusionment started coming in the 1970s, but very 
  slowly. In the face of the blind obduracy of the State - the 'standardisation' 
  crisis of 1970, the new constitution of 1972, the communal violence of 1977 
  etc. - the growing fascist tendency within the Tamil community seemed no more 
  than a passing disease. It was dangerously easy to subscribe to the 'non-violence' 
  of the Federal Party and remain ambivalent about political killings by the 'Boys' 
  - the incipient militant movement. Again, for those of my time, it was easy 
  enough to go abroad, romanticise the 'Boys' and lose sight of the real dangers.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-AU
style='font-size:12.0pt;'>It was again my Marxist colleagues who brought home 
  to me the reality that the very respectable non-violence that we in Tamil society 
  had imbibed from the Federal Party was moribund. It was singularly lacking in 
  honour and conviction. It easily became a means of escapism where one surrendered 
  the initiative to violent elements and applauded secretly. To use non-violence 
  as a means of struggle, an organisation needs to build up traditions and mechanisms, 
  both to confront state oppression as well as to check violence by their own 
  side. What we had was no more than a verbal commitment to non-violence that 
  was averse to any personal risk.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-AU
style='font-size:12.0pt;'>A violent struggle involves imposing a heavy burden 
  on the life and well being of others, and the moral degradation it brings will 
  last for generations. Yet, faced with the reality of violent state oppression, 
  one cannot but respect someone who took up arms out of a genuine sense of responsibility. 
  Such persons can be challenged only by demonstrating the viability of active 
  non-violent resistance. It requires a relentless pursuit of justice in every 
  sphere of life. This can happen only when there is elbowroom for autonomous 
  non-violent action. This opening in Tamil society was squeezed out in the mid-1980s 
  by a fascist order. It reduced its living opponents to individuals, who operated 
  in chosen narrow spheres without any possibility of organisation.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-AU
style='font-size:12.0pt;'>The struggle itself degenerated into pure violence without 
  any prospect of liberation. A poignant example of its present relationship to 
  its cadre is that of sometimes sending out explosive-strapped suicide bombers 
  who are blasted by remote control. The foregoing gives a brief sketch of what 
  I gained from my colleagues in <i>The Broken Palmyra</i> and the UTHR(J) over 
  many eventful years, and where the community finds itself today.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-AU
style='font-size:12.0pt;'>In comparison with those of my time who had greater 
  freedom to reflect, the minds of Tamils who were born after the mid-1960s have 
  been formed by the experience of conflict and humiliation. For many of those 
  born from the early 70s, their experience has been one of unrelieved tragedy. 
  This casts a heavier responsibility on those of us who grew up in more tranquil 
  times.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-AU
style='font-size:12.0pt;'>As I hinted earlier, I was a passive Federal Party supporter 
  by upbringing, looking to Chelvanayakam with a sense of awe. Like the others 
  of my time, I shared in the elation when the Federal Party leaders commemorated 
  the birth of Bangladesh in a public meeting at the Jaffna Town Hall. That was 
  in December 1971. Like many others I became less passive after the communal 
  violence of 1977. I was part of a small expatriate group that tied up with the 
  Tamil Refugees Rehabilitation Organisation and came to know its secretary K. 
  Kanthasamy, a committed man who worked hard and lived very sparingly. On two 
  occasions I spent a day with the Rajasundarams who ran the Gandhiyam in Vavuniya.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-AU
style='font-size:12.0pt;'>I was associated with the Standing Committee of Tamils 
  in London when after the burning of the Jaffna Public Library in 1981, a group 
  within the SCOT launched the <i>Tamil Times</i>. During this period very few 
  expatriates supported the militancy at home. An important reason for this was 
  that Amirthalingam kept reassuring the expatriates that a political solution 
  could be found. Thus the communal violence of July 1983 combined with the effective 
  expulsion of the TULF from Parliament, marked a watershed.</span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-AU>Many of us felt the blow as the BBC announced 
  the Welikade prison massacres and the murder of Dr. Rajasundaram. It put an 
  end to the kind of peaceful activity where expatriates supported groups like 
  the TRRO. Many argued that supporting refugees was useless without a solution 
  to the problem. Some moved on to support the armed militant groups. Those who 
  disagreed were once more reduced to observers. Even when we disagreed, we generally, 
  at that time at least, remained friends.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-AU
style='font-size:12.0pt;'>Returning to Jaffna in 1985, I became involved with 
  the <i>Saturday Review</i> on Kanthasamy&#146;s suggestion. Although Gamini 
  Navaratne was the editor, much of the day-to-day editorial work was done by 
  A.J. Canagaratna. By that time there was growing disillusionment with the militancy. 
  It was A.J. Canagaratna, a Marxist and a journalist with very long experience, 
  who led me to question my implicit trust in the old Federal Party, whose pretensions 
  to non-violence were wearing thin by the early 1970s. A.J. is one of those unsung 
  heroes who hated hypocrisy and murder, and kept his inner integrity through 
  very trying times.</span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-AU>We all witnessed with horror another watershed 
  &#150; the mass murder of TELO members by the LTTE in early May 1986. We were 
  all talking about it and Gamini Navaratne suggested that I write the editorial. 
  It was one that was strong by the standards of those cautious times. I then 
  also met P. Jayaram of the United News of India and blurted out everything I 
  had seen and heard. It contributed to a feature that was widely carried. By 
  this time my nationalism had reached vanishing point. An influence which contributed 
  to this was the writings of Karl Popper.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-AU
style='font-size:12.0pt;'>By the end of 1986 Rajini and Sritharan had returned 
  from Britain after completing their doctoral studies. So began the saga that 
  resulted in <i>The Broken Palmyra</i> and then the UTHR (Jaffna).</span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-AU>I mentioned the foregoing because these 
  associations indicate how the scope of the book falls into place. They cover 
  the years in which I was in some way actively involved in the events concerning 
  destiny of the Tamil community. Most of the time I was hardly more than an observer. 
  But I knew several of the actors, respected their dedication and shared their 
  hopes. The untimely death of several of them left a void that is also personal. 
  The book in general deals with or touches most of the major events that confronted 
  a person of my time.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:12.0pt;'>Writing a book of this nature often 
  comes with an inner compulsion to withdraw &#150; to disengage, before one&#146;s 
  mental and physical faculties are run down. One may perhaps like to believe 
  in the perennial counsel of John Milton:</span></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><span lang=EN-AU>My chief resources for published materials in writing this 
    book were the libraries of the Nadesan Centre and the Civil Rights Movement, 
    Colombo. The press-cuttings covering this period filed by the latter proved 
    an accessible and invaluable guide to crucial developments from the 1980s. 
    I have also availed myself of the documentary resources of the International 
    Centre for Ethnic Studies and the Marga Institute, Colombo. All these institutions 
    have been very generous in helping me to use their materials.</span></p>
  <p><span lang=EN-AU>In writing this book I have benefited from the kindness 
    of many. The children Abiran, Kathya, Tania, Nadheeran and Mayuri saved me 
    from monotony. I was greatly helped by materials, information and valuable 
    advice given to me by Suriya Wickremasinghe in writing especially the sections 
    dealing with the Welikade prison massacres. Gnana Hemasiri and Claire Wickremasinghe 
    who are librarians at the Nadesan Centre bore with me very patiently in my 
    numerous requests for books, reports, filings of paper cuttings and photocopies. 
    Mr. Thambirajah, the librarian of the International Centre for Ethnic Studies, 
    has been readily forthcoming whenever I applied to him for materials. I am 
    greatly indebted to Mr. George Gnanamuttu for enlightening me on matters now 
    fading from living memory and for invaluable materials in his possession. 
    He also gave me guidance for further search. I am also grateful to my uncle 
    Dick Hensman for valuable insight into the July 1983 violence and some materials 
    in his possession. Both Nalin Swaris and T. Sabaratnam gave me their time 
    as well as their knowledge of crucial historical events. Wimal Fernando and 
    Shiral Laktilleke helped me to clarify past events in the South. Waruna Karunatilleke, 
    Qadri Ismail, Lucian Rajakarunayake and S. Manoranjan, who are journalists, 
    have helped me by answering queries and obtaining further information at my 
    request.</span></p>
  <p><span lang=EN-AU>After much fruitless search, it was Mr. Kurumbasiddy R. 
    Kanagaratnam of the International Tamils' Archives, Kandy, who provided me 
    a copy of a rare document dealing with the 1977 violence. The Tamil community 
    owes Mr. Kanagaratnam a debt for his perseverance and commitment in setting 
    up these archives. The late Mr.A. Thangathurai MP gave me invaluable understanding 
    into the problems of some of the difficult areas of the East during many conversations 
    I had with him over several years. Despite our disagreements, TULF MPs Mr.R. 
    Sampanthan and Mr. Anandasangari have kindly obliged me with information and 
    documents from their party archives whenever I requested it. </span></p>
  <p><span lang=EN-AU>Mr. Bradman Weerakoon readily agreed to my request to talk 
    to him and patiently answered my questions over a number of visits. Mr. Bala 
    Tampoe of the Ceylon Mercantile Union provided me with some very valuable 
    information together with internal documents concerning the July 1983 violence. 
    There are a number of others who gave me their time and answered my queries, 
    not all whose names have been mentioned here, but the reader would find their 
    names occurring in the text. Some others gave me information on condition 
    of confidentiality.</span></p>
  <p><span lang=EN-AU
style='font-size:12.0pt;'>The typing of this manuscript would have proved a nightmare 
    if not for the help of a young lady, who apart from doing it devotedly on 
    top of her work and family obligations, patiently put up with re-drafting 
    and re-typing in several places. Miss. Sangeetha Nesiah and Miss. Venuri Perera 
    too helped me with the typing and typed sections of the book. Mrs. Indrakanthi 
    Perera helped me by translating documents from the Sinhalese. </span></p>
  <p><span lang=EN-AU>Nothing that I have written took its final form without 
    the incisive criticism and changes suggested by my colleague Sritharan and 
    others who are close to me. Miss. Ramani Muttetuwegama kindly went through 
    some of the chapters and sections where I had doubts, suggested redrafting 
    and gave me advice on staying within the Law.</span></p>
  <p><span lang=EN-AU>The last chapter has been the most difficult to write and 
    went through several drafts. It involved selecting tendencies from a fast 
    changing reality that are likely to have a bearing on future and discussing 
    remedial measures. To this end I must thank several individuals, particularly 
    those in Jaffna whom I cannot name, who have also helped in many other ways. 
    The writing of this book was a voluntary undertaking. The cost of printing 
    and some other miscellanies was paid for by a donor who does not wish to be 
    named.</span><a href="#top">[Top]</a></p>
