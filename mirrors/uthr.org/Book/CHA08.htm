up to July 1983, as indicated in the last chapter, the Judiciary had been
browbeaten and a clear message had gone down to judges who valued career
advancement. After the Referendum, it meant waiting a further six years for a
possible change of government. We now go into a few cases of how Tamil
detainees under the PTA were faring at the hands of this combination of the
Judiciary and the Attorney Generals department. This has a significant bearing
on the gory fate that overtook 53 of the detainees.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

including Mr. Varatharajaperumal, a member of the academic staff of the
University of Jaffna, were produced before the Colombo Fort Magistrate S.I.
Imam on 21<sup>st</sup> June 1983. They had been detained in the neighbourhood
of Batticaloa on 1<sup>st</sup> April. On that occasion Varatharajaperumal who
was not attached to any group then, had conducted classes on Marxist theory on
the outskirts of Batticaloa for young members of the EPRLF as part of the Marx
centenary observances. The exercise books on which the youth took notes were
sent by the Police for translation as possible evidence of terrorist activity.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the Court that some were caught while selling the book <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

translation. More time was asked to prepare charges. The counsel representing
the detainees demanded their release as no charges were forthcoming after 81
days. But order was reserved by the Magistrate for a further 7 days.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

absolutely no doubt that the AGs department knew that there could be no valid
charges. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Lanka Rani</i>, a book
published by Arular in 1978 had enjoyed a wide circulation. The story is based
on Tamil refugees from the 1977 violence sailing to Jaffna from Colombo aboard
the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Lanka Rani</i> and explores the theme
of how the Tamils were led to the demand for separation. Even under the Sixth
Amendment to the Constitution which was not yet in existence, it is hard to see
how promoting the book could have been an offence.</span></p>

State had become so alien to the Tamil speaking people (25% of the populace),
that it had no trusted officials in the AGs department or the Police to assess
what was being written in Tamil. To the State Counsel, mentioning the title of
a Tamil book seemed the equivalent of proffering a criminal charge. One is
reminded of how the university authorities at Peradeniya jumped to the
conclusion that Balasooriyan was a Tiger (Sect. 4.7).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

The trial by media of Gandhiyam leaders had begun in November 82, and in
retrospect, after the prison massacre, even a sentence of death had been passed
with Press complicity. This campaign was undoubtedly articulated by Jayewardene
himself on the advice of someone close to him. K.W. Devanayagam had little
reason to be excited about Gandhiyams work in the North, and in 1975, when the
UNP was in the opposition, had even co-operated with groups close to the
Gandhiyam in settling displaced Hill-Country Tamils around Batticaloa.
Jayewardene had Devanayagams undated resignation letter in his pocket, from 28<sup>th</sup>
October 1982, leaving Devanayagam with an unenviable choice if he were to
contradict the boss. It may also be noted that Devanayagam subsequently
accompanied Gamini Dissanayake in the meeting with government agents just
before the July 83 violence where threatening noises were made against
refugees looked after by Gandhiyam in the Trincomalee District.</span><span

injuries as a result of torture and moreover the case had created much
international interest and concern. In the meantime, there being no viable
charges, the two had been basely maligned in Parliament under parliamentary
privilege by leading ministers. A self-respecting judge should have made a
point by fixing the trial at the earliest opportunity and having the case
dismissed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

court! Asked about their counsel, the accused said that they would retain their
own counsel from the next date. Judge Bandaranayake fixed a calling date for 5<sup>th</sup>
September (5 months from arrest!) and said that he would then fix a trial date.
One concession the Judge made to the detainees was to issue an order
transferring them to fiscal custody at the remand section of Welikade Prison,
from their maximum security prison conditions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

accused were not transferred to remand custody. Perhaps they themselves did not
want to be separated from their companions. Five days after the court
appearance Rajasundaram was killed in the second prison massacre, and Senior
State Counsel de Silvas role changed to one of leading evidence at an inquest
that was held solely for the purpose of covering up the States culpability. In
view of the role of the Judiciary in implementing bad laws without protest, the
intentions of the State as revealed in a press item on 12<sup>th</sup> June
(Sect. 8.7), and the circumstances of the Welikade prison massacre (Chapter
11); whether Rajasundaram was a victim in part of judicial murder remains a

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>This proposal may seem
superfluous in the context as Emergency Regulation 15A came into force on 3<sup>rd</sup>
June when the PSO was brought into effect. This regulation enabled the disposal
of dead bodies without inquest with the perpetrators maintaining anonymity 
i.e. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>the freedom of battle field</i>.
The new proposal is interesting because it was largely superfluous. It
addressed itself particularly to terrorist suspects supposedly breaking
jail. Also envisaged was an army presence near the suspects.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>The relevant context in
which this proposal was made was the transfer of Tamil detainees from army
custody at Panagoda camp to fiscal custody at Welikade jail. This was after the
Judicial Medical Officer, Dr. Salgado, examined Dr. Rajasundaram who was held
at Panagoda camp and confirmed that he had sustained injuries from torture. The
Court was petitioned and the other detainees too expressed a wish to be
transferred to fiscal custody. But the Ministry of Defence took it in bad
spirit as evident from the testimony of Don Kulasekera Perera Balasuriya (58)
who testified at the inquest after the second prison massacre in July. Mr
Balasuriya who was administrative officer MoD/dossiers and detainees, said that
charges of mistreatment made by the detainees were baseless, but the Government
had acceded to the transfer from military to fiscal custody. The transfers as
testified by him took place as follows: the first batch of 25 transferred from
Panagoda to Welikade on 3<sup>rd</sup> June 1983 and fresh detention orders
issued. Six detainees transferred on 6<sup>th</sup> June. The final batch of 27
was transferred on 14<sup>th</sup> June.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>The proposal which surfaced
on 12<sup>th</sup> June appears to be a response to these transfers. Although
strictly speaking they were at Welikade under fiscal custody, a platoon of
troops was placed outside the gates ostensibly to prevent their escape. A
similar arrangement had been made earlier when suspects in the 1962 coup
attempt were detained.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>A notable feature of the
proposal was its suddenness as though the Government suddenly realised that
there was an endemic problem of dangerous Tamil prisoners escaping. There was
no such problem. The prisoners were brought to the South into alien
surroundings. Escape was exceptional. Thambapillai Maheswaran had earlier
escaped from Panagoda and was caught. Most had no desire to escape. They were
political prisoners and were reasonably confident of being released through the
courts. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>This sudden concern with
dangerous prisoners escaping was therefore totally unwarranted and the measures
of indemnity were extra-ordinary - extraordinary because if it were a question
of armed jail busting no one would question the use of arms to prevent it. Thus
the situation envisaged in the proposal dealt with hypothetical unarmed
escapees. Where the effect of this proposal differed from ER 15A is that<i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> some of these powers are to remain in
force even after the Emergency is lifted.</i> This is to say the key
provisions would remain part of the law of the land under the Prevention of
Terrorism Act.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>Under the PTA arrests could
be made without warrant and the detainees could be kept in undisclosed locations
indefinitely with no rules governing conditions of detention and interrogation.
Combined with the proposed amendment, it would have amounted to a licence to
murder. Perhaps the Government moved slowly because its human rights record was
coming under criticism worldwide after reports by AI and the ICJ. The <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Sun</i> reported on 6<sup>th</sup> July, 19
days before the violence, that the Government is likely to make a series of
far-reaching amendments to the PTA. One might conclude that these intentions
were overtaken by events.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>From the pointed reference
to terrorist suspects and the essential superfluousness of the move, we may
infer that it reflected a state of mind within the ruling class rather than a
need  the same could have been done under a State of Emergency, that is,
nearly always. The rulers had decided that the most expedient way to deal with
terrorist suspects is to kill them, and the proposed amendments to the PTA
were a message to this effect. It is hard to resist the inference that this
state of mind is inseparable from the massacres at Welikade jail and the
broader violence in general. After all, the Tamils as a whole had been
repeatedly portrayed as being agents of terrorism while at the same time having
it good under the open economy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>Thus by 23<sup>rd</sup> July,
several trends were converging towards an extra-judicial blow-up. The
Government had apparently rolled up the political map in the South, and this
very success, combined with its authoritarianism, was making it more angry
about its lack of control in the North. Though having only minute resources in
comparison with the State, the very notion that there should be a Gandhiyam
trying to counter its own agenda drove the Government towards violent measures.
The courts were themselves acting as though they were unable to decide whether
their function was to try the so-called terrorist suspects and release nearly
all of them or to prolong their detention under conditions of uncertainty. The
Judiciary and the AGs department too must take a share of responsibility for
the harrowing fate of the detainees, if one grants that the State had given an
indication of its intentions and that detentions were being prolonged without
valid reason. Last but not the least, an illegitimate government was looking
for a diversion, and the main opposition and leading elements of the society at
large, swallowed the bait in an attempt, actively or passively, to demonstrate
their ideological conformity.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the time Jayewardene gave the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Daily
Telegraph</i> his extra-ordinary interview, a plan had been discussed at the
highest levels and the wheels were moving. An indication of how the law
authorities, security forces and police would conduct themselves in the event
of a violent communal outbreak in which elements of the State took the lead was
contained in the episode of demonstrations against supreme court judges.
Although no one was physically hurt, the affront towards leading symbols of the
Law also contained in it the States contempt for the Law. It was widely known
that the demonstration was the work of UNP shock troops in the form of its
trade union, the JSS.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>Jayewardene had an alibi,
having been out of the country. To the ministers it seemed to have been a
practical joke. When a man came forward as the organiser of the demonstrations,
the Attorney General could not make up his mind about proceeding against the
man. The Police were taking cover behind the fact that no one came forward to
give evidence  who would, when they knew the Government to be the culprit?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

said that names had been given anonymously implicating the governing partys

concerning Tamil detainees that was surfacing in the highest circles at this
time, the killing of at least 20 detainees in Vavuniya on 2nd December 1984
provides a vivid illustration. This was the time the newly formed Media
Committee under Dr. Wickrema Weerasooriya, an Australian national and
brother-in-law of Gamini Dissanayake, was having its trial run. At a press
conference held at the defence ministry (<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Island</i>
4.12.84) he announced that 32 terrorists were killed in two operations. 12 were
killed in army operations around Kent and Dollar Farms. (Surely the twelve were
not Tigers - who conducted a massacre there 3 days earlier and would not have
around when the security forces arrived!) In the second incident according to
Dr. Weerasooriya, 20 terrorists were killed (the BBC said 30) and 2 wounded
when terrorists attempted to attack the Northern Command HQ at Vavuniya. The
terrorists killed were said by Dr. Weerasooriya to be those under detention at
the camp who attempted to escape during the attack.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>The purpose of the attack,
he said, was to rescue the terrorists detained at the Centre. The terrorists
from outside who launched the attack fled upon the soldiers opening fire. None
of them, he said, was killed in the attack. One soldier guarding the Command
Centre also died in the battle, he added.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

itself. Doctor Weerasooriya, it is said, was removed from his media role not
long afterwards. About 3 weeks earlier Lalith Athulathmudali was in Vavuniya as
National Security Minister for the opening of the new JOSSOP (Joint Special
Services Operations) building. He was shown talking to captured 'terrorists'
who were said to be pouring out their heart to him in the manner of repentant
sinners.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

survivor said that several of those killed belonged to the PLOTE. There was an
escape plan, it is said, which was leaked and several of the prisoners were
killed. Some were badly beaten. There was no attack from outside. This report
came from a survivor whose legs were broken. The incident is again a reflection
of the press item cited from the Island of 12th June 1983, and suggests that
such ways of dealing with the more spirited prisoners had become part of the
mental make-up of the system. What began with Tamils in 1983 became a flood
when dealing with Sinhalese youth from 1988.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
