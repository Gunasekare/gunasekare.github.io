is clear that under natural ecological conditions intra-species aggression is
seen in defence of territory or as nature's solution to over-population.

being some inborn inhibition to killing. It is pertinent to ask why such
inhibitions do not operate in man, virtually the only 'unhinged killer'...there

to the District Development Councils were scheduled for early June 1981. These
were being hailed by the Government and its supporters as a means to finding a
political solution to the Tamil problem. Despite this, the UNP government of
the day chose a strange way to usher in the DDCs. It may be explained, in part,
as a perverse reaction to the attack on UNP and non-TULF candidates by Tamil
militants, and the TULF's silence on these. These included the killing of Mr.
Thiagarajah, former MP for Vaddukoddai, and some policemen. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

train-load of election staff was sent from the South, many of whom did not have
a clue to what election duty meant. The train stopped at Kurunegala. Minister.
G.M. Premachandra, and Jayewickrema Perera, both top UNPers, addressed the
election staff through loud speakers. They told them, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>&quot;You are our frontier forces, you must come back with
victory.&quot; </i>This trumpet-call was recounted by a man from Galle, who was
then on election duty. He was reminded of this while witnessing the violence at
the North-Western Provincial Council elections under the PA government in 1999.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Jaffna there was a high-powered team including Ministers Gamini Dissanayake,
Cyril Mathew &amp; Festus Perera, G.P.V. Samarasinghe, secretary to the
cabinet, Chandrananda de Silva, later commissioner of elections and
subsequently defence secretary, and Colonel Dharmapala, defence secretary.
There were also a large number of policemen brought into Jaffna under DIG
Edward Gunawardene. The mindset implicit in this exercise also throws some
light on the 1983 violence. Gamini Dissanayake addressed the election staff. He
told them, according to the man from Galle above, to close the polling booths
at 10.00 AM and cast the remaining votes. Some innocent guy asked him, &quot;<i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>For whom should we cast them?&quot;</i> The
Minister replied, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>&quot;Why, to the

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>The
operation was so botched up that the UNP got no benefit out of it. A high point
of the exercise was the burning of the Jaffna Public Library by Edward
Gunawardene's men. There had of course been militant attacks on policemen. But
the considered opinion of some senior police colleagues was that Ponnambalam
(Brute) Mahendran, who was DIG, Jaffna, would have handled the situation
competently if not for the presence of Gunawardene and his men. The operation
did achieve, however, something notable. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

this time, with all the reservations the Tamils had about the State, there was
hope that a political solution would be arrived at through negotiations between
the Government and the TULF. The Government's conduct during the elections to
the DDCs - the much awaited political solution - greatly tarnished that hope.
Two months later there was anti-Tamil violence in the South where the President
himself blamed a section of his own party. The outrage among the Tamils occasioned
by the burning of the library and the press of the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Eelanadu</i> - the only independent provincial daily in this country -
was smothered in the Colombo press. What was left of liberal traditions could
not be contained by the developing polarisation in the country. To responsible
Tamils, both here and abroad, it seemed clear that the Tamils needed English
journals of their own to highlight their concerns.<span style="mso-spacerun:

Despite the misrepresentation in this country, it has been a responsible and
moderate monthly, which never supported the separatist cause in its editorial

idea of a frontier thrust had been discernible from the 1950s in closed
official circles, but in the early 80s, it became part of the conscious and
deliberate overtones of the Accelerated Mahaveli Programme. This was the key
project of the Jayewardene Government of 1977, and was placed under Gamini
Dissanayake. The mixed and confused objectives of the programme can be
discerned from the following quotation from Patrick Peebles (Colonization and
Ethnic Conflict in the Dry Zone of Sri Lanka, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Journal of Asian Studies</i>, February 1990):<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'> &quot;As late as May 1982 Mahaweli project officials claimed that Dry
Zone settlements would defuse ethnic tension by reducing unemployment. They
were unduly optimistic. Earlier colonization schemes had divided the Sinhalese
majority and the Tamil minority long before either Mahaveli River development
or ethnic violence accelerated... The UNP consciously evoked the image of an
idyllic Buddhist past in which the Dry Zone irrigation provided the resources
for a prosperous and cultured civilization. Officials of the Accelerated
Mahaveli Programme appealed directly to this mythical past, in which Tamil
Hindu invaders were hated enemies, to mobilize Buddhist support&quot;. </i>What
was most contentious was land settlement within the largely Tamil speaking
North-East.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>The
atmosphere of that time was full of populist overtones, offering to the
Sinhalese poor through land settlement the twin goals of economic prosperity
and putting the Tamils in their place. It had something of the idealism and the
tragedy of the European crusades of the Middle Ages. To a circle among the
Colombo elite within and close to the ruling UNP establishment, generally in
their late 30s and 40s, securing strategic land by proxy became a heroic
obsession. In particular, after the July 1983 violence, they used their
personal influence to divert state resources to this end, giving rise to armed
Sinhalese border villages. Violence and massacres by both sides escalated from
1984, and instead of the prosperity promised to them, these Sinhalese villagers
became civilian shields and chattels of the armed forces.<span

workers being disbanded by the British Navy and from other war-related

leaving Gal Oya. Mr. Kanagasundaram, a Tamil, who was the chairman of the Gal

against the Bandaranaike-Chelvanayakam Pact signed in July 1957. With the
signing of the Pact, Chelvanayakam called off a satyagraha (a non-violent)
campaign he was threatening to wage - the Federal Party then had a mass base.
In response to this intended non-violent campaign, government politicians had
called upon the settlers in Padaviya to prepare for a Tamil invasion from
Trincomalee - in other words to form a strike force. But after the signing of
the Pact things calmed down, and the Minister of Lands (C.P. de Silva) ordered
400 downstream allotments in the Trincomalee District to be given to Tamil
families who were losing their jobs at the Trincomalee Dockyard owing to the
pullout of the British Navy. However, the vigilance committees of these already
emotionally charged Padaviya settlers forcibly occupied these allotments.
During the 1958 violence, these vigilance committees led by ex-servicemen
attempted to attack Tamil refugees in Anuradhapura. They were thwarted by firm
Police and Army action in which 11 of them were killed. (See Vittachi.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

publicity impact was subdued by the isolation of the area. Kantalai erupted
during the 1977 violence claiming the lives of 30 Tamils. What was once
advanced as the Island's granary was yielding a bitter harvest of blood and
bitterness. It had reduced the Tamils to living under an ever-present threat of
violence and in total distrust of the State - even when they sometimes found it
useful to vote UNP or SLFP for reasons of survival amidst uncertainty. These

which the Tamils have been progressively excluded from any real influence. One
manifestation of the agenda is that in both the Amparai and Trincomalee

the 1970s, and certainly more so by the 80s, serious doubts had begun to be
expressed the world over about the viability of agricultural schemes involving
the transplantation of huge populations under centralised direction, giant
reservoirs, deforestation and the accompanying unplanned migration. Their
political and social consequences, whether planned or unplanned, deliberate or
accidental, have tended towards causing conflict. The late Mahee Wickremaratne
was a civil servant who worked on the Gal Oya scheme and later, on the Mahaveli
scheme. In a private conversation, he commented on the fate of some of the
Tamil and Muslim villages that were already there in the area of the Gal Oya
scheme - called earlier the Pattipalai Aru scheme. He observed that in order to
attract settlers, the villages constructed under the scheme were recipients of
modern infrastructure and other facilities, while the older villages (including
Sinhalese ones) already there were neglected. It is known that they suffered
also in terms of representation and the language in which they were served
changed from Tamil to Sinhalese.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

there were unforeseen environmental changes resulting from drastic
topographical transformation. Padaviya reservoir often runs short of water due
to adverse changes in rainfall. The Muslim and Tamil farmers in the
Kantalai-Thampalakamam area were getting their water from the Kantalai
reservoir long before the scheme was implemented in the 1950s. They are now
mainly at the lower end of the scheme. They complain of not being given enough
water when there is a lack of rain, and being flooded out by water released
from the reservoir when there is an excess of rain.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

was perhaps most defective about these schemes was that they came from the
vision of an authoritarian ruling class trying to recreate their idea of a

which they saw themselves as aristocratic benefactors. The legitimisation of
this scheme of things was based on the historical reading of Sri Lanka in
ancient times as a prosperous unitary state, ruled centrally by benevolent
kings who built and maintained reservoirs and fostered Buddhism. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Now it is done. A recent study by the Ministry of Forestry and Environment and
the Mahaveli Development Authority found Victoria, Kotmale, Rantambe,
Randenigala and Polgolla reservoirs choking with silt. Rantambe is the worst
affected, having silted by 56% in 9 years, followed by Polgolla (47%). The rest,
taken together lost more than 2 million cubic metres (1500-acre feet) of
capacity. The main cause is said to be an unforeseen level of deforestation in
the upper catchment areas. In consequence the hydro-power anticipated is
reduced and maintenance (because of silt) becomes costly (Shanika Sriyananda in
the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Sunday Observer</i> 5.12.1999).
Managing the system now requires huge unplanned costs. It is a story resembling
the recent political history of Sri Lanka.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

deals with economic phenomena in colonised areas. A significant feature
mentioned is that of hidden tenancy. This results when a farmer is unable to
make ends meet or repay his loans and his land is in effect given on rent or
ceded unofficially to a provider of capital. The owner thus often becomes a
paid labourer in his own land. This was found to be by 1990, 30 to 40% in
Mahaveli lands settled in the 70s, and 5 to 10% in recent settlements. The

one, and applies largely on account of the ethnic polarisation that prevails in
the country at large. A Sinhalese officer when posted to Trincomalee as GA,
knows that he is part of an agenda and the Government can influence the conduct
of an administrator through a range of rewards and punishments. A Tamil officer
marked for a certain zeal in ensuring that his Tamil clients get the best
possible deal, may find himself refused the routine extension of service upon
reaching the age of 55. (See our Special Report No.8.) In carrying out the kind

Siva) in the Tamil name <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Thirukonamalai </i>(Trincomalee)

Paranavitana's successor as archaeological commissioner, who was then retired,

shrine of Siva. It was by then well known that remains of the shrine, apart

Both are in Sanskrit (as distinct from Pali, the sacred language of the Theravada

inspiration. The one in Thiriyai, written in the Pallava Grantha script, speaks
of sea-faring merchants and of the shrine's foundation by guilds of merchants.
This was also the period when the rival faiths of Hinduism, Jainism and
Buddhism were vying with each other in the South-Indian region. We thus learn a
good deal about the contemporary fame of all these shrines and of how
Gnanasambandar came to know so much about Koneswaram. These shrines were

their property and security. Several ministries and ministers were involved,
and they launched on a spree of land acquisition. 5000 acres along a long
stretch of the Colombo Road leading from town were brought under the Ports
Authority of which not even 100 acres have been used. Land totalling several
thousands of acres, was acquired by the Tourist Board, Petroleum Corporation
and several other state bodies. The linchpin of these efforts was Government

and went up to Minister Gamini Dissanayake, whom he had known as a junior
lawyer, and complained about it. With characteristic courtesy, in the presence
of Sampanthan the Minister made out a written order cancelling the settlement.
Bandaragoda was then GA Trinco. It was soon learnt that Nanda Abeyawickreme,
Secretary Lands, had sent phone messages to the Trincomalee Kacheri, asking for
the settlement to be speeded up. This was done so that the formal order to stop
would be anticipated by a fait accompli. There was little the Tamils could do

of Vilgam Temple had a number of Tamil inscriptions, and those at Kuchchaveli

the State was that these ruins were proof of the region's Theravada-Sinhalese

Tamils. Neelapanikkan Kulam, a tank near the village, was renovated about the
1940s, and the villagers had since been cultivating the fields nearby. There is
an old Buddhist shrine close to Thiriyai and another nearby in Mylaweva on the
Thiriyai-Gomarankadawela Road, which has Tamil inscriptions. But the
cultivation of the fields referred to, had not been regularised by the issue of

news. In official secrecy unknown to the villagers or their representatives,
2000 acres of land in Thiriyai had been earmarked for the Cadju Corporation.
And one day out of the blue, Corporation officials with tractors, labourers and
cashew plants descended on the villagers to convert their rice fields into a

absurdity to use irrigated paddy land for cashew. Cashew is normally planted on
dry and poorer soil closer to the sea. The Minister was taken aback. They asked
him who was responsible? The Minister answered that the order had come from the
very top and that he was helpless in the matter. However the Minister suggested
that he would ask Mr. Ekanayake, the Chairman of the Corporation, to go on a

features. The GAs were to be empowered to use the Police, Army or Navy in doing
the dirty work. What was the Navy doing here? It naturally fell into place
because of the valuable combat experience it had acquired for this work in
Trincomalee during June &amp; July 1983. Here we have the origins of JOSSOP.
Because the latter had its head quarters in Vavuniya where the Air Force had a
facility, it too was drafted into the job of chasing and corralling Plantation
Tamils. Note also the crucial role here for the Sinhalese GA in Trincomalee.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

of demographic transformation, whose beginning, although hidden by the violence
of July 1983, was part of the same programme and was no less insidious. This
will be taken up in Chapters 14 &amp; 20.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
