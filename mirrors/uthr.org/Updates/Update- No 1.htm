<h2 align=center style='text-align:center'>UTHR(J) Up Date : <span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Schoolbook;'></span>20th 
  July 2003</h2>
<h2 align=center style='text-align:center'><a name="top"></a>New Twists in East&#146;s 
  Continuing Tragedy</h2>
<p><b>The LTTE&#146;s campaign of violence against its critics has driven many 
  Tamil political activists from their homes</b>. Since P. Alahathurai, the EPRLF 
  (V)&#146;s Porativu Local Council chairman, was abducted and killed by the LTTE 
  last December, a number of other local councillors opposed to the LTTE have 
  met a similar fate. As the danger became clear, many families of political 
  activists fled to the precincts of Batticaloa to live close to security forces 
  camps hoping this would provide some safety. But even in such areas the LTTE 
  has acted with impunity. Those individuals under most direct threat left their 
  families and moved to party offices, which had police protection, and visited 
  their homes for short intervals. But this too turned out to be hazardous, as 
  was the case for Ponniah Ramachandran of the EPDP, who was gunned down while 
  returning to his Batticaloa office on 15<sup>th</sup> June 2003.</p>
<p>As in Ponniah Ramachandran&#146;s case, PLOTE local councillor Vairamuthu Meganathan 
  (32) was gunned down by the LTTE while going home from his party office in Pudur, 
  off Batticaloa, on 4<sup>th</sup> July. He died while being taken to Batticaloa 
  Hospital. The following day on the way to the cremation grounds, the relatives 
  took Meganathan&#146;s body to the Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission (SLMM) office 
  and demanded assurances from them that such attacks on opposition parties would 
  be stopped. The SLMM refused, saying that it is a matter for the Police. When 
  the SSP Police arrived, they asked him for an assurance that they would act 
  to stop these killings and would further launch a full investigation into all 
  cases of political abduction and murder. The SSP gave some partial assurances. 
  A news report a few days later said that the SLMM office has been given police 
  protection against further protests!</p>
<p>In this context, where killings of the LTTE&#146;s Tamil political opponents 
  are occurring regularly (almost daily for several weeks in June 2003) and they 
  receive little or no active investigation by the Police or the SLMM, the task 
  of identifying perpetrators is left to the community itself, and justice is 
  unlikely to be served. Eventually, as embattled as they are, the LTTE&#146;s 
  opponents may start fighting back.</p>
<p>On 11 July, Vellupillai Paraneetharan, a young member of the LTTE was shot 
  dead, again in Pudur. It is suspected that he was killed by a member of PLOTE, 
  although first indications were that he was punished by the LTTE itself for 
  misbehavior.</p>
<p>According to sources in the area, Paraneetharan, though an active member of 
  the LTTE using the freedom under the MoU to the full, also had problems with 
  his group. These included, reportedly, misbehaviour with a female recruit, suspicion 
  that he had divulged sensitive information under recent police custody and embezzling 
  money extorted for the group. These sources also said that Paraneetharan had 
  been taken to the Tharavai LTTE base and questioned two weeks earlier. These 
  gave rise to the suspicion that it was an inside job.</p>
<p>Notable among Paraneethanran&#146;s recent activities was aiding the killers 
  of Navasooriyan of Military Intelligence on 19<sup>th</sup> May, who, after 
  being pointed out by Paraneetharan while having a haircut in a Batticaloa saloon, 
  was shot by two gun men. The latter escaped reportedly leaving the weapon with 
  Paraneetharan. The following day Paraneetharan was involved in an attempt to 
  abduct the 12-year-old son of the deceased for their army. The attempt was foiled 
  by relatives who screamed and later identified Paraneetharan to the Police. 
  It was for this that he spent some time in police custody.</p>
<p>Paraneetharan had also been seen acting as pointer when LTTE gunmen shot PLOTE 
  local councillor Meganathan. UTHR(J) now has reliable information that Paraneetharan 
  was killed by a member of the PLOTE. However, the PLOTE leadership has been 
  very timid in confronting the LTTE politically and the incident may point to 
  other forces at work. While Meganathan was the first member of the PLOTE to 
  be killed under the MoU, there have been several murders and abductions of Military 
  Intelligence personnel. With the MoU almost in tatters, we may be seeing the 
  beginnings of another dangerous twist.</p>
<h3>Attacks on the families of Tamil opposition group members</h3>
<h4>The two incidents that follow are the first we know of the LTTE deliberately 
  targeting family members of opposition groups since February 2002:</h4>
<p><b>Murugamoorthy Thushyanthini, wife of Arafat, PLOTE</b></p>
<p>Arafat is a member of the PLOTE who now lives in the Batticaloa party office. 
  His wife Murugamoorthy Thushyanthini lived close to the army camp in Chenkalady 
  with her one year old child. Five members of the LTTE went to her home on 14<sup>th</sup> 
  July. While three waited outside, two men, Vithya and Uma, went in and assaulted 
  Thushanthini brutally. </p>
<p><b>Sivapunniam Rathirani, wife of Murugesu Varatharajah (37) of the EPRLF(V)</b></p>
<p>Murugesu Varatharajah (38) of the EPRLF(V) was vice chairman of the Porativu 
  local council. After the chairman Alahathurai was killed by the LTTE, he left 
  Mandur with his family and went to live in Kallady close to an Army presence. 
  His neighbour was Thangarasa Ramachandran of Mankadu, Chettipalayam, another 
  member of the EPRLF(V) who had to flee his village. Just after 8.00 PM on 5<sup>th</sup> 
  May, LTTE men from the Kallady intelligence (but so-called &#145;political&#146;) 
  office came into the area on 4 motor cycles and 2 push bikes as though going 
  to the beach. Some women in the area recognized them, and, guessing their purpose, 
  screamed. Varatharajan and Thangarasa escaped through the back fence to the 
  Batticaloa EPRLF(V) office. Varatharajan now lives in the Chenkalady office 
  of the EPRLF(V).</p>
<p>Varatharajan&#146;s wife Sivapunniam Rathirani (37) continued living in Beach 
  Road, Kallady with her two children Kishuthan (10) and Tharaniyan (9). On 15th 
  July she went by bus to her husband&#146;s office in Chenkalady to collect his 
  salary for her household expenses. She left the Chenkalady EPRLF office for 
  the bus stand at 3:00 PM. The following morning Rathirani&#146;s mother came 
  looking for her and reported her missing. It was feared that she had been abducted 
  by the LTTE. Under the MoU the LTTE has an office in Chekalady for &#145;political 
  work&#146;. </p>
<p>At the bus stand Rathirani was accosted by members of the LTTE who came on 
  7 bicycles and a motorbike. They ordered Rathirani to get on to the pillion 
  of a bicycle. Being a tough woman, she argued back and refused. Meanwhile the 
  Batticaloa bus arrived and she ran into it. She went to the middle of the bus 
  and sat with some women. Some of the LTTE men followed her and dragged her off 
  the bus by her dress, while the others blocked the bus from both sides. </p>
<p>Once outside, another bus arrived. Rathirani ran and got into a second bus, 
  but she was again dragged out and forced onto a bicycle. She was taken to the 
  LTTE&#146;s Chenkalady &#145;political office&#146; that is under government 
  control and detained there until after nightfall. In order to avoid the Black 
  Bridge army check point, they then took her towards the sea, crossed the main 
  road again near Eastern University, then across the lagoon by an unguarded bridge 
  to a women&#146;s camp near the LTTE check point on Badulla Road. Up to this 
  time she had been beaten, but not badly.</p>
<p>The following day (16<sup>th </sup>July) she was taken further into the interior, 
  beaten and interrogated by LTTE women. They asked for details about her husband, 
  children, herself, and her connections in Pandirippu, Mandur and Kallady where 
  she had resided. </p>
<p>She was told:</p>
<ol start=1 type=1>
  <li>Her husband must leave the EPRLF(V)</li>
  <li>She must bring a photograph of her husband</li>
  <li>She must report to the LTTE camp in Karadian Aru and sign a register every 
    Monday</li>
  <li>She must follow their instructions and work for the LTTE. </li>
</ol>
<p>Should she fail to meet these conditions, she was told, they would come home 
  and kill her. She was advised to send her husband abroad.</p>
<p>On 18 July at 2:00 PM the LTTE put Rathirani in a Chenkalady bus. At Chenkalady 
  she collected her identity card and passport from the LTTE office and went home. 
  Earlier, persons who approached LTTE representative Kausalyan about the abduction 
  were not given an answer, whether they had her or not. </p>
<p><b>What are the SLMM Monitors doing?</b></p>
<p>The Monitors have claimed that their weapon is not the gun, but persuasion. 
  If that is so they have failed. They have not had any influence over 17 months 
  in bringing about a substantive change in the LTTE&#146;s behaviour through 
  their persuasion. The have failed to achieve even the appearance of impartiality. 
  When violations by the LTTE have been reported to the SLMM by other Tamil parties, 
  representatives have sometimes refused to go to the place of the incident altogether, 
  or delayed their visit for many hours. </p>
<p>We learn that when known members of the LTTE threw a grenade which exploded 
  after striking the boundary wall of EPRLF(V) Batticaloa leader Thurairatnam&#146;s 
  house early this year, it took the SLMM nearly a day, until the following evening, 
  to go the house about 200 yards from their office.</p>
<p>By comparison, when the LTTE complained to the SLMM of an unexploded grenade 
  thrown at their Batticaloa Arasady Road office, the SLMM, we understand, alerted 
  the Police and took them there. The others have been told that attacks on them 
  are Police and not SLMM matters.</p>
<p>On 2<sup>nd</sup> July, some members of the EPDP were distributing leaflets 
  near the Vavuniya bus stand. They were surrounded by a group of LTTE members 
  who tore up the leaflets, burnt them and assaulted the EPDP members. The EPDP 
  informed the SLMM, who said that they would come to the EPDP office, but not 
  to the place of the incident. The following day&#146;s Tamil daily, <i>Virakesari</i>, 
  carried an item by Sri Gajan headlined <i>&#145;Quarrel between the LTTE and 
  EPDP, People Burn EPDP Leaflets&#146;</i>. The report claimed that the &#145;people&#146; 
  destroyed the leaflets and beat up two EPDP members. At the end the report indicated, 
  as it were in the small print, that this is the LTTE&#146;s version. The SLMM, 
  the report said, spoke to both sides and solved the problem. </p>
<p>.The SLMM&#146;s biased and contradictory position of disowning their responsibility 
  for violations committed against non-LTTE groups and civilians by dubbing these 
  violations of the MoU as law and order matters meant for the Police to handle, 
  discredits their role.</p>
<p>After all they are very interested in being taken to the scene when the Navy 
  intercepts gunrunning by the LTTE &#150; no less a law and order issue.</p>
<p>No one expects the Monitors to use guns, but as the term indicates, one expects 
  them to be vigilant, to provide judgment of the true state of affairs, apply 
  pressure on violators and restore some sanity. What we are seeing instead is 
  the systematic suffocation of truth For instance, the impression is being created 
  that the problem of child conscription is under control. But the reality is 
  that in recent months people have been made very conscious of the LTTE&#146;s 
  apparatus of terror through a spate of political killings, and in areas where 
  significant child conscription is being reported, community leaders are afraid 
  even to hint at it.</p>
<p><b>No Peace Without Political Normalization</b></p>
<p>UNICEF&#146;s strategy for dealing with child conscription by the LTTE, by 
  treating it as a separate issue from democracy and political normalization, 
  is looking increasingly hollow. It would amount to a humbug that simply pours 
  money into the coffers of the TRO. We have reports that a significant number 
  of minors have recently been conscripted in the Valaichenai area. On the night 
  of 5<sup>th</sup> July, up to 25 conscripts were being driven in a tractor-trailer 
  to Vaharai, when some of them escaped. A number of other reports too have appeared 
  in the Press. One was of Ramupillai Subramaniam, father of 14-year-old Vijayanandini 
  from Mutur, who committed suicide after he failed to obtain the release of his 
  daughter who was abducted by the LTTE on 1<sup>st</sup> July. <a href="#top">[Top]</a></p>
