  beyond comprehension</a></span></span> <span
style='font-size:12.0pt'></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When ordinary folk in search of 
  a bare living are caught up in a vortex resulting from cross-winds of ideology, 
  their destiny is one they lack any control over. This has been the fate of the 
  Sinhalese settlers in the Padaviya-Weli Oya area, no less than that of the Tamils 
  forcibly evicted and rendered refugees. The author of `For a Sovereign State' 
  quotes from a speech attributed to D.S.Senanayake by his grandson: &quot;..The 
  final battle for the Sinhala people will be fought on the plains of Padaviya. 
  You ...will carry the Island's destiny on your shoulders. Those who are attempting 
  to divide this country will have to reckon with you... the last bastion of the 
  Sinhala&quot;.Whether D.S.Senanayake was ever in this state of mind, or had 
  actually viewed Padaviya in these terms is uncertain. But the quotation does 
  reflect the state of mind of the author and several of his associates from the 
  elite in political circles, the administration and the military, during the 
  mid-80s. This was when the communal violence of July 1983 triggered off a full-blown 
  separatist war. </p>
<p>The troubles of Padaviya began in 1956 when, like in Gal Oya, Sinhalese employees 
  on the scheme attacked Tamils. In the sequel the Tamil view of Padaviya became 
  coloured as that of a dark region on the boundary of the Northern and Eastern 
  Provinces forbidden to Tamils. This history made Padaviya a natural base for 
  extending military backed settlements into the North-East. This is what happened 
  from mid-1984. </p>
<p>By the end of the year 1984 the forces had forcibly evicted Tamils from 5 GS 
  Divisions in Mullaitivu District and Tennemaravady in Trincomalee District [see 
  UTHR(Jaffna) <a
href="..\SpecialReports\spreport5.htm">Special Report No. 5</a>; From Manal Aru 
  to Weli Oya : The sprit of July 1983].The first evictions were achieved through 
  harassment by newly settled convicts who were backed by the forces. The final 
  order was broadcast to the villages by the armed forces using loudspeakers on 
  Christmas Eve 1984. The people were given 24 hours to vacate. The first Sinhalese 
  settlers brought in were prisoners settled in the Open Prison Camp established 
  in the premises of Kent and Dollar farms. The first ever massacre of Sinhalese 
  by Tamil militants took place here on 30th November 1984. Both communities became 
  victims of massacres and counter massacres. Nearly 2700 Tamil families were 
  displaced. The attempt to solve their problem under terms of the Indo-Lanka 
  Accord which provided for the return of displaced persons was thwarted in September 
  1987 when the LTTE launched the Thileepan fast for reasons of its political 
  survival, leading to events which culminated in war with the IPKF. The LTTE 
  has never been serious about solving the problem of the displaced even during 
  the long talks with President Premadasa until June 1990. The festering sore 
  has rather been politically useful and a ready source of recruits. The story 
  of Sinhalese settlers trapped in an oppressive militaristic environment where 
  they are mere chattels has been no less tragic. The beneficiaries were neither 
  the Sinhalese nor the Tamil people. </p>
<p>M.H. Gunaratne's, `For a Sovereign State', though very frank and truthful where 
  his own feelings and those of his circle are concerned, the people whose cause 
  they ostensibly championed have become mere abstractions. In nearly all reporting 
  that followed, the feelings and expectations of the people have become subsumed 
  in a military discourse. They became virtual auxiliaries in military calculations. 
  The story of these Sinhalese who were victims of circumstances remained largely 
  untold. We will now attempt a sketch of their story from some of their own accounts. 
</p>
<p>H.N. Somadasa of Walapane, Udapusselawa, came to Padaviya at the age of 21 
  in 1956 as an irrigation employee. Following the communal violence which sparked 
  off that year, he was remanded. Asked what led him to join in attacks on Tamils, 
  he replied ,&quot;There were many Tamils employed on the scheme. A rumour was 
  spread that Tamils were going to takeover the entire scheme. We became angry 
  and attacked them. I later discovered that the rumour was false and felt ashamed&quot;. 
  Asked who spread the rumours, he replied &quot;Why, the papers had them!&quot; 
  . He, like the other employees of the scheme received land in Padaviya in lieu 
  of gratuity. The violence ensured the exclusion of Tamils from the scheme. The 
  few Tamils who remained were a dwindling lot. With reprisals sparked off by 
  the LTTE's Kent &amp; Dollar farms massacre of 1984, the small Tamil presence 
  came to an end. The Tamils who survived the last incident were protected by 
  their neighbours. </p>
<p>&nbsp;Jessie Nona, an orphan from Veyangoda, came to Padaviya in 1957 with 
  her brother who was given land. She later married and had children in Padaviya. 
  In 1984, her brother's son who was serving a term in Anuradhapura prison for 
  an illicit liquor offence was brought to the newly opened Open Prison Camp at 
  Kent&amp; Dollar farms in`Weli oya'. Since Jessie Nona's daughter had no land 
  in Padaviya, the mother accompanied the daughter to start a shop in the `Weli 
  Oya' settlement. She and her daughter survived the massacre of 30th November`84 
  and fled back to Parakramapura in Padaviya. Her nephew had been killed in the 
  massacre. </p>
<p>Jessie Nona's eldest son had died of snake -bite. Her younger son who joined 
  the army had come home in December last year (1994), upon hearing that his mother 
  was very ill, being bitten by a snake. At home he heard of a tragedy involving 
  his marital relationship. The heart broken soldier went away by himself in a 
  state of insanity. The mother, who has his little son, has not heard of him 
  since. </p>
<p>An activist in a leftwing political group said that he with others from the 
  group had gone to Kent &amp; Dollar farms just after the November `84 massacre. 
  The survivors had told them that the settlement of prisoners was being used 
  to further harass Tamils into leaving the area. They were told that young Tamil 
  women were abducted, brought there and gang-raped, first by the forces, next 
  by prison guards and finally by prisoners. </p>
<p>H.A. Dhanapala (55), originally from Balapitiya, was married and settled in 
  Ibbagamuwa near Kurnegala, where he worked as a road construction worker for 
  10 years.&nbsp; He became unemployed when the road Development Authority was 
  formed. He then used to go&nbsp; to Polonnaruwa District as a seasonal labourer 
  for paddy harvesting. There in 1984 he heard that Dimblagala Thero, who had 
  led the march to occupy Maduru Oya basin the previous year, was offering people 
  land north of Padaviya. Dhanapala went to the Pimburattawa school, was selected 
  by the Thero and was taken to the new settlement at Sinhapura, Weli Oya. </p>
<p>Life there was dangerous. Army positions were interspersed with civilian dwellings. 
  Nights were interrupted by firing noises.As time went by many of his neighbours 
  left, leaving their dwellings empty. </p>
<p>Dhanapala's only son is in the army. Of his three daughters, one is in Weli 
  Oya married to a soldier, one married in Parakramapura and the other has left 
  the area. Following the August `94 general elections, the army left its positions 
  among civilian dwellings and withdrew to the main camp. Asked why, Dhanapala 
  said that according to local talk this resulted from a complaint at high level 
  that soldiers were misbehaving with civilians, particularly the women. Asked 
  whether it had increased the danger to civilians, he replied that since that 
  time (August`94) there had seldom been firing noises in the night. &quot;Perhaps&quot;, 
  he added, &quot;the Tigers only regarded the soldiers as the enemy, and not 
  us civilians&quot;. But he could not be sure. Why then did he stay on under 
  these conditions? His reply was that he had nowhere else to go and make a living, 
  and he had no other means.<a href="#_Toc515538242">[Top]</a> </p>
<h2><a name="_Toc515538243">General perceptions in Weli Oya</a></h2>
<p>The movement for Peace with Democracy had organised a rally in Parakramapura 
  for the end of January, which a number of people from Weli Oya were to attend. 
  On hearing of this, the Brigadier in charge of the Weli Oya military district 
  warned the organisers that people from Weli Oya are not to carry slogans or 
  banners. If they do, he said , he would remand the local organisers. </p>
<p>After conferring in Padaviya, the local organisers told the Brigadier, &quot;These 
  slogans have been carried all over the South and this country is supposed to 
  be returning to democracy. There is no reason why this area is special and slogans 
  should not be carried here. We will face the consequences&quot;. Eventually 
  people from Weli Oya came in several tractors carrying slogans and no one was 
  remanded. The incident illustrates how the army views the people. Their life 
  is completely militarized. An old man put it, &quot; even to piss, we have to 
  get permission from the army&quot;. Children who go to school, it is said , 
  do not look at the black board, but look at the jungle for signs of danger- 
  as children in Jaffna used to look at the sky for bombers. This much is just 
  the surface. </p>
<p>There are many deeper complaints. The army positions are among the civilians. 
  Several of the men said, &quot; We do not know if the army is protecting us 
  or we are protecting the army&quot;. In the nights, they said, men among the 
  civilians are sent into bunkers with shotguns, while in their homes the women 
  are abused by soldiers. We also reliably learnt that the women are sometimes 
  forced to pose for pornographic pictures which are marketed within the army 
  by enterprising soldiers. Under such a regime discipline plummets and the army 

  itself tends to disintegrate. Civilians are forced to involve themselves in 
  theft among soldiers. If a solder on patrol fails to return, another soldier 
  may steal his money and belongings and deposit them with civilians until he 
  could take them away. An ironical remark is not infrequently heard: &quot;For 
  what these fellows do to us,only the Tigers could teach them a lesson&quot;. 
</p>
<p>Through their sons, relatives or neighbours, most of these people have close 
  connections within the army. Yet, like with many rural Tamils whose sons are 
  in the LTTE and other groups, their feelings are mixed with deep reservations. 
</p>
<p>The people are keenly aware that Tamils had lived there before them, who were 
  then driven away. They also feel that LTTE recruits who are in the area are 
  from among the Tamils who were driven away-&quot;They know the foot paths better 
  than us or the army&quot;. In justification of the settlement exercise, the 
  people had been told that the leasing out of large tracts of crown land in the 
  area by mostly absentee Tamils (in the 60s) marked a sinister development. The 
  people were however aware that the Tamil families driven out by the forces are 
  poor farmers. <a href="#_Toc515538242">[Top]</a></p>
<h2><a name="_Toc515538244">A fate beyond comprehension</a></h2>
<p>The peace meeting at Parakramapura, Padaviya, pulled in one of the largest 
  crowds. Many were women who walked in the afternoon sun carrying infants. The 
  people themselves talked as though they were caught up in a vicious trap of 
  poverty, militarisation and bereavement that was beyond their comprehension. 
  It was well for their peers in Colombo to romanticise the fate imposed on them 
  as of being the `last bastion of the Sinhala'. But the people were themselves 
  hopelessly tired and were looking for fresh hope. </p>
<p>Asked about the impact of the war, Somadasa said that every year about two 
  or three dead bodies of soldiers are brought for internment to his village of 
  Siyawa, Padviya. The village has about 200 families. Considering ten years of 
  war, the impact is quantitatively of the order of what an average Tamil village 
  in the East would have suffered. </p>
<p>Piyadasa (50), originally from Madawachiya, explained: &quot;Many young boys 
  from here have joined the forces because rains have failed for the last seven 
  years and the reservoir does not store enough water. Consequently the people 
  are unable to make ends meet through cultivation. During the rainy season (Yala, 
  October -December) our fields tend to flood. Cultivation at this time (rain 
  -fed cultivation) thus tends to be unreliable. Our main crop is therefore during 
  the summer(Maha) season. This depends on water from the reservoir&quot;. Farmers 
  questioned said they have cultivated about four times in the last three years.For 
  families without an income apart from cultivation, life is hard. </p>
<p>Gunawathie (40) originally from Madawachiya is unmarried. Her family derive 
  their main income from helping two brothers who cultivate the family plot of 
  3 acres. They manage because of support from the state(eg.dry rations) in the 
  event of crop failure. That also means state patronage. Padaviya's problems 
  may have partly to do with environmental stress resulting from deforestation 
  of the catchment area&nbsp; that accompanies large settlement schemes, as people 
  look for more land. But for the people who were transplanted and promised a 
  bright future, they have instead been caught up in a web of state patronage 
  and militarisation in which assorted groups of politicians, `patriots' and war 
  mongers try to cash in. To the people the past seems to have been better- a 
  past when Tamils lived among them. Yet, behind the pall of violence Weli Oya 
  or Manal Aru carries a Message of hope now 2500 years old, and almost forgotten. 
  An inscription by King Uttiya identifies Naval Neeravi Malei in the region as 
  being associated with Buddha's second visit to this country. At this spot he 
  had made peace between the two warring Naga chieftains Mahodara and Chulodara. 
  The legend probably refers to the fact that Buddhism was preached in this area 
  at a very early date close to the time of Buddha himself.The legend tells us 
  that the message of the Buddha brought peace between warring ancestors of people 
  presently inhabiting this island- ancestors perhaps of both Sinhalese and Tamils 
  alike. </p>
<p>`Weli Oya' has drawn considerable outpourings of emotion from people with little 
  direct interest in the area. If it is allowed to become a political foot-ball, 
  it could seriously threaten the prospects of peace. It primarily rests with 
  the government to take initiatives to defuse Weli Oya as a politically contentious 
  issue, by providing justice to both the Sinhalese civilians used as pawns in 
  a military game as well as to the Tamil civilians. In doing so the government 
  should make it clear that it has no hidden agenda to Sinhalise predominantly 
  Tamil areas through military and administrative sleights. By so doing it could&nbsp; 
  also demonstrate to the people &amp; the world at large that this government's 
  approach to solving the ethnic problem is&nbsp; qualitatively different from 
  the past attempts. To this end we strongly suggest the following: <br>
  &nbsp; </p>
<p><b>1. The Tamils who were displaced from the Manal Aru (Mahaveli system L) 
  area to be resettled in their native places with adequate compensation.</b></p>
<p><b>2. The Sinhalese who, out of reasons of poverty or some other social disability 
  (eg. convicts), were taken to Weli Oya under a misapprehension to lead a life 
  in which they were effectively human shields for the army, to be assisted with 
  alternative arrangements to start a new life.</b></p>
<p><b>Delay would mean that sooner, rather than later, the government would find 
  itself in a quagmire.<a href="#_Toc515538242">[Top]</a></b></p>
