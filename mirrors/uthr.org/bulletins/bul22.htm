<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>There had been several incidents of 
  murder in Colombo of late, of which three were suicide bomb attacks by the LTTE 
  which claimed several dozens of lives. On the eve of the presidential election, 
  at 9.25 P.M. on 18<sup>th</sup> December, <b>President Kumaratunge</b> narrowly 
  survived a suicide bomb attack. In a separate attack half an hour earlier, <b>Major 
  General Lucky Algama</b>, who was viewed as one who would play an important 
  role in the defence ministry in the event of a UNP victory, was killed. Although 
  initially the killing of <b>Algama</b> was alleged to be the work of the PA, 
  all subsequent evidence showed that it was a suicidal attack and so far no serious 
  evidence has been produced by the UNP opposition to counter this. These two 
  and the suicide attack opposite the Prime Minister&#146;s office on 5<sup>th</sup> 
  January stemmed from the same well-tested political strategy that the LTTE has 
  become master of. On the one hand, it will target any Tamil who rejects condemning 
  the whole community to the suicidal war, which the LTTE is fated to fight, and 
  works instead for a political solution. On the other hand, it will go on with 
  suicidal attacks in the South to kill Sinhalese leaders and to bring out the 
  bestial element in man. Far more than its military strategies, these two elements 
  make up the political thrust, which the LTTE is condemned to pursue. Not to 
  fall into the trap requires almost super human restraint, clear perception and 
  sound strategy. This holds not just for the Government, but also for civil society 
  and non-governmental groups in general. <u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>The night of 18<sup>th</sup> December 
  when <b>President Kumaratunge</b> was attacked gave us an idea of what could 
  have gone dangerously wrong. The fact that the President survived, and appealed 
  to the country through her secretary to keep calm, as she ought to have done, 
  helped to allay fears that there would be anarchy. These attacks were not by 
  a group representing the Tamil people and wanting a bona-fide settlement to 
  the problem. The LTTE believes that only anarchy in the South, a collapse of 
  order and renewed communal violence against the Tamils will serve its ends.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><b><span
lang=EN-GB>A phenomenon which has institutionalised the suicide cult and is able 
  to turn out an apparently inexhaustible supply of suicide bombers cannot be 
  approached lightly. It requires much greater sensitivity in dealing with the 
  ordinary Tamils.<u1:p></u1:p></span></b></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>But this is nowhere the priority today. 
  When peace groups talk about confidence building, they hardly refer to the Tamil 
  people, but rather to the LTTE. The President is on record saying that she would 
  discuss anything with the LTTE short of a separate state. Why then feel so timid 
  about conceding federalism which Tamil moderate opinion has demanded from the 
  1950s? Why such a laboured political package trying hard to give the impression 
  that it is something short of what the Tamil people want? Are not both the President 
  and the Leader of the Opposition giving the message that it is not the reasoned 
  voice of Tamil moderation that counts, but rather, intractable extremism and 
  suicide bombers? It is a needless complication of the problem.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>The suicide cult involves a leader 
  with such unbounded faith in himself and his cause, that he unflinchingly sends 
  a stream of young Tamils into the flames of self-immolation. He will stop at 
  nothing, and that needs to be understood. In this context, excluding the people 
  and thinking about &#145;confidence building&#146; between the LTTE and the 
  Government is an almost cynical proposition that is totally out of place.<u1:p></u1:p><a href="#_Toc515621630">[Top]</a></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The murder by a lone assassin with a gun of <b>Kumar 
  Ponnambalam</b>, leader of the All Ceylon Tamil Congress on 5<sup>th</sup> January 
  this year, has given rise to problems that did not arise with the murders of 
  <b>Neelan Thiruchchelvam</b>, <b>Sarojini Yogeswaran</b>, <b>A.Thangathurai</b> 
  and several other Tamil leaders, nor with the attempted murder of <b>President 
  Kumaratunge</b> and the murder of <b>General Algama</b>. <b>Kumar Ponnambalam</b> 
  had been a part of that social ferment within the Tamil elite that spawned and 
  sustained the politics of the LTTE. Its ultimate purpose - to unreasonably vilify, 
  provoke and bring out the worst in the Sinhalese. This is done by harping on 
  the very real suffering of the Tamils - often through the sheer callousness 
  of the State - but, refusing to acknowledge the instrumentality of the LTTE 
  in this or the role played by a segment in the Sinhalese polity which is also 
  challenging the status quo. This is then used to argue that nothing good will 
  come out of the Sinhalese. <u1:p></u1:p></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>To see <b>Kumar Ponnambalam</b> merely 
  as an individual is to miss the point. Seeing his political career as simply 
  opportunistic is also to miss the wood for the trees. If one goes into the past 
  of individuals uncompromisingly backing the LTTE, one would very likely find 
  elements which the LTTE in theory finds far from congenial - others have been 
  killed for much less. Among this group one finds a secretary to the ministry 
  of labour under the UNP as well as a vice president of <b>Gamini Dissanayake&#146;s</b> 
  trade union - the LJEWU, former central committee members of the EPRLF and a 
  public relations officer of the former North-East provincial administration. 
  <b>Kumar Ponnambalam</b> too ridiculed separatism when the TULF advocated it, 
  supported the Indo-Lanka Accord and pledged to bring in the Tamil groups to 
  implement it (Sunday Times 20.9.87) and asked <b>President Jayawardene</b> for 
  a place for his party in the proposed Interim Council, all of which the LTTE 
  leader wanted for his appointees (Sun 3.10.87). A year later he joined forces 
  with the SLFP and campaigned on an anti-Accord platform. At least one candidate 
  - <b>M.P.Sivagnanam</b> - on his party&#146;s list of candidates for tthe Jaffna 
  District in the February 1989 general elections was shot dead by the LTTE (on 
  25.1.89).<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><b><span
lang=EN-GB>Kumar Ponnambalam</span></b><span
lang=EN-GB> well understood the LTTE, which had given a clear message that he 
  should keep out of politics in Jaffna. Five years later, prior to the August 
  1994 general elections, in an address to the Rotary Club in Trincomalee he took 
  a frankly pro-LTTE separatist line and denounced the other Tamil parties as 
  traitors. This was the prelude to his contesting parliamentary elections from 
  Colombo in which he was unsuccessful. From this time, he was a vocal and insensitive 
  advocate of the LTTE. His advocacy was blind to Tamil history and offensive 
  to many Sinhalese and Tamils alike. <u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>There was also the endearing side 
  to him. He was affable and many a Tamil youth, who had gone through Sri Lanka&#146;s 
  prisons as a PTA detainee, had his case taken up by <b>Kumar Ponnambalam</b> 
  free of charge.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>Pushing an ultra-Tamil nationalist 
  line against his chequered background entailed a rhetorical approach that was 
  not mellowed by reason. Ironically, the same private media that gave him publicity 
  were also the same ones that promoted Sinhalese extremist opinions. A characteristic 
  which explains the latter, was that they could not make out the difference between 
  Neelan Thiruchelvam and <b>Kumar Ponnambalam</b>. The result was growing suffocation 
  in the political atmosphere with reasoned discussion becoming increasingly difficult. 
  With the LTTE&#146;s suicide bomb attacks thrown in, there was much potential 
  for things to spin out of control. <u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>To call the politics of those like 
  <b>Kumar Ponnambalam</b> sincere or insincere is misleading. Sincerity applies 
  where there is constancy and a commitment to human values. The politics of those 
  like KP is rather, obsessive, blind to history and rooted in the present. In 
  a sense it could be sincere in its blind obsessiveness and is not necessarily 
  cowardly. KP went on despite being warned of dangers and being asked by his 
  family and his friends to tone down. His friends in the media who encouraged 
  both Sinhalese and Tamil extremism egged him on and finally were themselves 
  in no position to control the fallout.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>The posthumous denunciation of <b>Neelan 
  Thiruchelvam</b> by members of the Tamil elite - including <b>Kumar Ponnambalam</b>, 
  <b>Nadesan Sathyendra</b>, <b>Wakeley Paul</b> and some men in holy orders - 
  signified an obsessive hatred that was closely akin to madness. The actors were 
  themselves fast losing control of their emotions, words and actions. It was 
  a state of mind heading towards breakdown, careless of dangers to themselves 
  and those around them. <u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>On the other hand, the popularity 
  KP built up among a significant section of Tamils in the South was because he 
  gave voice to the gut feelings of resentment harboured by many Tamils against 
  the State. This section does not represent all the Tamils who have grievances 
  against the State, but is a segment of a very divided community. In the absence 
  of freedom to discuss choices owing to internal terror, this community takes 
  a very diversified approach to both the State and the LTTE, often based on immediate 
  experience. If KP did not exist, the situation of the Tamils in the South would 
  have demanded one like him to articulate their gut feelings. <u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>We are indeed faced with a most perilous 
  situation when a large section of the community is driven by this psychology. 
  These are thoughts the people regularly encounter in the Tamil media and also 
  in what is passed on by word of mouth. It justifies and whitewashes the systematic 
  repression faced by people living under the LTTE. Among the Sinhalese, this 
  psychology exposes the Tamils to silent resentment. In the Hill Country this 
  ultra-nationalism is being fed to an alienated and discriminated population 

  by politicians who hope to translate resentment into votes, as politics in the 
  North-East did a generation ago. Expressions of hate such as &#145;traitor&#146; 
  and &#145;he deserves to be lamp-posted&#146; have long found their way into 
  common parlance in the Hill country. <u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>The fallout from this situation can 
  only be handled by sensitive understanding and timely reform. Is the country 
  equipped for this? In particular the law enforcement machinery should be seen 
  to be credible. The majority of the people who went to KP&#146;s funeral were 
  of the opinion that he had been murdered by a state agency and they were quite 
  a number who went. This feeling will persist unless the Government clears up 
  the matter. Moreover, such feeling among the people is not unjustified. On 7<sup>th</sup> 
  September 1999, journalist <b>Rohana Kumara</b> was killed His journalism was 
  of dubious quality and there are very influential persons who were once his 
  friends and later became his enemies. He had of late been exposing allegedly 
  corrupt activities of the President&#146;s Media Advisor. On 2<sup>nd</sup> 
  November, <b>Nadarajah Ramesh</b>, a parliamentarian belonging to the EPDP and 
  editor of a weekly that took a line similar to <b>Kumar Ponnambalam</b>&#146;s 
  was killed by a gunman wielding a T-56 or AK-47 rifle by broad day light in 
  the well-policed Wellawatte area. The Police investigation of these two murders 
  has been unconvincing. Despite <b>Ramesh</b> being a parliamentarian almost 
  nothing had been said on the matter after an initial pledge to investigate. 
  Under these conditions, the credibility of the State and the Police remains 

  low among the people.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>A particular problem that casts a shadow of suspicion 
  over the State concerns the murder of <b>Nadarajah</b> <b>Ramesh</b> mentioned 
  above. The location about Station Road, Wellawatte, is within a short distance 
  from where KP was killed. Although an MP, he lived a secretive life. Though 
  editing the <b>Thinamurasu</b>, a widely circulated paper promoting the LTTE, 
  he hardly saw any one. From his abode in Kirullapone, he used to drive to his 
  editorial office in Wellawatte. On the morning of 2<sup>nd</sup> November, he 
  was gunned down as he came along the beach road and turned. The attackers apparently 
  escaped on foot. This was within about a stone&#146;s throw from Wellawatte 
  Police Station. <u1:p></u1:p></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>The incident also suggests that the 
  killers had a base or safe-house in the area. If the Police had suspected LTTE 
  involvement and a safe-house where they were storing automatic rifles, they 
  would have lost no time in checking out the area house by house. No such checking 
  was done until after the events of late December. There has been a singular 
  lack of interest in the case. Thus people were quick to suspect state complicity. 
  If the State was involved, going from <b>Ramesh</b> to <b>Ponnambalam</b> was 
  only a matter of licence.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>Moreover, unlike KP, <b>Ramesh</b> 
  would not have been noticed by a Sinhalese extremist group. Of course he was 
  well-known in Tamil political circles, was a thorn-in-the-flesh within his own 
  group - the EPDP - and was a temporary - and only temporary - asset to the LTTE. 

  But, except for their politics and final location there are wide dissimilarities 
  between the murders of KP and <b>Ramesh</b>. <u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>Apart from these complications there 
  is an awkward problem for the Government: If the Police have drawn a blank on 
  <b>Ramesh</b>&#146;s murder, and follow it up with a blank on KP&#146;s murder, 
  it would become difficult for the Government to convince anyone that the State 
  was not involved in the murder of KP.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>If some agency of the State is orchestrating these 
  killings, it is a very dangerous development. It destroys all points of reference 
  between right and wrong and shows again that the State is unable to put behind 
  its past reliance on terror. Certain steps have been taken in the right direction 
  by making the security forces accountable in a few cases. Yet widespread torture 
  in police custody of arrested LTTE suspects, unsolved disappearances among 
  other abuses, are still continuing. Moreover, the first is common in Colombo. 
  This is why it is urgent for <b>Kumar Ponnambalam</b>&#146;s murder to be thoroughly 
  investigated and the culprits, who ever they are, brought to book. His murder 
  has created more space for someone else to carry forward his political creed 
  in a far more harmful manner.<u1:p></u1:p></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB>The State will have to prove its bona fides 
  by getting to the bottom of this. It cannot be difficult as it was done in broad 
  day light, by a killer who escaped and clues are bound to be forthcoming. But 
  the present investigation by the Police gives cause for concern. Beyond circulating 
  a drawing of the killer, questioning people and asking for information, little 
  progress has been made. <u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>While the IGP&#146;s determination 
  to find the perpetrators is welcome, the Police have so far not gone further 
  than saying that they have not found any evidence of a Sinhalese extremist group 
  being involved. The Tamils never took this possibility seriously. To them the 
  State is a key suspect and the Police seem to be going through a routine investigation 
  without taking this possibility into account. It still has not occurred to them 
  why people are reluctant to come forward with information. In comparison with 
  the massive rewards being offered for information on the Town Hall bombing, 
  the lackadaisical approach to the KP and <b>Ramesh</b> murders suggests that 
  the Police have ruled out the LTTE. <u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>The SSP, CDB, in charge of the case 
  is the same man who, when in the CID, bungled the <b>Joel Pera</b> murder case 
  of May 1997 where the Deputy Defence Minister&#146;s son was implicated. The 
  CID is known to be politicised and is yet to come up with any successes in well 
  known cases where the agents of crime are believed to be persons close to the 
  State:- eg: the <b>Rohana Kumara</b> case.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>We now move on to discuss how the 
  events above tie up with developments in the North-East, the whole making up 
  a powder keg.<u1:p></u1:p><a href="#_Toc515621630">[Top]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="_Toc515621633"><span lang=EN-GB>Prelude to the Presidential Election</span></a><span lang=EN-GB><u1:p></u1:p></span></h2>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>President Kumaratunge announced an 
  early presidential election in October 1999, stating that she was asking for 
  a mandate to pursue the stalled political package intended to resolve the ethnic 
  question. The reason for the failure was said to be the UNP opposition&#146;s 
  unwillingness to co-operate in the exercise. The election was one where the 
  minority vote was thought to be crucial. The UNP candidate <b>Ranil Wickremasinghe</b> 
  identified the problem as the Government&#146;s unwillingness to talk to the 
  LTTE and stated that he would start talks with the LTTE and in effect let the 
  LTTE run the North-East provincial council for two years as part of an interim 
  arrangement. He had no doubt been advised that this would get him Tamil votes. 
  It was also a proposal to resurrect the disastrous arrangement which <b>Premadasa</b> 
  made with the LTTE.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>From the experience of the PA Government&#146;s 
  talks with the LTTE in 1995, it was clear that the LTTE had no intention of 
  discussing a political solution. But the arrangement with <b>Premadasa </b>had 
  given the LTTE untrammelled power in the North-East without having to commit 
  itself to a political arrangement within a united Sri Lanka. The LTTE did everything 
  possible to help the election of <b>Ranil Wickremasinghe</b> whose position 
  was predicated on the belief that the Tamils were behind the LTTE - a line generally 
  put forward by NGO and peace lobbies. Given the LTTE&#146;s position on the 
  election, among Tamils in particular, the election became less a contest between 
  Kumaratunge and Wickremasinghe and became rather a referendum on whether the 
  Tamils wanted the LTTE to run their lives or not. The LTTE took no chances.

<h2><a name="_Toc515621634"><span lang=EN-GB>Setback in the Vanni and the tragedy 
  at Madhu</span></a><a name="_Toc515621634"><span lang=EN-GB><u1:p></u1:p></span></a><span lang=EN-GB></span></h2>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>In early November the LTTE launched 
  an attack on Oddusuddan Army camp in the Vanni and caused the Army to fall back 
  nearly 13 miles to about 10 miles north of Vavuniya. The disarray in which the 
  Army fell back in East Vanni encouraged the LTTE to repeat the same thing in 
  West Vanni, partly in the hope of sealing the PA&#146;s defeat at the presidential 
  election. The Army abandoned its position 8 miles north of Madhu and fell back 
  south of the prestigious Roman Catholic shrine at Madhu, which also functioned 
  as a UNHCR refugee camp. On 20<sup>th</sup> November the Army made a bid to 
  take back some of the territory which it had abandoned and in a northward advance 
  reached the Madhu shrine at 8.00 PM with the intention of continuing its advance. 
  About 300 soldiers were in the shrine premises and at about 10.00 PM, five or 
  so artillery shells fell in the shrine premises killing three dozens of refugees 
  who had taken shelter in a chapel. It was the Army who had earlier sent the 
  civilian refugees from the fighting in the surrounding areas, into the buildings. 
  The Army arrived not long afterwards and took the injured to Vavuniya hospital. 
  But the controversy remained as to who had fired the shells. <u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>Several of the civilians thought that 
  the Army had fired the shells because it had asked them to go into the buildings. 
  The LTTE from its London office was quick to accuse the Army of having fired 
  &#145;an artillery barrage&#146;. But it also accused the Army of using the 
  civilians as a shield, testifying that the shells were indeed artillery shells 
  and the soldiers were close to the civilians. This has been generally accepted. 
  In the statement issued by <b>Joseph Rayappu</b>, Bishop of Mannar, and <b>Malcolm 
  Ranjith</b> of the Bishop&#146;s Conference, there was no suggestion that the 
  Army had fired the shells. But they confirmed that the Army was in the premises, 
  seeming to imply that this was the reason why the shells were fired.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>A letter appeared in the Press that following the entry 
  of the Army into the Madhu area about 8.00 PM, the Bishop of Mannar had received 
  three telephone messages from the LTTE asking him to have the Army removed from 
  the shrine premises. The report went on to say that the Bishop had tried to 
  contact the political leaders in Colombo and had failed to get through. The 
  shells were fired at about 10.00 PM, less than two hours after the Army&#146;s 
  entry. It was also stated that the Bishop and church officials had no doubt 
  that the LTTE had fired the shells. The report has not been contradicted by 
  the Church. The Church has however not made any clear statement on the matter 
  and a senior church official when questioned on BBC Tamil Service on 21<sup>st</sup> 
  November, stated that the people believed that the Army fired the shells but 
  added that the LTTE could also have done it. When pressed further, he said that 
  he was not an eyewitness to the firing of shells and closed the interview after 
  saying that he would not like to give an opinion. <u1:p></u1:p></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>A conclusive investigation is yet to be done. It may 
  also be noted that there is nothing new in the LTTE firing shells into civilian 
  areas. Before the incident at Madhu, three civilians were killed when the LTTE 
  fired shells into a northern suburb of Vavuniya town. In addition, in late November 
  a shell fired by the LTTE fell near Mannar town. During December, civilians 
  were killed as the result of the LTTE firing shells into the Jaffna peninsula.

<h2><a name="_Toc515621635"><span lang=EN-GB>The Attack on Thallady</span></a><a name="_Toc515621635"><span lang=EN-GB><u1:p></u1:p></span></a><span lang=EN-GB></span></h2>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>Encouraged by its success in the area 
  held by the Vavuniya command, on 22<sup>nd</sup> November the LTTE made a determined 
  effort to push the Army out of the western sector under the command of the Mannar 
  brigade. According to civilian sources, several LTTE leaders including Sea Tiger 
  leader Soosai, had been in the area to oversee the attack. However, this time 
  the army command at Mannar under <b>Brigadier Kulatunge</b> was steady in its 
  reaction and the attack was foiled. Throughout the crisis, the Brigadier kept 
  in touch with the civil authorities and told the people not to panic. A special 
  arrangement was made to allow bus passengers from Colombo to come to Mannar 
  on the first day, rather than turn them back as normally happens. Although there 
  was initial panic about food shortages, within two or three days food supplies 
  were brought to the MPCS from Madawachchiya. In the Thallady defences, the Army 
  withdrew from only one outlying position to Chethukulam, which is also part 
  of the Thallady defences, and held on despite heavy pressure. <b>Major I.P.K.K.Baduge</b> 
  who led the defence died in action on 23<sup>rd</sup> November. The LTTE withdrew 
  after loosing 8 senior leaders and injuries being sustained by the Vanni leader 
  <b>Lakshman</b>. <u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>It was evident to the civilians that 
  while troops under the Vavuniya command were notably demoralised, those under 
  the Mannar command were steady. A large number of soldiers under the Vavuniya 
  command in the Mannar sector, in the course of their withdrawal southwards, 
  arrived at Adamban. They were so dejected it appeared to the villagers that 
  they could hardly lift their guns. Later they arrived at the army controlled 
  line at Uyilankulam, which was manned by the STF. The STF scolded them and asked 
  them to go back, stay in Adamban and fight. They dejectedly went back to Adamban, 
  stayed there for two days and came back to Uyilankulam. It would seem that there 
  was considerable confusion among officers and men in the Vavuniya command about 
  their task. However, a week later, those in the Vavuniya command seemed to have 
  recovered. Civilians travelling along the Mannar-Vavuniya road found the soldiers 
  behaving normally and ambush parties were also going out to check LTTE movement.

<h2><a name="_Toc515621636"><span lang=EN-GB>The LTTE Takes on Jaffna</span></a><u1:p></u1:p></h2>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>Fighting with less than 10,000 cadre, 
  against an army more than ten times its size, with many of them very young, 
  and women making up about a third of the casualties, the LTTE did not have the 
  capacity to hold territory against a determined army advance. It could not repeat 
  its successes in pushing back the Army once the Army had regained some sort 
  of equilibrium. But in attacking Elephant Pass at the entrance to Jaffna, the 
  LTTE seemed to feel a compulsion to go on irrespective of the casualties. One 
  could identify two distinct sources of pressure on the LTTE. In its overseas 
  propaganda which is oriented towards fund raising and keeping the faithful happy, 
  expectations had been raised of Eelam coming into being very soon, even with 
  the dawning of the year 2000. The other factor was that the drift of voting 
  tendency in Jaffna was very much towards the PA. Such an outcome was bound to 
  challenge the LTTE&#146;s claim to exclusive rights over the Tamils, so they 
  somehow had to apply pressure on the Jaffna voters. Also since the UNP candidate 
  had taken up the position that in the event of his being elected the LTTE could 
  run the North-East for two years, if the LTTE had made military inroads into 
  Jaffna, they could claim to have pushed the Army out as the Army withdrew in 
  the event of a UNP victory. <u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>Civilians in Jaffna too noticed that 
  army morale was not high and many of the men were hoping for a UNP victory so 
  that they could go home. From the 11<sup>th</sup> of December the LTTE started 
  shelling Thenmaratchy and the coastal areas of Jaffna town and asked the civilians 
  to move out of these areas. This calculated displacement was the same thing 
  that they had done in Vavuniya and Mannar districts during the previous months. 
  The effect of this was calculated to induce a sense of resignation among the 
  citizenry and the voters.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>But, Elephant Pass held out even though 
  the Army had to withdraw from certain positions. The LTTE attacked repeatedly, 
  although the element of surprise had been lost. The LTTE causalities from this 
  attack are believed to number more than 500. According to the Government, the 
  Army lost about 150 men. Artillery was used by both sides. Those with FM radio 
  sets listening to the LTTE&#146;s communications, heard a group of cadre in 
  the front telling their commanders that advance was difficult. But they were 
  urged to go on. The LTTE was prepared to pay a high price. Even after the elections 
  were held, the LTTE felt the compulsion to go on attacking Elephant Pass. <u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>Another reason for this was the grand 
  observance for the dawning of the year 2000 in the Vanni. A 47-foot cut-out 
  of the LTTE leader had been erected at Mallavi. Beside it were two huge maps. 
  One showed in colour the part of Sri Lanka that was Tamil Eelam. Another map 
  of Vanni showed the LTTE&#146;s territorial gains in recent weeks. It was a 
  three-day celebration to convince the people that Eelam was coming soon and 
  to draw in new recruits<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>On 18<sup>th</sup> December 1999, 
  on the last day of the election campaign, an LTTE suicide bomber narrowly missed 
  killing <b>President Chandrika Kumaratunge</b> and another bomber killed the 
  UNP&#146;s prospective defence minister, General Algama. The election was held 
  as scheduled on the 21<sup>st</sup> December. The Presidential election was 
  won by <b>Chandrika Kumaratunge</b>.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>There was a sequel to the shelling 
  of Madhu, where the LTTE killed the wrong man who had no political involvement. 
  <b>Anton Mariadas</b> of Vavuniya was a free-lance journalist who was frequently 
  used by the Roman Catholic Church to produce their programmes. Vanampadi is 
  a radio station of the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation (SLBC) broadcasting 
  from Vavuniya for residents in the North. Its news content generally questioned 
  the dominant LTTE politics and is also a propaganda channel of the State. But 
  it also played a role in enhancing access to religious and cultural programmes 
  in the North. The Roman Catholic Church took this facility to broadcast its 
  programmes. A particular programme planned was to broadcast the New Year mid-night 
  service from the church in Vavuniya. One producer was a journalist from SLBC, 
  based in Colombo, who was to work with <b>Anton Mariadas</b> in Vavuniya to 
  broadcast the mid-night service. The journalist from Colombo had earlier been 
  critical of the Catholic Church in the North. He had commented on a programme 
  that the church leaders were quick to condemn the shelling of Madhu, pretending 
  that it was done by the Army, but had been very silent over the shelling of 
  predominantly Roman Catholic areas in Jaffna town. It so happened that on New 
  Year&#146;s eve both <b>Mariadas</b> and the journalist from Colombo went to 
  church separately wearing shirt and tie, but <b>Mariadas</b> got there first. 
  When he came out the of church on some business, certain intruders marched him 
  100 yards away from the church and shot him dead. Later, a small boy came and 
  shouted from a church window that the person who came from Colombo had been 
  killed and ran away. Here is an example of how ordinary people suffer, when 
  church leaders who ought to be playing a leading role, maintain a methodical 
  silence. <u1:p></u1:p><a href="#_Toc515621630">[Top]</a></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>The shelling of coastal areas of Jaffna 
  has continued from mid-December. Many of the people affected are fisherfolk 
  who are Christians. More than 3 and up to 15 civilians have been killed and 
  others live in terror. The actual casualties have not been publicised because 
  it is the LTTE. Some shells have fallen in interior areas such as Chavakacheri 
  and Nallur. The Tamil media who never miss a chance to wax indignant against 
  the Army have merely reported shells falling from the air without any indication 
  of who fired them. IBC, an overseas Tamil radio based in London has described 
  the shelling by the LTTE as liberating the people from the Army. But in reality 
  civilians vacate one Army controlled area because of the shelling and move into 
  another Army controlled area!<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>Christmas too was celebrated under 
  these conditions and the Church has been largely silent. In early 1995 both 
  the Roman Catholic Bishops of Jaffna and Mannar backed the LTTE&#146;s position 
  that the Government should satisfy &#145;the day-to-day needs of the people&#146;,

<h1><a name="_Toc515621638"><span lang=EN-GB>Vanni - The Tortured People<u1:p></u1:p></span></a><span lang=EN-GB></span></h1>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>Those who went to the Vanni from Jaffna 
  during the 1995 exodus have largely left. The Vanni which comprises four electorates 
  has now only a fraction of its population living under LTTE control. The number 
  now living under LTTE control though often quoted as 400,000 is probably no 
  more than 200,000. This would be more realistic considering that the actual 
  population of Jaffna today is about 40% lower than the 1981 population. The 
  rest from the Vanni are scattered over Colombo, South India and the rest of 
  the world. Along with this, if one allows 100,000 for the interior areas of 
  the Batticaloa District, the LTTE&#146;s recruiting base is from a civilian 
  population of about 300,000. This population is called upon to sustain an LTTE 
  fighting force of 7000 to 10,000. By comparison, the 100,000 strong Sri Lankan 
  Army is sustained by a population of more than 12 million. The population sustaining 
  the LTTE&#146;s fighting capacity is either trapped in the Vanni or is living 
  in very deprived social surroundings in the East with no escape. In the Vanni 
  every aspect of their life is managed by the LTTE. Illness and poverty are compounded 
  by land-mine injuries resulting from minefields left behind with shifting defence 
  lines. According to authoritative sources 1500 persons have been fitted with 
  artificial limbs and there is a long waiting list. This would mean that in every 
  village of 200 families there are about 10 persons who have lost one or both 
  legs. The whole thrust of the LTTE&#146;s dealings with the people is to do 
  with recruitment. <u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>In recent times, much of the recruitment has been made 
  part of the system. According to figures given by the LTTE 10,000 of its cadre 
  have been killed in the last five years. This means that the LTTE needs 2000 
  recruits a year to maintain its numbers. This is probably higher in recent times 
  in view of the spate of conventional attacks. It means that it must recruit 
  a number amounting to 30% or more of those coming of age annually in schools. 
  Normally this kind of recruitment will fast destroy the community, and would 
  lead to a high degree of resistance. We give below a testimony which gives us 
  some idea of how the pressure is applied. <u1:p></u1:p></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>These basic statistics give, if anything, 
  a picture of the frighteningly tyrannical conditions under which these people 
  live. It is from such a society that the LTTE is able to find people who willingly 
  blow themselves up as suicide bombers.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>In recent months, recruitment has been more or less 
  regularised. In schools, the older children undergo compulsory physical training 
  three days a week. They are later made to march with poles and from here onwards 
  they move to carrying guns. Families on low income are entitled receive government 
  rations. The Tigers allow them to collect these rations only if one member of 
  the family performs some service for the Tigers, such as digging bunkers. From 
  here onwards recruitment becomes a process of filtration. The conditions can 
  be tightened or loosened depending on opposition and the needs of the Tigers. 
  <u1:p></u1:p></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>A good deal of what happens over recruitment is ad 
  hoc. Recently the LTTE was applying much pressure on children in a particular 
  area of Mullaitivu District to join them. A father from the area who is a farmer 

  applied for a pass to take his son to Vavuniya. The boy was about 15 years of 
  age. The LTTE told him if his son is to leave rather than join them, he must 
  pay Rs.50,000 for the pass and serve in the border force. The father paid the 
  money, took his family to Vavuniya and is now an LTTE auxiliary doing sentry 
  duty. <u1:p><span lang=EN-GB><u1:p></u1:p><a href="#_Toc515621630">[Top]</a></span></u1:p></p>
<h2><a name="_Toc515621639"><span lang=EN-GB>Recruitment in the Vanni - an Experience</span></a><a name="_Toc515621639"><span lang=EN-GB><u1:p></u1:p></span></a><span lang=EN-GB></span></h2>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>The experience given below tells us 
  a good deal about the strategies and even a measure of pseudo-legality governing 
  the recruitment of school children in the Vanni. The experience shows that everyone 
  involved - both the recruiters and the recruited - are trapped into the war 
  machine in diffferent ways. It has become a part of life that has been progressively 
  systematised. <u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>We will call her name <b>Kala</b>. 
  She was 16 years old and studying in a village school in the Mullaitivu District. 
  She was the third in a family of six. Recruitment had further intensified from 
  the time the government forces started their northward advance in mid-1997. 
  Those studying in school were accosted everywhere, while going and coming from 
  school or tuition classes and were told that all boys and girls must join the 
  movement. It was then that they would get Tamil Eelam soon, they were told. 
  Then they were asked, &#147;Are you going to leave this fight to the next generation?&#148; 
  The children were asked further, &#147;What sacrifices have you made for Tamil 
  Eelam?&#148; They remained silent and tried to avoid the recruiters. <u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>One day the recruiters came to school 
  and told the Principal that they must stop everything as they are going to conduct 
  a propaganda class. The teachers told the children, &#147;The Tigers are telling 
  us that we have done nothing for the cause of Tamil Eelam and there is some 
  point in what they say&#148;. They then advised the children, &#147;You listen 
  to their propaganda, but don&#146;t join them&#148;. The Principal and teachers 
  quietly stopped the classes for the younger children and sent messages to the 
  parents to carefully take their children away. <u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>Following the LTTE&#146;s capture 
  of Kilinochchi the recruiters came to school and insisted that the children 
  should join to replace the 400 cadre they had lost in the operation. There were 
  altogether three divisions in the O/Level class with a total of 100 students. 
  Out of this there were 20 students, including <b>Kala</b>, in whose families 
  none was either a martyr or a member of the LTTE. (A martyr is one who had died 
  fighting for the LTTE.)<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>A recruiter asked this group, &#147;What 
  are you doing for our cause? Of course, you are giving us some help but you 
  don&#146;t know it. The Government is sending you food relief. We too eat from 
  that without your knowing it. Apart from this are you giving us any help with 
  your bodies or in any other form?&#148; The militant families were addressed 
  separately. They were asked, &#147;What if your brothers and sisters have fought 
  or died for our cause? Are you trying to enjoy life on the basis of their sacrifice? 
  Everyone must have a feeling for our nation. Any number of people from a family 
  can join our movement.&#148;</span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>Those from <b>Kala&#146;s</b> group 
  were called one by one, asked for details about their home and were told that 
  in this pressing situation they must join and fight. They were asked, &#147;Don&#146;t 
  you have a conscience or feelings?&#148; Usually three or four people came for 
  propaganda classes. They were in the age group of 25-30. They were chosen for 
  eloquence or had reached a point where they were injured or for some reason 
  exempted from fighting. <b>Kala&#146;s</b> group remained silent. Those from 
  militant families were first allowed to go home. <b>Kala</b> and her group were 
  allowed to go home later. They were walking as a group, when LTTE members with 
  a vehicle came and stopped them. The girls were told, &#147;We have lost 400 
  of our comrades in the battle for Kilinochchi and we are somehow going to replace 
  them. If not, the Sri Lankan Army would retake Kilinochchi and their sacrifice 
  will be wasted. Come and join us, not because of the 15,000 who had been martyred 
  earlier, but because of the 400 who died at Kilinochchi.&#148;</span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>The girls were then pressed to get 
  into the vehicle. Several of the girls broke the cordon and ran away. Eleven 
  of the girls stood silently without attempting to run. <b>Kala</b> was pressed 
  into the van. She later recalled, &#147;When I was in the van, the other girls 
  cried in agony asking me to break out and escape. My heart burst in pain at 
  seeing their anxiety on my behalf. The poor girls did not know that they too 
  would be forced into the van.&#148; All the eleven girls were forced into the 
  van and driven to a base in an unknown place. There their names, addresses and 
  other details were recorded. There were about 1000 girls there, who had either 
  come there earlier or had been brought like <b>Kala&#146;s</b> group. <u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>They were told that the details are 
  being sent to the higher authorities and that they would be sent for training 
  only after the approval comes. <b>Kala</b> was there for two days. All the eleven 
  who were brought in <b>Kala&#146;</b>s lot somehow wanted to go home. <b>Kala</b> 
  and eight others were placed in one group and Kala was made the deputy leader 
  of the group. The two remaining girls were placed among another group<b>. Kala</b> 
  was told that if the leader gets authorisation to go for training, then she 
  would become leader. On the second day, four from the group dropped out and 
  only seven wanted to go home. <b>Kala</b> approached some girls on sentry duty 
  who were from her school and told them of their wish to go home. The girls on 
  sentry duty told her that they would let them go and take the punishment saying 
  that they were asleep when the others escaped. The seven girls left the camp 
  at 7.00 PM. At one point they heard an alarm and thought that there was a search 
  out for them. Getting advice from a cadre whom they met on the way, they walked 
  through the jungle and finally came to some buildings.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>They thought it was the camp from 
  which they escaped and made up their minds to surrender. But upon a closer look 
  they found that those were houses of a village. They knocked on the first door 
  but no one responded. They then knocked on the door of the second house. The 
  inmates woke up and welcomed them in and served them hot tea. The girls were 
  told it was a good thing that they did not wake up the person in the first house, 
  as he would have sent word to the LTTE. The girls were in no state to move out 
  since <b>Kala</b> was in her school uniform and the other girls had surrendered 
  their ear studs at the camp. They would have given themselves away as escapees. 
  The girls received directions from the people of the house, resumed their journey 
  in the night, and eventually contacted their homes. <u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>The propaganda wing man in <b>Kala&#146;s</b> 
  area was known to be hard man and threatened to somehow catch <b>Kala</b> again. 
  Her parents sent her to a neighbouring village. She came back home and sat for 
  her O/Levels after the propaganda wing man was transferred out. The students 
  in the O/Level class had been avoiding the recruiters saying that they are studying 
  hard for the O/Level and it would be a waste to join now without sitting for 
  the O/Levels. On the day the O/Level exam was over the school was surrounded 
  by the LTTE propaganda wing. They importuned the students to join. They were 
  told, &#147;One day you will have to die. If you die fighting, it will be a 
  hero&#146;s death, but if you die a natural death, it will be a coward&#146;s 
  death. Your parents may today discourage you from joining. But later they would 
  be ashamed of you.&#148;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>Another man from the propaganda wing 
  told them, &#147;When I joined the movement, several of my friends refused to 
  join. One day after the Army came to Kilinochchi they went to pluck coconuts 
  from their garden. A shell burst near them and all of them died. But I&#146;m 
  still alive. If I had not joined I would have died with them.&#148;</span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>In the course of the propaganda session, 
  they were told that their studies would not suffer if they joined the movement. 
  Even those who sold gram (kadalai) and joined the movement are now receiving 
  education inside the movement. They were told that their leader is extremely 
  concerned about their education. <b>Featuring very much in the propaganda sessions 
  were reported human rights violations by the Army in Jaffna. They were told 
  how the women of Jaffna are being raped and many disappeared after the Army 
  take-over</b>.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Kala kept getting mixed signals. Once she was told 
  by someone that she need not have escaped from the camp, because the Leader 
  had withheld approval for her to undergo training. The Leader, it is said, had 
  given instructions that only those above 18 should be sent for training and 
  the others should be sent home. There was another rumour that all those who 
  left camp without permission will be captured and sent back. <b>Kala&#146;s</b> 
  parents decided to get her out of the Vanni.<u1:p></u1:p></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>Coming from her testimony are several 
  elements of pseudo-legality observed by the group. The recruiters maintain that 
  the leader had ordered them to ask people only three times and that if they 
  did not join, they would later realise their mistake and join. But the recruiters 
  also insist, that they would ask them any number of times and it is their decision 
  and not the Leader&#146;s. It is also notable that enormous pressure is applied 
  on the youth but conscription in this instance was short of being wholly physical. 
  Those who ran home were allowed to go and only those who did not run were forced 
  into the van. On another occasion in the same school, the recruiters stopped 
  the school session and started their propaganda class. Four boys volunteered 
  to join and asked to be taken to camp. On the way these boys asked the LTTE 
  men to stop their motor bikes and told the recruiters that they had pretended 
  to volunteer only because they had disrupted the school session and got down 
  and went home.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>When the girls were taken to the camp too they were 
  assessed and treated differently. Some girls said that they feel for their families, 
  but they will have forget all about it and be militants. But several girls started 
  thinking about their families and were crying inconsolably. These girls were 
  separated and kept away from the others. The claim made to the girls that their 
  training must await permission from their Leader was a means of keeping options 
  open. It appears that the LTTE was not very serious about capturing the girls 
  who escaped. And in the event of their escape the LTTE was able to maintain 
  that the Leader had rejected them. <u1:p></u1:p></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><b><span
lang=EN-GB>Kala</span></b> herself to some extent believes that the Leader upholds 
  certain rules for recruitment. She cited an example of a fifteen-year-old who 
  had left a letter for his parents, run away and joined the LTTE. He, it is said, 
  was sent back because he was under age. But there had been cases of young cadre 
  in the thirteen to fifteen age group who had surrendered to the Army - e.g. 
  at Mankulam in October 1998. In the latter instance, the thirteen-year-old was 
  used to carry food to those who were fighting. The LTTE has developed greater 
  sophistication in its recruitment and the people in the closed environment in 
  the Vanni are very vulnerable. Some elements in the LTTE&#146;s propaganda are 
  very powerful and capture a reality which many of the people find readily plausible. 
  Here is an example: <u1:p></u1:p></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>&#147;The Sri Lankan Army and Government 
  are carrying on a determined campaign to wipe out the Tamil race. In their sight, 
  Tamils are Tigers and Tigers are Tamils. They do not make a distinction between 
  the two. You are going in your school uniforms, a Kfir bomber is coming on a 
  mission. If you think that the Air Force will not bomb you because you are students, 
  then you are mistaken. The bombs and shells make no distinction between civilians 
  and militants. They only know that whoever the victims, they will be Tamils. 
  You will of course recall the massacre by bombing at <b>Suthanthirapuram</b> 
  in the Vanni and the students killed at Nagar Kovil in Point Pedro. You have 
  a choice. You can die in vain and after the 31<sup>st</sup> day observance, 
  you will be forgotten. But you can instead join us and attain martyrdom. Your 
  sacrifice and courage will then be remembered in the annals of the nation.&#148;</span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The case of another woman in the propaganda wing gives 
  an idea of how the people are trapped in a hopeless environment. Even if they 
  want to leave, there was nowhere to go. She said, &#147;I and my younger sister 
  joined the movement. I am now not in a state to fight. The Leader of the Nation 
  gave me a letter asking me to go home. But I have no mind to go home. I long 
  to see the birth of Tamil Eelam while I am still a militant. After all, the 
  militants who become Black Tigers turn themselves into torches and die the death 
  of the brave. Following their example their brother or sister would come and 
  join us to fight for the cause. Why do they do this? Is it not to win Tamil 
  Eelam so that our generation can live in happiness and freedom? When they perform 
  such sacrifices, can any sacrifice by you be too much?&#148; <u1:p></u1:p></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>We may also note that in the particular school considered, 
  about 80% of the children had someone in the LTTE. This percentage will progressively 
  become higher. It is still remarkable that young LTTE cadre are willing to assist 
  friends who want to escape from the organisation and also that people are willing 
  to shelter runaways from the organisation. It shows that despite the LTTE having 
  made deep inroads into the society, qualities of human decency still remain 
  unimpaired and it should be the task of peace groups to give these qualities 
  a fuller reign. It would be wrong and counter to their interests to go about 
  making the superficial claim that the people are with the LTTE. The position 
  taken by the teachers explains the dilemma in which the Government has placed 
  them. They had doubts about the LTTE and quietly sent the younger children home. 
  They told the others, &#147;They have a point. Listen to them, but don&#146;t 
  join&#148;.<span lang=EN-GB><u1:p></u1:p><a href="#_Toc515621630">[Top]</a></span>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The last month witnessed three suicide bomb attacks 
  in Colombo, which rocked the city. All three were believed to have come from 
  the Eastern Province. The young woman who made an attempt on the President&#146;s 
  life was first thought to have come from Thalankudah, which is about 5 miles 
  south of Batticaloa. The man who killed <b>General Algama </b>is said to have 
  come from Trincomalee. The woman who blew herself up opposite the Prime minister&#146;s 
  office on 5<sup>th</sup> January had an identity card from Kolavil. What these 
  areas have experienced from the state forces since 1985 tells a harrowing tale 
  and little has been done to qualitatively change the situation. It is still 
  the case that if a civilian is killed, the body is taken to the mortuary, the 
  Police record the version of the security forces and generally that is the end 
  of the matter. This is one of the areas which we mentioned where little has 
  been done by activist groups in the South to improve the conditions of the people. 
  <u1:p></u1:p></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>Now the girl initially thought to 
  have come from Kolavil was stopped for questioning by the Police and was seen 
  crying for some time before she blew herself up. Why did she cry? Those tears 
  have a good deal to tell not only about the State but also about the Tamil people 
  who support the LTTE.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Kolavil is a suburb of Akkaraipattu in the Amparai 
  District. Both poverty and state oppression are keenly felt. In 1990 June the 
  security forces entered Akkaraipattu under a Colonel who is now Major General. 
  His actions in Kalmunai had resulted in hundreds of disappearances. Shortly 
  after he entered Akkaraipattu, about 50 persons went missing. For months the 
  families did not know what had happened to them. They lived in hope believing 
  a rumour that those detained were held at Kondavettuvan army camp. But to this 
  day they are missing. The STF then took over. The routine of torture, beating 
  and disappearance continued. The following are experiences from Akkaraipattu 
  (Our <a
href="../Reports/Report11/Report11.htm">Report No.11</a>): <u1:p></u1:p></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>Sellapah Rasaputhiran (20) of Akkaraipattu 
  7 was the eldest of eight brothers. Since his father had died, he left school 
  after grade five and worked as an assistant to a mason to support the family. 
  He was arrested by the STF on the 24<sup>th</sup> November 1990 during a cordon 
  and search operation with help from Muslim home guards. He was tortured for 
  two months in Akkaraipattu, pricked in his genitals and fingers, administered 
  phalanga and iron nails were driven into his hand nails and the nails were pulled 
  out. His wrist was broken. He was hung upside-down and beaten with an iron rod 
  and a piece of timber. Several of his companions disappeared. He was released 
  in November 1992 and is disabled. <u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><b><span
lang=EN-GB>Rasalatchumi</span></b><span
lang=EN-GB> of Kolavil (Akkaraipattu 3) had a number of children of whom one had 
  joined the LTTE. She did not know whether he was alive or dead. Sometime later 
  the STF heard about it, paid frequent visits to her house and harassed her and 
  her children. One day in 1992 they dismantled her well-sweep and took it away, 
  preventing her from drawing water. She was forced to leave the area.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Cases of this kind have continued ever since. Life 
  is unpredictable. There had been several cases of people going to the paddy 
  fields being shot by the STF and then unbelievable reasons given. There have 
  been incidents even under the PA government, which show that the people are 
  still denied normal justice. There was the well-known incident on 15<sup>th</sup> 
  September 1996 when <b>Ministers Ashraff &amp; Fowzie</b> were visiting Kalmunai. 
  Two students <b>Rameshkumar</b> and <b>Sivanandarajah</b> were stopped on the 
  road by the STF, whose detention was witnessed. Later, the bodies turned up 
  in the Kalmunai hospital mortuary. The Magistrate found the version given by 
  the STF contradictory and false. But the STF sub-inspector Ariyawansa received 
  a reward and a promotion on the grounds that they had killed two LTTE cadre 
  who came on bicycles and refused to stop, and so saved the ministers from being 
  killed by the LTTE. Then that was how the State turned several youths into suicide 
  bombers.<u1:p></u1:p></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>But then, what about the well-to-do 
  Tamils who support the LTTE? In 1995 when peace was within reach, instead of 
  pressing the LTTE to come to a political settlement, they praised the LTTE for 
  resuming the war in their fight for Tamil Eelam. Instead of giving this girl&#146;s 
  people peace and a chance to rebuild their life, they used their money to present 
  her with a suicide kit. When she exploded herself, they and their children applauded. 

  This is the state of Tamil nationalism today. The suicide bomber had the identity 
  card of <b>Yasoda Thilakaratnam</b> from Kolavil. After questioning the parents, 
  the Police have now found that <b>Yasoda Thilakaratnam</b>, who had a Sinhalese 
  mother, had joined the LTTE two years ago, but was not the suicide bomber in 
  question.<u1:p></u1:p><a href="#_Toc515621630">[Top]</a><u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<h2><a name="_Toc515621641"><span lang=EN-GB>Nationalism and Political Opportunism</span></a><a name="_Toc515621641"><span lang=EN-GB><u1:p></u1:p></span></a><span lang=EN-GB></span></h2>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>Tamil nationalism today, which is 
  articulated by the Tigers and the Tigers alone, has reached its nadir. Anyone 
  else in the nationalist game is there only as a satellite of the LTTE. It has 
  immense attractions for members of the Tamil diaspora who enjoy marginal status 
  in foreign lands. But for the Tamils who have to live in the North-East, it 
  has very limited attractions. To those in the Vanni celebrating the millennium 
  wondering at a 47 foot cut-out of <b>Prabhakaran</b> along with two huge maps 
  displaying what he has achieved and what he hopes to achieve, his boasts only 
  portend progressive destruction. Unlike to their expatriate compatriots savouring 
  the fruits of modernity, to those in the Vanni the monuments at Mallavi only 
  signal misery, landmines and mental trauma. <u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>Tamil nationalism as practised today 
  by its advocates and the Press has two parts to it. One is to rattle off a frightening 
  catalogue of disappearances, rapes, murders and massacres by the Sri Lankan 
  Forces and paint a picture where everything is black without a glimmer of hope. 
  Any question as to whether the Tamil nationalist leadership has acted responsibly 
  to protect the life and the interests of the Tamils is readily answered by citing 
  a few recent cases of rape and disappearance and posing the rhetorical question, 
  what could anyone have done with such incorrigible brutes as the Sinhalese? 
  Except in small Left circles, highly educated Tamils in the mainstream had ceased 
  to reflect on where this would carry the Tamils. In politics of this kind, upholding 
  the essential brutishness of the Sinhalese assumes top priority. When the <b>Krishanthy</b> 
  <b>Kumaraswamy</b> rape and murder trial had come to court, <b>Kumar Ponnambalam</b> 
  kept saying it was eyewash and that the accused would get away scot-free. When 
  the accused were given maximum sentences, those present in court saw in KP a 
  most disappointed man.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>The other part of the creed is that 
  since no good can come out of the Sinhalese, the LTTE is the only hope. It is 
  argued with considerable violence to history that without the LTTE no government 
  in Colombo would have talked about devolution or a political solution. The argument 
  is simply that because the Sinhalese are so vile and brutish, only the draconian 
  sacrifices demanded by the LTTE can bring the Tamils any relief. <u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>It could be upheld with some validity that the armed 
  struggle had an impact on the Sri Lankan Government and the Sinhalese polity, 
  pushing them to re-evaluate certain premises. At the same time it may be argued 
  that it was mainly Indian involvement and assistance that brought pressure on 
  the Government to agree to the solution contained in the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord. 
  If India did not come in the fate of the Tamils after the Vadamaratchi offensive 
  looked very uncertain. While these arguments have some merit, the important 
  thing is to understand the internal dynamism and other factors such as re-evaluation 
  in the South after &#145;83, apart from economical, social and other factors 
  which also need to be accounted for. But if we analyse the LTTE factor, its 

  role has always tended to destroy all benign development and to drive the Tamils 
  further away from peace with dignity. Thus, superficial claims which ignore 
  history and try to explain the present by isolating a few factors, and ignoring 
  others whose effect is hidden by being constant and prolonged, do violence to 
  reality.<u1:p></u1:p></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>Thus, to sustain the LTTE&#146;s dominance, 
  any Tamil who engages with the Government to bring relief to the Tamil people 
  is destroyed as a traitor. No such person should be allowed to succeed if this 
  politics is to survive. Thus, one Tamil daily had an editorial lamenting the 
  murder of <b>Neelan Thiruchelvam</b>. The next day the same paper carried a 
  cartoon showing a Tamil man&#146;s neck being cut by an instrument described 
  as &#145;moderation&#146;. So, the moderate Tamil politician Ne<b>elan Thiruchelvam 
  </b>had to be killed and his reputation sullied as a man destroying, rather 
  saving the Tamils. Being rattled by the condolence messages pouring in from 
  leading persons world-wide, the LTTE lobby lost their senses and indulged in 
  a clumsy orgy of character assassination. <u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>It is here that the hypocrisy of this 
  group becomes evident. The violence suffered by the Tamils in the course of 
  a war that was forced on them is a reality. But the LTTE supporting nationalists 
  would not allow the Tamil people at home to look at options apart from giving 
  their lives to the LTTE&#146;s cause. They deny to the tortured people in the 
  Vanni and the Tamil people in general the enormous relief available to them 
  from international law, world opinion and international institutions. Instead, 
  they try to pervert all international concern to strengthen the LTTE at great 
  cost to the people. But for themselves and theirs they keep all the options 
  open. They use every means to send their children abroad and often have excellent 
  contacts with the ruling establishment in Colombo and with international organisations 
  which protect even those who voice the LTTE&#146;s dogmas. <u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>Here is an irony, one could use the 
  protection of international institutions to go on telling young Tamils through 
  newspaper columns that there is absolutely no protection against the wickedness 
  of the Sri Lankan State. The indirect message being given to these young persons 
  is that they have no hope except to put on a suicide kit and die, while those 
  who spread this message to others&#146; children have plenty of hope that the 
  Sri Lankan government will be prevented from doing them any harm by organised 
  international concern. They zealously keep this protection just for themselves, 
  and will not allow it to extend to the ordinary Tamil people. <u1:p></u1:p><a href="#_Toc515621630">[Top]</a></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>The LTTE&#146;s success in stifling 
  protest within the Tamil community has gone hand in hand with transforming popular 
  attitudes to murder. The dominant politics and in turn the Press have together 
  played a leading role in effecting this transformation which has prepared the 
  ground for this auto-genocidal culture. In 1975, the feeling of outrage against 
  <b>Alfred Duraiyappah&#146;s</b> murder may not have been that widespread, particularly 
  among the younger generation, as he had been subject to prolonged political 
  character assassination in the nationalist media. And yet, there was still the 
  freedom to express outrage. A large number of people had attended his funeral 
  since fear had not gripped the community. Today a political murder is greeted 
  - the lead coming from the Press - with approval or censure depending only on 
  who committed the murder and what the person&#146;s role was. A person killed 
  by the LTTE must necessarily be a traitor and so asked for it, and a person 
  helping the LTTE or speaking for its cause who was killed must be a hero or 
  patriot. This has given rise to pressing dilemmas that have not been addressed.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><b><span
lang=EN-GB>Nadesan Satyendra</span></b><span
lang=EN-GB> was secretary to the labour ministry in the <b>Jayewarden</b>e Government 
  and was closely associated with <b>Gamini Dissanayake&#146;s</b> ambitions, 
  but is today a leading LTTE spokesman.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><b><span
lang=EN-GB>Kumar Ponnambalam</span></b><span
lang=EN-GB> was in alliance with the SLFP and MEP in the 1988 presidential election 
  and was a vocal critic of the LTTE before his conversion in 1994.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>From 1990-94, <b>Nadarajah</b> <b>Ramesh</b> 
  was a sworn enemy of the LTTE. Even in Colombo, his party, the EPDP, was in 
  league with the security forces and <b>Ramesh</b> himself was involved in killings 
  of suspected LTTE sympathisers. <b>Prabhakaran</b> would never have forgiven 
  him for the popular radio satire in which the Leader was effectively lampooned. 
  His conversion too came in 1994 as a survival gambit.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>Had these persons been killed in an 
  earlier phase of their life they would have been contemptible traitors. But 
  they lived to have the chance of &#145;conversion&#146; and exercise their right 
  to freedom of speech in favour of the LTTE. They lived to become public figures, 
  heroes and patriots and two of them in death became martyrs or &#145;Supremely 
  Great Men&#146;.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>Some have had the misfortune of having 
  their status subsequently made unclear<b>. Kandiah Perinpanathan</b> and <b>Kandiah 
  Gajendran</b> were top ranking LTTE operatives in the West under La<b>wrence 
  Thilagar</b>. On 26<sup>th</sup> October 1996, they were gunned down in Boulevard 
  la Chapelle in Paris. In a statement issued from London on 9<sup>th</sup> November 
  1996, the Leader commended the deceased as persons to whom &#145;the Tamil liberation 
  movement owes a gratitude&#146; and blamed their murder on the &#145;enemy&#146;.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>In early 1997, <b>Thilagar</b> who 
  justified the LTTE&#146;s murders and evoked dread among overseas Tamils was 
  suddenly re-called to the Vanni. The man and his reputation collapsed into the 
  obscurity of the Mullaitivu jungles. Rumours started surfacing that the Paris 
  murders were an internal job and that <b>Thilagar </b>who had become too big 
  for the Leader&#146;s liking had been cut down to size as others who had made 
  the mistake before him. Today no one is sure whether <b>Perinpanathan</b> and 
  <b>Gajendran</b> are martyrs or traitors. It has now fallen to Sri Lankan police 
  investigators to determine the status of <b>Ponnambalam</b> and <b>Ramesh</b>.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>Today&#146;s Tamil political culture 
  is one which suffers from a state of anarchy in which there is no objective 
  standard to determine a person&#146;s contribution. It belittles the whole community. 
  The Tamils who back the LTTE have an obligation to ask the Leader a couple of 
  questions: If <b>Ponnambalam</b> could one day be a traitor and given time to 
  see the truth, become a &#145;Supremely Great Man&#146;, why was not this opportunity 
  given to the thousands killed in LTTE torture camps? Why was not this opportunity 
  given to <b>Neelan Thiruchelvam</b>?<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>A young man being ordered to sacrifice his life and 
  in the process destroy that of another who, like <b>Neelan Thiruchelvam</b> 
  for example, is not by any means a military thereat to the LTTE, raises many 
  serious and pertinent questions not only about the Leader who ordered it, but 
  also about the status of our community which glorifies and justifies that Leader. 
  Why are we unable to raise issues and evaluate the level of insanity to which 
  our community has degraded itself? Even Tamil papers published by the so called 
  national NGOs which are funded by international organisations to promote democracy 
  and human values, failed miserably in this endeavour. Their gamely approach 
  to the dominant political trend among the Tamils exemplifies a frightening level 
  of degeneration in the whole relationship. These organisations have been unable 
  to build a coherent and meaningful approach to the real crisis. <u1:p></u1:p></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>In supporting the LTTE&#146;s political line, both 
  <b>Ponnambalam</b> and <b>Ramesh</b> justified killings of individuals by the 
  LTTE and belittled the dead. <b>Ramesh</b> character assassinated <b>A.Thangathurai</b> 
  and <b>Neelan Thiruchelvam</b> after they were murdered by the LTTE. Both vanished 
  into the cesspool of their own undertakings. A poignant observation was made 
  on the tragedy of <b>Ramesh</b>: &#147;His readers lost the ability to think. 
  They ceased to have opinions about the events around them. Today the Tamil people 
  have no opinion about the murder of <b>Ramesh</b>.&#148; How can we come out 
  of this fate? Time is long past where these killings had ceased to be isolated 
  incidents that could analysed individually. <b>A healthy turn in the future 
  of the Tamils requires that they rediscover values to see murder - any murder 
  - as abhorrent in itself. It is vital that we create a movement to give muscle 
  and expression to the dormant public outrage against the political trend which 
  manipulates minds so as to cheapen life. Only this can restore sanity to the 
  community. Although it involves taking risks, it is this that should be the 
  priority of religious and political leaders, social activists and leaders of 
  civil society in the Tamil Community.<u1:p><span lang=EN-GB><u1:p></u1:p><a href="#_Toc515621630">[Top]</a></span></u1:p></b></p>
<h2><a name="_Toc515621643"><span lang=EN-GB>The State and the Tamil People</span></a><u1:p></u1:p></h2>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>A persisting element of the State 
  that has not been decisively challenged is again brought out by the rape and 
  murder of the young mother <b>Sarathammal</b> in Pungudutivu on 28<sup>th</sup> 
  December 1999. The offenders were four naval personnel from the detachment at 
  Pungudutivu. When the brother <b>Rajasekaran</b>, who was tied up during the 
  incident, made inquiries at the navy camp the next day, he was told that all 
  the men were inside and it could not be the Navy. The body was found later and 
  when the matter received publicity, the President ordered an inquiry. It is 
  here that the problem arises. If the President does not intervene, the system 
  will cover up. A recent report in the Press stated that according to the CID 
  witnesses are not coming forward. This is understandable among people who have 
  to live with the Navy in a fairly lonely place, unless they are sure that the 
  State would protect them. No doubt, the murder of <b>Kumar Ponnambalam</b> would 
  have increased their anxiety. <u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>We see this same pattern in many of 
  the major cases of violations. When an air force pilot bombed refugees at St.Peter 
  and St.Paul&#146;s, Navaly, in 1995, the President promised an inquiry and then 
  the matter was covered up. When schoolchildren at Nagar Kovil were bombed, the 
  incident was denied by the Defence Ministry, and covered up. In the <b>Krishanthy 
  Kumarasamy</b> case, the brigadier or his superior generals in Jaffna could 
  have identified and apprehended the culprits in no time. But the defence authorities 
  kept up their denial until the matter threatened to go out of control and the 
  President ordered an inquiry. <u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><b><span
lang=EN-GB>All these have one disturbing feature. If it is a question of rape, 
  murder or pilot error in targeting a bomb by an individual, or a small group 
  of individuals, it is no more than a crime or culpable homicide if the system 
  immediately makes them answerable. But when the system&#146;s natural impulse 
  is to cover up, it becomes much more than a crime of an individual or individuals. 
  It becomes the mark of an oppressive system - of the State. That is very dangerous. 
  <u1:p></u1:p></span></b></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>In this situation, when members of 
  the LTTE propaganda wing, the Tamil newspapers or Tamil nationalist politicians 
  tell Tamil youth that the Tamil people are up against the system that is bent 
  on raping Tamil women and destroying the Tamil people, it contains more than 
  a germ of truth. It is a major failure of the PA Government that we still have 
  not got this aspect of the State behind us. <u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<h2><a name="_Toc515621644"><span lang=EN-GB>The Challenge before the Government 
  and the People</span></a><u1:p></u1:p></h2>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>Following the murder of <b>Kumar Ponnambalam</b> 
  there is such a disturbing air of fear among the Tamils in Colombo that we have 
  not had for five years. Those talking about the murder are not being told by 
  others that there is a killer agency of the state targeting individuals. They 
  are too scared to suggest anything of that kind. Rather, they are saying, &#147;You 
  have a wife and children, you must think about them&#148;. The suggestion, even 
  if untrue, is not a ridiculous one. During UNP rule, the State built up agencies 
  which freely indulged in extra-judicial killings. Famous among those which operated 
  in the North-East were the ones headed by <b>Munas</b> and <b>Suresh Cassim</b>. 
  <b>Munas</b> had been sighted in an STF camp in the Eye Hospital area in 1995 
  during the time of the PA government, after 20 bodies turned up in lakes around 
  Colombo. These units are intact and have only been biding their time, hoping 
  perhaps for a UNP government where it would be business as usual. Columnists 
  and activists concerned with human rights fear that some of these units may 
  have jumped at the President&#146;s remarks about not tolerating any leanings 
  towards terrorism, to take matters into their own hands.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>During UNP rule in the 1980s, the 
  State&#146;s links with the underworld became a fact of life. To some extent, 
  this has been continued under the PA. One consequence of this is that, had not 
  the head of the suicide bomber been found, the murder of <b>General Algama</b> 
  would have been readily attributed to the PA government. Such are things this 
  country can today ill afford. The public morality of the Government must be 
  above board.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>Another potential element of volatility 
  is the Army. <b>President Jayewardene</b> politicised it. Politicians with indefensible 
  and oppressive goals felt more secure when they could break the system and place 
  personal appointees in top positions of the Security Services. For a time, it 
  gave the President an illusion of unchallenged power. It was only an illusion 
  because the President could not know what was going on below. By 1987 the system 
  was in deep crisis and was cracking up. Although the political establishment 
  was reluctant to reach any accommodation with the Tamils, the Army was tired. 
  A group of influential army officers was preparing to ask the President to offer 
  the Tamils federalism. Even after the resumption of war in 1990, it was clear 
  that good sections of the security forces were wary of political extremism in 
  the South. The extremists could make the political waters murky by holding out 
  against reasonable accommodation with the Tamils, but could not for all their 
  eloquence send a dozen of recruits to the war front. Instead, they frightened 
  the Tamils and made the war more bitter and costly.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>By making little headway in bringing 
  devolution and accountable government closer to the Tamils, the present Government 
  has for the last five years been banking heavily on the security forces, allowing 
  their side of the job to go by default. The Army has been pushed to perform 
  according to political timetables, while the politicians did little to make 
  their job easier. Thus, the same mistaken strategies followed by earlier UNP 
  governments have been perpetuated.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>Defence is by far is the heaviest 
  item of expenditure in the budget and is all on account of the Tamil problem. 
  How many ministers in the Cabinet sit down and think about how to solve this 
  problem? One gets the impression that this whole area of activity has been left 
  to the Deputy Defence Minister. And as the recent election campaign and the 
  active backing of security forces in the North-East for the UNP indicated, the 
  Army was ready to pack up and go home. All this indicates a poor quality of 
  governance. <u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>Thus the Government&#146;s failure 
  to bring immediate relief to the victims of violations by the security forces 
  and the ongoing covering up, are indeed very costly for the country as a whole. 
  The Foreign Minister&#146;s statement to the visiting UN group on disappearances 
  last September, citing the excavations in Jaffna, that there are no mass graves 
  there, is again a costly blunder, which will not impress anyone except the die-hard 
  chauvinists in Colombo. The issue is after all, not mass graves in Jaffna, but 
  hundreds of unaccounted disappearances. Such statements go to show that after 
  five years there is no clearly thought out policy or strategy within the Government 
  to address the Tamil problem.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>Instead, we are today being treated 
  to re-enactments of conspiracy theories like J<b>ayewardene&#146;s</b> Naxalite 
  plot of 1982. These are unnecessarily divisive and cannot bring any good<b>. 
  Jayewardene</b> used his Naxalite story to sabotage democracy. In 1982 with 
  a five-sixths majority in Parliament and undated resignation letters of MPs 
  in his pocket, he seemed all-powerful. But this set off a series of destructive 
  processes and by 1988, he was a broken man hoping that the Indian Army would 
  keep him in power. This should not be forgotten.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>Unfortunately, the recent unquestioning 
  drift in the Press and a section of the NGOs towards the UNP has left them with 
  few arguments to resist a similar abuse of power by the present Government. 
  These groups which are essentially watchdog bodies should get back to creating 
  room for raising concerns of the ordinary people and so reform the political 
  culture in this country. Watchdogs perform badly in the clothes of power brokers. 
  Their task is to uphold morality in public life. A country can survive the depredations 
  of terrorists, but not state functionaries who descend to the level of terrorists.<u1:p></u1:p><a href="#_Toc515621630">[Top]</a></span></p>
