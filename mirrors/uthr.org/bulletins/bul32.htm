style='font-family:"Times New Roman";'>1.After Hakone</span></a><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman";'></span></h3>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>Contrary to hopes raised by the ceasefire and the MoU, impunity 
  persists in the North-East, especially on the part of the LTTE. The two crucial 
  and inseparable areas of violations that we have consistently highlighted are 
  child conscription and attacks on political opponents. The two go on in parallel 
  and independently of each other with slack periods followed by periods of intense 
  activity. At present child conscription appears to have subsided while the LTTE&#146;s 
  intelligence activity and targeted killings have intensified, both in the North-East 
  and the South, as the LTTE endeavours to eradicate political opponents and military 
  enemies. </span></p>
<p>By the end of April newspapers were reporting that at least 15 Tamils working 
  as informants to the Sri Lankan military had been killed since the beginning 
  of the cease-fire in February 2002. The latest killing occurred in Colombo 
  on April 26<sup>th</sup>, causing the Government to launch a long delayed investigation. 
  Reports of surveillance, harassment, abduction and murder of rival Tamil political 
  party members have also increased.</p>
<p>It appears that the LTTE has adopted a programme of first things first. In 
  Batticaloa after the Hakone talks, the LTTE spread the word that whatever was 
  said in the press about the peace talks, each family was still required to provide 
  a child recruit. But intense scrutiny on the issue has made conscripting children 
  outright more difficult. Since Hakone, the LTTE has launched a renewed effort 
  to silence independent local observers and political groups. Their policy: elections 
  and democracy, yes, but after killing or crippling the remaining political opposition. 
</p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>Thus the universally eulogized peace talks, and the prospect 
  of local elections, far from ushering in hope, have become the sound of doom. 
  It is no exaggeration to say that many of the LTTE&#146;s courageous and outspoken 
  political opponents, especially in the East, are living a confined existence, 
  as it were, on death row.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>Norway and Japan are the main external actors dealing directly 
  with the LTTE. Their bottom-line has appeared to be that human rights must be 
  pushed, but not beyond a point where the LTTE might break off talks. This may 
  partially explain why the LTTE&#146;s continuing attacks on Tamil opposition 
  groups has not featured as a critical concern in the peace process, even though 
  any entity promoting resolution of this conflict would unhesitatingly acknowledge 
  how critical democratic participation is to lasting peace.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>In fact, in April the LTTE at least temporarily broke off 
  talks in spite of the diplomatic soft-pedalling. Reacting to a perceived slight 
  when the Sri Lankan government participated in a meeting with donors in Washington, 
  DC that the LTTE was barred by US anti-terrorism laws from attending, the LTTE 
  withdrew from talks scheduled for Thailand in late April; a major aid conference 
  Japan is hosting from June 9<sup>th</sup> &#150; 10<sup>th</sup> in Tokyo; and 
  also pulled out of a joint panel on humanitarian needs in the North-East. This 
  was followed by a soap operatic interlude when Minister Moragoda threatened 
  not to participate in peace talks, alleging that LTTE political leader Thamichelvan 
  had misquoted him to the <i>Sunday Leader</i> (27.4.03) as having promised to 
  wangle for the LTTE an invitation to the Washington meeting. </span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>The Minister who had been very tolerant of the LTTE bringing 
  the ultimate misery to thousands through child conscription, abduction and murder 
  in the name of peace, was waxing loud with moral indignation over a storm in 
  a teacup. The LTTE&#146;s spokesman Anton Balasingham, who has been at pains 
  to say that their absence from talks does not necessarily signal a return to 
  war, was more than ready to smother Moragoda with apologies (for an alleged 
  translation error!) and be pals again. For the present, at least, the moves 
  on all sides appear to be a game of brinksmanship.</span></p>
<p>The most alarming piece of cynicism in this regard came from the SLMM &#150; 
  essentially a voice of the Norwegian government. On 20<sup>th</sup> March, during 
  the talks in Hakone, Japan, the LTTE attacked and sank a Chinese fishing trawler 
  off Mullaitivu, killing 17 of its crew. In a bid to exonerate the LTTE, the 
  SLMM in its reflections on the incident pointed its finger at the hapless Tamil 
  opponents of the LTTE! The scene of the incident is a few miles off the Mullaitivu 
  coast, which the LTTE zealously controls. It would have been dangerous or suicidal 
  for anyone else to come there in small fishing boats, the kind in which the 
  attackers reportedly came. The Navy passes that way in fast patrol boats, which 
  journey between KKS and Trinco. Not even the LTTE has suggested that the Navy, 
  which rescued the nine survivors whom the attackers had tried to finish off, 
  committed the crime. </p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>The US is now being widely acknowledged as a key player, the 
  threat of whose destructive power, it is thought, had kept the LTTE from breaking 
  off completely from negotiations. The US called upon the LTTE to formally &#145;renounce 
  violence and terrorism&#146; while heaping praise on the peace process. Whatever 
  the nuances the LTTE has gathered from these expressions, it apparently feels 
  more confident about killing its political opponents. Complicity on the part 
  of the Government is now taken for granted.</span></p>
<p>Notably, at the Hakone talks during the third week of March, both the Government 
  and the LTTE rejected proposals for international monitoring of a human rights 
  agreement. They opted instead for monitoring by the Human Rights Commission 
  (HRC), knowing well that the HRC are neither equipped for monitoring under the 
  prevailing environment of terror, nor have they established public credibility 
  to an extent that can give confidence. The LTTE once more pledged to drop child 
  conscription and agreed to the holding of local council elections in the North-East.</p>

style='font-family:"Times New Roman";'></span></h3>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>Having got the message that the MoU will do little to prevent 
  or punish political killings, the LTTE is now quite open about it. Members of 
  opposition parties, particularly in the East, dare not leave their political 
  offices. They visit their homes at great risk. The incidents below illustrate 
  the kind of impunity the LTTE enjoys now. Even in the heart of Batticaloa town, 
  LTTE spies quite openly hang out with cell phones. When they spot a target they 
  summon the death squads who would come promptly on motorcycles or auto rickshaws. 
  Under the MoU, the LTTE&#146;s political opponents have been deprived of the 
  weapons they had for their protection, while the LTTE goes about with arms and 
  has shot people in public, while the Police and the Army did nothing. In Jaffna 
  things can be subtler and for that reason more chilling. (See the Atputharajah 
  murder below.)</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>In Batticaloa the LTTE could silence the Tamil community by 
  getting rid of a handful of individuals, whose survival all these years needs 
  to be marvelled at. In Jaffna and in Muslim areas the LTTE faces a far greater 
  challenge. Among those most vulnerable in the East are members of the EPRLF(V) 
  and EPDP. UTHR(J) have reliable information that in targeting certain leaders, 
  the LTTE has approached some former members of these groups to gain access to 
  their party offices and kill for a cash reward. The deterrence of the law has 
  become a non-issue. This will be seen in the cases below. <a href="#_Toc39625273">[Top]</a></span></p>

<p><b><span lang=EN-GB>Kadirgamanathan Ragupathy (35):</span></b><span lang=EN-GB> 
  was once a member of the PLOTE and was of late attached to the Directorate of 
  Military Intelligence. Married and a father of two children, he was living in 
  Colombo after the ceasefire (December 2001). He has become the fourth such person 
  to be killed by the LTTE contrary to the MoU, but using the access it provided. 
  Late in the evening of 18<sup>th</sup> March he was gunned down by LTTE assassins 
  who came on a motorcycle. This happened in Mt. Lavinia, on Galle Road, as he 
  was approaching St. Sylvester&#146;s Rd. where he had a room. The circumstances 
  point to LTTE spotters with cell-phones covering the area and summoning the 
  hit men when the victim was sighted.</span></p>
<p><b><span lang=EN-GB>Killers in Colombo:</span></b><span lang=EN-GB> The irony 
  of the incident is that it was expected. Ragupathy had told Military Intelligence 
  that he was being trailed. That the probable killer, <b>Sivakumar</b>, had left 
  Batticaloa for Colombo the previous day was known, and warnings had been sent 
  to vulnerable persons and political groups in Colombo. It is well known in the 
  Tamil community that senior LTTE intelligence operatives who were earlier functioning 
  in the Vanni or Interior Batticaloa, from where they sent instructions to operatives 
  in the South, have, under the MoU, set up shop in Colombo and have even been 
  seen in public with their bodyguards. They do their fieldwork without any bother 
  from the Sri Lankan authorities and summon their hit men, who are strangers 
  in Colombo, to do the job and vanish. Sivakumar was back in Batticaloa the next 
  day.</span></p>
<p><b><span lang=EN-GB>Varathan</span></b><span
lang=EN-GB> led a breakaway group from TELO in Araiampathy, south of Batticaloa. 
  He had been a member of the local council and worked for the PA during the last 
  elections. TELO had worked closely with the Army from 1990 &#150; perhaps the 
  only means the local cadre had to protect themselves &#150; but its leadership 
  fell in with the LTTE and is part of the TNA. The MoU enabled the LTTE to target 
  members of Varathan&#146;s group with little hindrance and now it seems to be 
  open season. Varathan had gone to Colombo and returned recently.</span></p>
<p><b><span lang=EN-GB>On the morning of 2<sup>nd</sup> April, Varathan was in 
  front of the Ariampathy Hospital talking to the OIC, Police, Kattankudy, when 
  Sivakumar of the LTTE passed them on a motor cycle, going towards Kalmunai. 
  Sivakumar turned back, came towards them, whipped out his pistol (which the 
  MoU does not allow him or Varathan to have), and fired at Varathan. Surprised, 
  Varathan, who was unarmed, started running. Sivakumar got down from his motorcycle, 
  gave a chase, and pumped several bullets into Varathan. This was seen by several 
  people, who asked the police inspector why he did nothing. The inspector pleaded 
  that he was unarmed.</span></b></p>
<p><b><span lang=EN-GB>Mylvaganam Sivakumar (28)</span></b><span lang=EN-GB> heads 
  the LTTE intelligence in Batticaloa town and had been 6 years in the LTTE. A 
  native of Pudur, he answers directly to the Batticaloa &#150; Amparai Intelligence 
  Chief, Ramanan, and is said to have received special training in stalking and 
  killing individuals. It was under his supervision that three senior EPDP members 
  in Batticaloa were abducted on 3<sup>rd</sup> December 2002 (<a href="bul31.htm">Bulletin 
  No.31</a>). For his work he has reportedly been assigned a van, two motorcycles, 
  weapons and 5 bodyguards. Until now his actions against opposition party members 
  had been low key. Since December his men have been stalking, mostly in the night, 
  homes, offices and routes of opposition party members and we have reported several 
  attempts on them. On 17<sup>th</sup> February, he threw a grenade at the house 
  of Thurairatnam, leader of the EPRLF(V) in Batticaloa.<a href="#_Toc39625273">[Top]</a></span></p>

  about Sivakumar&#146;s actions have been made to the SLMM, the Human Rights 
  Commission and the Police, but nothing has been done. Following Sivakumar&#146;s 
  public murder of Varathan, an order for his arrest was made by the Batticaloa 
  Magistrate. Sivakumar continues to ride around Batticaloa town by broad daylight 
  without the slightest impediment. The current orders to the LTTE intelligence 
  wing are to kill members of the opposition expeditiously. Earlier, in December, 
  the Magistrate ordered the Police to arrest Rajan and Paramanathan over the 
  murder of EPRLF(V) local council chairman Alahathurai in Mandur. The two continue 
  at large.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>The SLMM has been notably silent on the murder of members 
  of opposition groups and of Tamils in the security forces, apart from using 
  them as scapegoats to exonerate the LTTE. When approached by opposition parties 
  about their security, the SLMM directed them to the Police. The Police and the 
  Army in turn have spoken of the absence of instructions from the top. <b>In 
  effect the LTTE goes about killing like vigilante units during the JVP era, 
  while the Police look the other side.</b> It is the same police force that a 
  few years ago showed an astounding prowess for picking up in a single day a 
  thousand or more &#145;Tamil Terrorist Suspects&#146; in Colombo! Whenever the 
  Police are made to look ridiculous, the situation is ominous.</span></p>
<p><b><span lang=EN-GB>Amirthalingam Rasan (18)</span></b><span lang=EN-GB> was 
  from a very poor family in Analaitivu (The Islands) who had been a member of 
  the EPDP for a year. According to his mother Amirthalingam Selvamalar, who has 
  five other sons, the LTTE had sent her several letters to bring Rasan to their 
  office. Rasan declined to comply. In the afternoon of 4<sup>th</sup> April he 
  was abducted by the LTTE when he left the EPDP office in Mallakam and was tortured 
  in an abandoned house in Soorawattai, Chunnakam. With help from villagers his 
  body was discovered in the lavatory pit of that house on 7<sup>th</sup> April. 
  Owing to the circumstances, the post mortem on Rasan&#146;s corpse and the interment 
  were done in Colombo. The kind of information the LTTE tries to extract from 
  opposition party members comes from the testimony of an EPDP escapee from LTTE 
  custody. It gives a curious insight into the LTTE&#146;s preparations for peace. 
  Much of his story has appeared in the Press (e.g. <i>Sunday Times,</i> 13<sup>th</sup>

<p><b><span lang=EN-GB>Selliah Param (23)</span></b><span lang=EN-GB> of the EPDP 
  went to Killinochi on 31<sup>st</sup> March to meet his elder sister and family 
  whom he had not met for many years. This is well within the provisions of the 
  Ceasefire Agreement. He was arrested by the LTTE after being seen by a reporter 
  known to him. He was held in a dark underground bunker in notoriously subhuman 
  conditions, where he met members of other groups and also Sinhalese speakers, 
  whom he was told were members of the security forces.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>Two days later he was beaten and interrogated while being 
  shown photographs of senior EPDP leaders, some of them crossed in red. The information 
  being elicited was to facilitate murder &#150; e.g. the source of the EPDP leader&#146;s 
  meals and his movements.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>At this stage an LTTE cadre Kumar whispered to him that staying 
  there was fatal and he should somehow escape. The chief interrogator learnt 
  of this, shot Kumar dead in his presence and got him (Param) to clean up the 
  mess.</span></p>
<p>Param was then moved to a makeshift cell, which he shared with a member of 
  the PLOTE, who was detained 4 months ago. The latter had obtained an instrument 
  of sorts during forced labour during the day. They managed to undo the lock, 
  and finding the two guards asleep, made their escape. Being a local, the PLOTE 
  man knew the area, and led Param to the main road near Killinochchi, where they 
  climbed a tree and waited for the dawn. The PLOTE man showed him the SLMM office 
  and went his way. While Param was with the SLMM, Thamilchelvan&#146;s office 
  called and asked the SLMM to hand him over to the LTTE Police. At Param&#146;s

<p><b><span lang=EN-GB>The Incident in Chelvanagar, Araiyampathy, Batticaloa District:</span></b><span
lang=EN-GB> Following the murder of Varathan, some members of his group had held 
  talks with a view to joining the EPDP. The incident which took place about 11.30 
  PM on 13<sup>th</sup> April, Traditional New Year&#146;s Eve, was described 
  by <i>Tamilnet</i> in these terms<i>: &#147;Alagathurai Ganesan (30), a father 
  of 3 children , and Mr.Vinoth, a member of the Varathan group, were killed and 
  8 people were wounded in a grenade attack, allegedly by the paramilitary Varathan 
  group,</i> <i>and subsequent shooting&#133;, sources said. Four members of the 
  Varathan group and four women were admitted to the teaching hospital in Batticaloa 
  with injuries sustained in the attack.&#148;</i></span></p>
<p><i><span lang=EN-GB>Tamilnet</span></i> added<i>: &#147;Sources said that inebriated 
  members of the Varathan group visited &#145;Selva Nagar&#146;&#133; and started 
  attacking villagers. Mr. Ganeshan had resisted the attacks and the Varathan 
  group had then visited the home where Mr. Ganeshan was staying and lobbed grenades. 
  Mr. Ganeshan died and two women in the house were injured, the sources said. 
  Following this there was shooting.&#148;</i></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>This story is palpably at variance with the forensic evidence. 
  The dead civilian (Ganeshan) and the five dead and injured members of Varathan&#146;s 
  group had gun shot injuries in addition to grenade blast injuries. The four 
  injured women had grenade injuries.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>The basic facts are that the LTTE was in the area targeting 
  the Varathan group, who were celebrating the New Year. Thilak, a member of the 
  Varathan group (one of the injured), went to a boutique to buy cigarettes shortly 
  before midnight and got into a fight with Ganeshan, which was joined by others. 
  Some villagers informed other members of the Varathan group who came to Thilak&#146;s 
  aid. The shooting was clearly by the LTTE.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>As to how the fight started, Thilak apparently went into Ganeshan&#146;s 
  premises to intervene in a noisy quarrel between Ganeshan and his wife, where, 
  reportedly, a girl married to an LTTE cadre, Jegan, was also staying. The incident, 
  we learn, took place in Ganeshan&#146;s premises. While a complete account is 
  so far lacking, a material fact in determining whether anyone from the Varathan 
  group threw a grenade, is that no injury to the LTTE has been reported, as against 
  five casualties from the Varathan group with grenade and bullet injuries.</span></p>
<p><b><span lang=EN-GB>Raveendrakumar (Ravi), </span></b><span lang=EN-GB>a Tamil 
  who works for army intelligence, was shot and badly injured by the LTTE near 
  his home in Batticaloa. The Army later picked up 3 LTTE men who have been remanded 
  by the Magistrate for an identification parade. Ravi was first taken to Batticaloa 
  Hospital. It was after others told the Army that the LTTE would finish him off 
  there that he was transferred to Colombo.</span></p>
<p><b><span lang=EN-GB>Marimuthu Rasalingam (Jegathes) (42)</span></b><span lang=EN-GB> 
  was a bank employee from Karaitivu, south of Kalmunai, who joined the EPRLF 
  and worked in their publications, and in the early 1990s joined the EPDP. He 
  was on the fringes of the party and his inclination was to vanish into the obscurity 
  of civilian life. He was sickly and went about on a bicycle on his own without 
  any security. Last year he became chairman of the Alaiyadi Vembu Urban Council 
  in Akkaraipattu.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>On 18<sup>th</sup> April, Jegathes left Karaitivu for Akkaraipattu 
  to sign some cheques at the local council and it was known that he was coming. 
  He was shot dead by LTTE men who came on two motorcycles without number plates 
  when he emerged from Sagamam Road on to the main road in Akkaraipattu. It was 
  obviously well planned and co-ordinated. Other sources reported that the killers 
  had been sent from Ramanan&#146;s Intelligence HQ in Palugamam and got back 
  there soon after the murder.</span></p>
<p><b><span lang=EN-GB>Selliah Puvanendran (53)</span></b><span lang=EN-GB> was

  Puvenendran&#146;s wife was working in Vavuniya and apparently owing to some 
  differences Puvanendran had come to live with his mother in Point Pedro. <i>Tamilnet 
  </i>suggested that Puvanendran was a member of the Sri Lankan Army volunteer 
  force. This has been denied by others who knew the party. At this point whatever

<p><b><span lang=EN-GB>Maclan Atputharajah (52)</span></b> was a father of five 
  and was president of the Chavakachcheri mini bus owner&#146;s association. He 
  was efficient, fluent in all three languages, and was notably firm in not letting 
  the LTTE dictate terms to the association. Prior to the displacement in 2000, 
  the LTTE had asked him for Rs. 5 lakhs. The wife, who was afraid, reportedly 
  went without her husband&#146;s knowledge, gave them Rs. 50,000/- and told them 
  that they do not have more. When they returned to Chavakachcheri recently, the 
  LTTE demanded money again. There were also rumours that Atputharajah, who was 
  known to be sympathetic to the EPRLF (V), would become its candidate at the 
  coming local council elections. About 9 PM on the night of 23<sup>rd</sup> April, 
  Atputharajah, closed his bar and was returning home by van with his helper <b>Poothan 
  Chandrakumar (27).</b> </p>
<p>They were waylaid by 6 masked men in black trousers and T-shirts who came in 
  another ash coloured van, carrying with them poles and knives. They waited just 
  inside a lane off Kandy Road, between the CSI Church and Drieberg College, where 
  there is an army sentry point. At the approach of Atputharajah&#146;s vehicle, 
  the waiting van dashed out to the road and stalled the coming vehicle against 
  a pile of stones. Atputharajah was beaten and stabbed while seated in the van, 
  and again after being dragged out. The assailants finished the job and vanished 
  within four minutes. Atputharajah died while being taken to hospital by members 
  of the public. Chandrakumar escaped with stab injuries. Atputharajah normally 
  went home on a motorcycle. This meant that his movements, including the change 
  to a van, had been monitored and passed on. The Police have arrested two men, 
  Kili and Thanges, who had quarrelled with the deceased. </p>
<p><b><span lang=EN-GB>The Anatomy of the Atputharajah Murder:</span></b><span lang=EN-GB> 
  Thanges was the owner of a minibus and had been suspended by the Minibus Owners&#146; 
  Association (MOA) for breaking rules. Although Thanges was known for a sharp 
  tongue, he was thought incapable of premeditated murder by those who knew him, 
  nor did he have the contacts for the kind of action that took place. Kili had 
  a quarrel with Atputharajah&#146;s son who owned a shop. He was known to have 
  friends in Thunnalai, Vadamaratchy, who are rough elements. But friends of the 
  deceased, who checked up in Vadamaratchy, said that these friends were in Thunnalai 
  that evening and had not left the place.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>The kind of organized gangsterism involved, with other tell-tale 
  signs, point the finger clearly at the LTTE. Atputharajah&#146;s body was released 
  by the hospital the following (24<sup>th</sup>) morning and the funeral was 
  fixed for the next day. The family wrote up a notice and the <i>Uthayan</i> 
  correspondent in Chavakacheri agreed to put it in next day&#146;s edition as 
  a news item. The correspondent passed it on to his Jaffna office through the 
  driver of Jeweller V.M. Kanapathipillai who also had a branch in Jaffna. The 
  driver confirmed that it was delivered. But the paper failed to publish it the 
  following day. The statement issued and delivered to the <i>Uthayan</i> by the 
  Minibus Owners&#146; Association met with the same fate.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>The MOA took issue with reporters on the day of the funeral 
  for not informing the public of an event that was undoubtedly newsworthy. The 
  reporters, who felt bad, told the MOA to parade their buses as a mark of protest 
  and that they would photograph it and publish it. The parade did take place, 
  but the reporters did not turn up! When Atputharajah recently had an age-attaining 
  ceremony for his daughter, eight LTTE men turned up, apparently uninvited. But 
  only one LTTE man turned up for the funeral, and moreover, at the time the coffin 
  was being removed.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>The family of the deceased and other concerned persons expressed 
  their dissatisfaction about the murder to the LTTE, who promised in earnest 
  that they would investigate and find the killers. More than a week later, there 
  were no signs of any investigation. The LTTE had questioned neither family nor 
  friends. This was rather like the promised investigation into the brutal assault 
  on the Hartley College Principal last September.</span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN-GB>On looking 
  back, two events stand out. A week before the murder, unknown persons had woken 
  up Atputharajah at his home at 1.00 AM and wanted him to come with them. Fearing 
  what it might mean, the natural response of people under such circumstances 
  is to think of escape and not to ask too many questions. The men said that a 
  vehicle had met with an accident at Sangathanai, a mile east of Chavakacheri, 
  and wanted his help to remove the vehicle. Atputharajah told them to go to the 
  Police and that he would come the first thing in the morning. He discovered 
  the next morning that there had been no such incident near Chavakacheri.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>A month earlier, Ilamparithy, the LTTE&#146;s political commissar 
  for Jaffna, himself a Thenmaratchy man, attended a meeting of the Minibus Owners&#146; 
  Association. He had earlier opposed Atputharajah being made its president. At 
  the meeting Ilamparithy patted Atputharajah on the back genially, and told him, 
  <i>&#145;Hanuman, I have earlier saved your life!&#146;</i> Hanuman was Atputharajah&#146;s 
  nickname locally. There were two unknown faces at the meeting. Atputharajah 
  inquired who they were. Ilamparithy replied casually, <i>&#145;They are our 
  boys&#146;</i>. In retrospect, it was a chilling encounter, whose significance 
  falls into place.</span></p>
<p>In Chavakacheri itself, the public is convinced that the LTTE is behind the 
  killing and talk about it less. It lays bare the sinister significance of the 
  MoU that is still talked of as an achievement. Friends of the family are in 
  a dilemma about what to do with the two men in police custody, whom they now 
  believe are being harassed, and almost certainly beaten, for no reason. </p>
<p><b><span lang=EN-GB>24<sup>th</sup> April:</span></b><span lang=EN-GB> <b>Grenades

  Cross St. and Hospital Road, Jaffna, and at the PLOTE office nearby. The grenades 
  did not explode though the pins had been removed. The army disposal team exploded 
  the grenade that had fallen outside the PLOTE office and removed the one from 
  inside the restaurant for examination. In the latter instance, the lever which 
  is kept pressed down to prevent explosion after the removal of the pin, had 
  come off, and was found separately with EPDP written on it! The army disposal 
  men said why the grenades did not explode is a mystery. </span></p>
<p><b><span lang=EN-GB>Lingasamy Devaraja</span></b><span lang=EN-GB>, a former

  in the Nugegoda area near Colombo, with his wife and young son. The killers 
  who shot him at close range escaped in a trishaw. The number of Tamil army personnel 
  killed during the MoU is placed at about 15.</span></p>

  on 21<sup>st</sup> April and two into the premises of the EPRLF(V) office on

'></span></h3>
<p>The silence [of progressive elements of civil society] over these killings 
  has stemmed from a mistaken notion of democracy and peace building. Many former 
  Tamil militant groups opposed to the LTTE share its history of human rights 
  abuse. Tamil politics of the 1980s was dominated by militarism, and military 
  mobilization was accomplished at the cost of political vision. Public disillusionment 
  [with these groups] followed as LTTE terror destroyed all vestiges of a people&#146;s 
  struggle. For the elite in Tamil society, appeasing the winner came instinctively 
  as a means of survival. It became fashionable to heap derogatory epithets on 
  the other militant groups. The pain, sacrifice, humiliation, rejection, and 
  the debasement that many of the LTTE&#146;s rivals suffered meant little to 
  them.</p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>But everyone is answerable for their actions, and peace can 
  become real only if, not just the Tamils, but Sri Lankans as a whole strive 
  to make all actors answerable for their misdeeds. Peace must come with justice, 
  and not by building myths around unlikely champions of peace and stubbornly 
  refusing to face the truth about where we are headed. </span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>Spearheaded by the Norwegians, the process has been based 
  on technocratic calculations of military balance [that have accepted the LTTE 
  as authentic representatives of the Tamil people and have permitted LTTE abuses 
  to continue largely unchecked]. Under the noses of the monitors, the LTTE has 
  continued to kill, to dragoon underage children for use as armed coolies, to 
  impose any form of duress on individuals and groups to prove that they have 
  the proverbial 100 % support, and to run prisons and engage in torture.</span></p>
<p>This state of affairs could not have come about without a surrender of values 
  by intellectuals and activists. Illusions of achieving an &#147;illiberal 
  peace&#148; are sustained by holding out the offer of legitimacy to forces that 
  are irreconcilably destructive, and whose ways are inherently the antithesis 
  of peace and justice. That the guns have been largely silenced is used to argue 
  that the present peace process is intrinsically feasible and, besides, the only 
  conceivable &#145;road map&#146; to peace. Those who advocate this position 
  refuse to acknowledge the growing adverse realities: the changing political 
  equation in the South, the LTTE&#146;s calculated, multi-faceted thrust against 
  any emerging Southern political consensus, and its patent cynicism in dragging 
  on the peace process for as long as convenient by making sham, rhetorical commitments 
  to human rights, democracy and a political settlement, while progressively ensuring 
  by terror on the ground that none of these stands a fighting chance. </p>
<p class=MsoBodyText align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN-GB>To these 
  guardians of intellectual rigour and the country&#146;s well being, the LTTE&#146;s

style='font-family:"Times New Roman";'>4. Paralysed by Fear &#150; Dynamics of 
  Tamil Society&#146;s Relationship to the LTTE</span></a><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman";'></span></h3>
<p>Any illusion in the North-East that peace will dawn and people can breathe 
  freely is slowly being dissipated. Facing the truth has become dangerous and 
  people who talked quite freely some months back, are beginning again to talk 
  in whispers, as though walls have ears. They take refuge behind absurd, but 
  safe, conjectures. </p>
<p>In the North the LTTE have failed to bring the people totally under their control. 
  People have shown a marked reluctance to be bulldozed into participating in 
  the LTTE&#146;s ritual gatherings. The people of the North were also traumatised 
  during the LTTE&#146;s forced exodus of 1995, and are anxious to preserve a 
  semblance of normality in their lives. Taxation and extortion demands continue, 
  but there is resistance to them. The presence of the Army and a tacit understanding 
  it has built up with the people makes it difficult for the LTTE to use terror 
  in an effective manner. </p>
<p>The LTTE controls the media and is to a degree manipulating the University, 
  using a handful of students and staff. It is making a determined bid to eliminate 
  the remaining political space for alternative voices before the next elections. 
</p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>In the East, the LTTE&#146;s ability to summon people to areas 
  under their control and impose demands on them has facilitated their control 
  of the Tamil people. They also manipulated latent anti-Muslim feelings to their 
  advantage. The effect of the MoU on places like Batticaloa, has been to make 
  people feel the presence of the LTTE in the very air they breathe. </span></p>
<p>The fate of local democratic participation is at stake. If Sivakumar's public 
  murder of Varathan in the presence of a police inspector gave the message of 
  total impunity, the murder of Jegathes and Atputharajah demolished the complacency 
  of many who hoped that they were too unimportant to become LTTE targets. Many 
  political parties have a significant base in the East. In every village there 
  are people who have associated with candidates at election time. There are hundreds 
  like Jegathes who have a party connection without being at the centre of party 
  politics. It is such persons who come forward as candidates at local council 
  elections, now the immediate focus of LTTE action. <span lang=EN-GB><a href="#_Toc39625273">[Top]</a></span></p>
<h3 style='text-align:justify'><a name="_Toc39625282"><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-family:"Times New Roman";'>4.1 Operation Tiger in Sheep&#146;s Clothing:</span></a><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'></span></h3>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>After a year of the MoU, the LTTE clearly saw that it had 
  alienated the people and had singularly failed to build a dependable electoral 
  base. Going for elections was out of the question. Its warlike rhetoric increased. 
  Its absurd claim to be sole representatives was based on the parliamentary seats 
  held by grovelling TNA members. This shaky foundation too was demolished when 
  TULF leader, Mr.Anandasangary, at a well-attended party meeting in Jaffna, on 
  23<sup>rd</sup> March, asserted the independent, separate identity of his party, 
  adding that the LTTE or anyone else cannot be the sole representatives of the 
  Tamil people in a multi-party arena. This was something the audience was longing 
  to hear. They applauded enthusiastically and mobbed their leader. In a party 
  where the LTTE had killed over 10 leaders since 1988, other MPs became nervous. 
  They criticized Anandasangary for saying openly what they too accepted, but 
  thought wise to leave unsaid.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>Not only had Mr. Anandasangary obtained the highest preference 
  vote in Jaffna at the last elections, but was also the one to have benefited 
  least from the massive LTTE-sponsored impersonation. The LTTE leaders were livid. 
  Thamilchelvan, the LTTE&#146;s political chief, who summoned TULF MPs for a 
  meeting on 19<sup>th</sup> April, ordered them to get rid of Anandasangary as 
  leader. He told them that the LTTE would then use the TULF as their political 
  front and that they would have to accept some of their nominees. The following 
  day Mavai Senathirajah MP summoned a meeting at the TULF&#146;s Stanley Road 
  office in Jaffna, a place he had previously avoided, and began the process of 
  undermining his absent leader.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>The meeting was ostensibly to organise the May Day rally, 
  a task the LTTE had entrusted to Senathirajah after the LTTE&#146;s abysmal 
  failure to attract crowds for its functions &#150; its recent Annai Poopathy 
  meetings in Batticaloa attracting no more than a few hundreds. Senathirajah 
  told the party meeting that the TULF is the political front of the Tamil struggle, 
  while the LTTE is the military front. He added that the current negotiations 
  might fail and war may follow (- the next day LTTE spokesman Anton Balasingam 
  announced in a letter to the Prime Minister the LTTE&#146;s temporary withdrawal 
  from peace talks). In the event of war, Senathirajah told the audience, the 
  TULF would be fully behind the LTTE.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>This was contrary to Anandasangary&#146;s position that the 
  TULF backs the LTTE as Tamil representatives tasked with negotiating a political 
  settlement, and for that purpose alone. Senathirajah&#146;s extrapolations had 
  no basis in party decisions. The audience that had excitedly applauded Anandasangary 
  less than a month earlier remained silent &#150; walls have ears. Raviraj MP, 
  who is close to Anandasangary, took refuge in inanities, attacking UNP minister 
  Maheswaran.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>The LTTE&#146;s two-fold strategy to cover their lack of popular 
  appeal is thus manifest. One is to take over the TULF, kill off any independent 
  life left in it, while using remaining old faces in the party as mere useful 
  props, and to use the TULF cover as a sheepskin. The second is to expedite the 
  extinction of the Tamil parties opposed to them through terror and murder.<a href="#_Toc39625273">[Top]</a></span></p>
<h3 style='text-align:justify'><a name="_Toc39625283"><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-family:"Times New Roman";'>4.2.The Third Party Syndrome: Anything 
  Goes</span></a><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;'></span></h3>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>Whatever crime the LTTE commits, all it needs to do is to 
  make a simple denial. Starting with the Government and the SLMM, the main actors 
  in the peace process will come forward to cover up for it and even to reward 
  it. The SLMM&#146;s credibility as a monitor reached a new low after the verdicts 
  it gave on the attack on the Chinese fishing vessel on 20<sup>th</sup> March 
  and the reported attack off Trincomalee on the passenger ferry carrying over 
  a thousand troops to Jaffna on 31<sup>st</sup> March. On MTV&#146;s Good Morning 
  Sri Lanka programme the following morning (April Fool&#146;s Day), SLMM spokesman 
  Teitur Torkelsson said that the LTTE denied involvement in the incident in which 
  two soldiers were injured and added that any of the &#145;other Tamil parties&#146; 
  could have carried out the attack!</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>This line of speculation became infectious. In a climate where 
  the truth was dangerous, whenever the LTTE was clearly the party to a crime, 
  people pointed to a &#145;Third Party&#146;, whether out of mischievous intention 
  or, often, simply out of fear. Violence flared up in the Mutur area in the wake 
  of protests following the abduction of two Muslim youths on 31<sup>st</sup> 
  March and the suicide of the mother of one of them on 15<sup>th</sup> April. 
  Armed LTTE cadres were seen among Tamil mobs looting, destroying, allegedly 
  poisoning wells, and, occasionally, murdering, to show, as it were, the Muslims 
  &#145;their place&#146;. About half a dozen civilians were killed. Again, pointing 
  the finger at a &#145;Third Party against the peace process&#146; became the 
  fashion among Tamil editors and commentators.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>And so members of Tamil opposition parties who dare not sip 
  a cup of tea in a boutique in Mutur or Batticaloa town, or even walk the streets 
  of Wellawatte, are being credited with deep-sea attacks off the East Coast and 
  of abductions and murders in rural, LTTE-controlled Mutur. This incredible state 
  of affairs prevails because there is no one in authority to speak the truth. 
  Instead of a robust peace process based on respect for truth, we are having 
  a directionless peace process, constantly distorting the truth to reward the 
  LTTE at any cost to the people. After the SLMM did its part to cover up for 
  the LTTE over the attack on the Chinese vessel, Thamilchelvan came close to 
  admitting LTTE involvement by saying that LTTE permission is required to sail 
  in certain waters off the island&#146;s coast. Now after more than a year of 
  the MoU and the lack of any tangible progress on a political settlement, the 
  SLMM wants to give legal form to Thamilchelvan&#146;s claim.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>There is pressure on the Government to move the Army out of 
  Jaffna town.. While the Army&#146;s presence places restrictions on normal life, 
  the people are by no means enthusiastic about moving the Army out. In the event 
  of the Army moving out, a number of traders are planning to wind up operations 
  in Jaffna, and several of them have moved substantial capital to Colombo. It 
  is an ironical comment on the half a century old Tamil struggle for self determination 
  that, without the Army (even though they do not positively safeguard them), 
  those in Jaffna who want to represent the people democratically, will face the 
  same problems faced by their counterparts in Batticaloa. Even Mr. Anandasangary 
  and his supporters will not be safe in the TULF&#146;s Stanley Road office. 
  (The TULF&#146;s former Jaffna Mayor Sivapalan had been advised by friends to 
  function from the Stanley Road TULF office near the Town Brigade HQ, and was 
  killed by the LTTE in September 1998 when he moved to the Mayor&#146;s office 
  in Nallur.) The Army must eventually move out of town, but one cannot close 
  one&#146;s eyes and pretend that restoring normality is a one-sided affair, 
  especially when political killings go unchallenged.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>Since 1990 we have from time to time provided accounts of 
  the atrocious conditions, torture and executions in the LTTE&#146;s bunker prisons, 
  based on testimonies of former inmates. We now have current testimony from an 
  escapee whose picture is in conformity with the hideous conditions we described 
  13 years ago (see Reports <a href="../Reports/Report5/Report5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>,<a href="../Reports/Report6/Report6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>,<a href="../Reports/Report8/Report8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>,<a href="../Reports/Report9/Report9.htm" target="_blank">9</a> 
  and <a href="../Reports/Report10/Report10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>). </span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>Meanwhile foreign visitors have been fobbed off with descriptions 
  of LTTE legal proceedings, a view of their more passable detention centres, 
  and humble appeals for their advice in bringing these up to international standards! 
  What kind of normality do these bunker prisons represent? It also raises questions 
  about how serious the monitoring arrangements are, and what civilians in the 
  Vanni have to put up with.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>The nations that have pushed this peace process on with extravagant 
  praise, must pause and reflect on where this is going. Do democracy and truth 
  feature anywhere in it? If they truly believe that a totalitarian peace is the 
  only answer, then they should draw up plans to provide political asylum to members 
  of Tamil opposition parties. The supporters and dependents of these parties, 
  far from thinking of elections, are terrified by the recent upsurge of killings 
  and are desperate for help. It is inhuman to pretend that there will be some 
  leeway for democracy and human rights worth fighting for, and watch while these 
  vulnerable persons get picked off one by one. This pretence is essential to 
  sell the process as a noble endeavour worthy of support.<a href="#_Toc39625273">[Top]</a></span></p>
<h3 style='text-align:justify'><a name="_Toc39625284"><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-family:"Times New Roman";'>5. The Importance of Broader Political 
  and Moral Objectives</span></a><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-family:"Times New Roman";'></span></h3>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>The current violence in Mutur, the second outbreak in less 
  than a year, underlines the inherent fragility of the peace process. If support 
  is given to the LTTE&#146;s totalitarian agenda in the name of peace, the Muslims 
  may be driven out of the East as they were driven from the North in 1990. Given 
  the nature of the LTTE, it would logically come to that, even though most Muslim 
  leaders try hard not to offend the LTTE and are remarkably flexible and accommodative. 
  When confronted with this crazy and obdurate approach to the Muslims, peacemakers 
  frequently choose to escape from reality by inventing the &#145;Third Force&#146;, 
  with an interesting list of candidates. Thus misrepresenting the problem, they 
  lose all ability to build bridges between the communities, if they ever thought 
  that necessary.<span style='background:aqua;'></span></span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>Lacking a grasp of real problems, conflict resolutionists 
  dazzle us with new jargon such as &#145;Human Security&#146; and seminars on 
  it. But the insecurity of whole families on the ground resulting from child 
  conscription, political killings and suppression of their grief, remains far 
  from their ken. Their real interest in individuals is confined to sleazy types 
  who offer contact with the LTTE. The intellectual roots of the current peace 
  process have close links to other bizarre attempts at conflict resolution such 
  as the Lome Peace Agreement in Sierra Leone of 7<sup>th</sup> July 1999. A criminal 
  organization, The Revolutionary United Front (RUF), was placed in power by starry-eyed 
  conflict resolution experts and even a manifesto was drawn up for it. Things 
  went out of control, and it took a contingent of British troops to intervene 
  and restore order. </span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB style='color:black;'>The world is moving in two diametrically 
  opposed directions. There is on the one hand a trend to bring to bear international 
  norms of order and justice, along with institutions to give them force. This 
  is essential to check the obduracy of governments and the rising tendency for 
  obscurantism and terror in the name of fighting for the rights of aggrieved 
  groups. On the other hand powerful nations led by the US are contriving their 
  own hierarchies of power and patronage with complete disregard for international 
  law and norms. In this they undermine the sway and credibility of international 
  institutions to secure their short-term economical and political objectives. 
  </span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB style='color:black;'>Unfortunately in Sri Lanka, the tendency 
  among leading political actors is to tackle the present crisis by relying solely 
  on tactical alliances with big powers. They are largely blind to the necessity 
  of committing themselves to broader political and moral objectives based on 
  international norms. They seek to remain in their political ghettoes manoeuvring 
  to safeguard their turf. The present government appears to hope that its tolerance 
  of anarchy, and opportunistic disregard for the life and rights of Tamils and 
  Muslims on the margins, would be rewarded by some big power intervening in its 
  interests. These excursions into fantasyland will boomerang on every one of 
  us in this country.</span></p>
<ul type=disc>
  <li style='color:black;text-align:justify;     '><span lang=EN-GB>The essential 
    first step is for the Sri Lankan government to place its commitment to democracy 
    and human rights on a solid footing by, as early as possible, signing and 
    ratifying the Rome Statute of the <b>International Criminal Court</b>, and 
    so give a message to the world that the Sri Lankan government will abide by 
    rule of law and no one, whether from the arms of the state or individuals, 
    will be allowed to get way with </span><span
     lang=EN-GB style='color:windowtext;'>crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity 
    and war crimes</span><span lang=EN-GB></span></li>
</ul>
<ul type=disc>
  <li style='color:black;text-align:justify;     '>Secondly, we must demand collectively 
    that rather than misuse third party mediation to further its totalitarian 
    objectives, the LTTE should negotiate a settlement for the well-being of the 
    ordinary long-suffering Tamils, who must live and die in this country, with 
    due respect for the rights and dignity of all other communities. We in this 
    country have the necessary intellectual resources to formulate a political 
    framework suited for our needs. Unfortunately, when people are sent on world 
    tours to study models, it gives the impression of a lack of seriousness. Ironically, 
    it fell to LTTE spokesman Anton Balasingam, recently, to commend publicly 
    the constitutional proposals drawn up in 1995 by suicide bomber victim Neelan 
    Tiruchelvam, with Prof. G.L. Peiris! </li>
</ul>
<p><span lang=EN-GB style='color:black;'>The International Community should not 
  waste this opportunity for peace by, on the one hand, being blind to the LTTE&#146;s 
  systematic killings and lending legitimacy to its totalitarian agenda, and, 
  on the other, giving support to the Government&#146;s manipulative and unprincipled 
  approach to peace. The failure to address core political issues should not be 
  postponed any longer. The LTTE has been allowed to use the &#145;need to restore 
  normalcy&#146; as a cover for its refusal to address these. In real terms, this 
  one-sided normalcy means tightening of the LTTE&#146;s stranglehold on the Tamil 
  people. Correspondingly, there has been little pressure on the Southern political 
  formations to put their house in order and to talk about a framework in earnest. 
  Under such circumstances, any developmental activity would be pointless and 
  wasteful, if not disastrous.</span><span lang=EN-GB><a href="#_Toc39625273">[Top]</a></span></p>
