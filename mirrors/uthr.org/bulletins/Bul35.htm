  <p align="center"><b>Summary</b></p>
  <p><i>The recent split in the LTTE has opened up that organization to unprecedented 
    scrutiny. The press is full of speculation about what Batticaloa/Amparai leader 
    Karuna's breakaway means for the elections, for continuation of the ceasefire 
    and for a political solution. It is certain to complicate all three. Very 
    little has been said about what it means in the immediate or longer term for 
    the Tamil people. </i></p>
  <p><i>This new bulletin by the University Teachers for Human Rights (Jaffna) 
    examines how the LTTE has used terror to redefine the political landscape 
    and its effects on Tamil society.</i></p>
  <p><i>The elections in Sri Lanka are fast approaching. Already a Tamil candidate 
    and a party activist who failed to toe the LTTE line have been killed; still 
    others have dropped out under threat of violence. Who is next? And how many 
    others who might have contested were eliminated long before these snap polls 
    were announced? UTHR(J) wonders how any election could be considered free 
    and fair in such an environment. </i></p>
  <p><i>UTHR(J) describes both clear cases of political violence aimed at silencing 
    electoral challenges to the LTTE's claim to be the Tamil people's &quot;sole 
    representative,&quot; as well as details of its ongoing campaign to root other 
    less obvious challenges to LTTE authority. The bulletin provides details of 
    four political abductions prior to the closing of nominations, fourteen murders, 
    including the brutal murders of families with children, and assassinations 
    of political opponents. </i></p>
  <p><i>Karuna's recent statements confirm what everyone already knew about the 
    most recent killings in the East: the LTTE ordered them. The SLMM must now 
    treat them as cease-fire violations and demand an explanation from the LTTE 
    rather than pretend that the killings pertain to criminal activities outside 
    their mandate. </i></p>
  <p><i>In mid-January, at the height of a series of LTTE murders, representatives 
    of Sri Lanka's donor nations met with LTTE leaders in Killinochchi to discuss 
    development assistance to the north and east. This came in response to the 
    LTTE's demand that funding be sent directly to the region, rather than through 
    the Sri Lankan Government. UTHR(J) expresses deep alarm at the notion that 
    the international community would even consider providing the LTTE or its 
    proxies with direct access to development funds in such an undemocratic and 
    violent context.</i></p>
  <p><i>Sri Lanka's donors have encouraged the LTTE's expansion under the misguided 
    premise that the group could be eased into a democratic process; and they 
    have failed to take responsibility for the abuse that has occurred as a result. 
    Statements encouraging free and fair elections are insufficient. They must 
    be backed up by clear policies that condition any future involvement in Sri 
    Lanka on an end to political violence and repression.</i></p>
  <p><i>Fissures in the LTTE's monopolistic hold on power may offer opportunities 
    as well as the threat of renewed violence. Now that the LTTE's murder campaign 
    in the East is out in the open, it is time to renew demands for democratic 
    safeguards, as well as the release of child conscripts who could fall victim 
    to internecine violence. An acknowledgement in the East on these issues could 
    have positive repercussions in the North as well.</i></p>
  <p><a name="charade"></a><b>1. The Charade Comes Apart</b></p>
  <p>The current split in the LTTE illustrates how fragile the enterprise has 
    always been -- something Tamil dissidents had long talked about. This belief 
    was largely dismissed by others who were overwhelmed by its apparent success. 
    The dissidents, thousands of whom paid with their life for the right to question 
    the authority of LTTE, maintained that the LTTE's huge oppressive structure, 
    constantly gearing for war and superimposed on a political and moral vacuum, 
    would finally nullify all the sacrifices made. It would leave the Tamil people 
    in a far worse plight than they had begun with.</p>
  <p>Ironically, Karuna himself raised some of these issues in a convoluted way 
    in his letter to Prabhakaran of 2nd March and in the subsequent leaflet. He 
    said that the East has seen nothing but misery and economic ruin and the parents 
    will no longer tolerate Eastern cadres being exported to the North for menial 
    duties where they are given no modern skills or opportunities for advancement.</p>
  <p>The inertia of hubris, however, condemned the LTTE to this fatal course. 
    Had Prabhakaran wanted to pursue a peace process towards a political settlement, 
    he could have succeeded wonderfully as far back as 1987. Readers of our reports 
    over the last three years would see clearly that at the root of the split 
    with Karuna lies the LTTE's pursuit of preparations for war and child conscription 
    (Karuna himself a leader in this) under the trappings of a peace process. 
    For the people it was unbearable misery that made no sense. </p>
  <p>The Tamil separatist struggle has led to a host of ironies. The Government 
    certainly has far less control over the North-East than it once did, while 
    the people who once voted for separation largely as a mark of protest against 
    state-sponsored ethnic discrimination and persecution, are far from enchanted 
    with that prospect today. Indeed, while the North-East has been depleted of 
    human and economic potential, Colombo has acquired a thriving Tamil community 
    - people driven from their homes by violent conflict and economic ruin who 
    have established lives in the capital. Separatist dreams of a prosperous North-East 
    have sunk in a slime of economic stagnation and political monopoly - enforced 
    through murder, child conscription and extortion. </p>
  <p>The drive towards separation no longer comes from the people of the North-East, 
    but from the perversity of Southern politics and the carelessness of the International 
    Community. At some point, the Southern polity's inability to offer a political 
    solution for decades, tipped over into abject appeasement of the LTTE. Now 
    the tragic reality in the North-East has vanished altogether from political 
    exchanges in the South. From this quarter there is no message of hope, only 
    one of dread. </p>
  <p>The Western donor community's press release from Washington on 17th February, 
    reflected apparent satisfaction that the LTTE had not resorted to war and 
    reiterated the need to advance rehabilitation of the North-East. While it 
    referred to the Tokyo declaration (which contained language on human rights 
    and democracy), it made no direct mention of Sri Lanka's deteriorating human 
    rights situation or the LTTE's gruesome parody of the principle of democratic 
    choice.</p>
  <p>Reality must be faced: a commitment to reconstruction, in effect under the 
    LTTE, without reference to its utter disregard for human rights enshrined 
    in that declaration, gives a clear message that donors are not serious about 
    ensuring Sri Lanka's democratic survival. </p>
  <p>At the height of a series of murders by the LTTE described below, representatives 
    from many prominent donor nations conferred with LTTE leaders in Killinochchi 
    on 19th January. TamilNet quoted a European diplomat saying that the meeting 
    was to &quot;maximise and reactivate the development program in the northeast.&quot; 
    What cynical folly! A similar attitude has been expressed by UNICEF and the 
    SLMM. The SLMM chief told the BBC Tamil Service on 22nd February that violations 
    of the ceasefire agreement by the LTTE though taken seriously by them, do 
    not at all affect the 'peace' process adversely. This is not only disingenuous, 
    it is terribly dangerous.</p>
  <p>Thus the rights of the people in the North-East, never a priority anyway 
    in Southern politics, have become a non-issue in the election campaign. The 
    argument is mainly between those who advocate appeasement of the LTTE to win 
    the confidence of the donors, and those who had always equated devolution 
    to the North-East with giving the Tamil &quot;menace&quot; a foothold for 
    conquest of the whole island. Between these two apparent extremes they make 
    the case for separation in a manner unequalled by the separatists themselves. 
    Meanwhile the people of the North-East have been abandoned to the Tigers' 
    grip. Their gruesome reality goes largely unnoticed. The terror is more insidious 
    by being veiled.</p>
  <p>Karuna's rebellion against the LTTE poses crucial challenges running against 
    the grain of Southern politics and the agenda of the peacemakers. For several 
    months LTTE hegemony in the East has been widely resented. But the LTTE's 
    quasi-legal move in the wake of the rebellion to appoint a new leadership 
    to take control of the East, its diplomatic moves through Norway and the Sri 
    Lankan government's publicly stated stand-off policy, suggest that the hated 
    LTTE hegemony may be imposed on the East once again. The prospect of another 
    bloodbath like the LTTE's massacre of TELO cadres in 1986, who were again 
    largely Easterners, needs to be taken seriously.</p>
  <p>Peacemakers may no longer see in Karuna a potent threat. He may be viewed 
    as a pawn with which to make deals with the Northern LTTE leadership, the 
    appeasement of whom is the cornerstone of the peace process. In the past the 
    Southern polity has watched with indifference or glee whenever Tamils killed 
    Tamils or Tamils killed Muslims. It served as a veil to hide its own stupendous 
    crimes and, in the long run hopefully, aid the Sinhalese chauvinist agenda. 
    Such an attitude also fatally diminished the value of Sri Lankan sovereignty, 
    when it offered nothing to the people of the North-East. It amounted to a 
    failure of statesmanship. This should not happen again. </p>
  <p>There may be valid legal constraints pertaining to the cease-fire in dealing 
    with the present crisis. But that cannot be an excuse for a stand-off policy 
    in the event of an approaching bloodbath. The case should first be made loud 
    and clear to constrain the LTTE leadership. </p>
  <p>The LTTE's conduct in the context of the election campaign is an outcome 
    of their being pampered and flattered to a point where they believe they can 
    get away with anything. <a href="#top">[TOP]</a></p>
  <p><b><a name="murders"></a>2. Murders of a candidate and activist and the Karuna 
    Crisis</b></p>
  <p>At 1.30 AM on 29th February LTTE men broke into the house retired school 
    principal and UNP candidate Sinnathamby Sunderampillai (63) of Araiampathy, 
    Batticaloa, and shot him, injuring him in the hand. Warded at Batticaloa Hospital, 
    he told the Press that the attackers were the LTTE and the previous time he 
    contested as a candidate of the New Left Front, the LTTE had detained him 
    for several weeks. The following morning, 1st March, at 5.00 AM, he was shot 
    dead by LTTE men who entered the hospital.</p>
  <p>The same day at 10.30 PM, LTTE men shot dead Ponniah Yoganathan (25), a party 
    worker for the EPDP, and father of two children, near his home in Valaichenai. 
    Commentators were quick to associate Sunderampillai's murder with LTTE political 
    leader Tamil Chelvan's statement published in the Uthayan of 16th February 
    upon rushing back from London after consulting LTTE spokesman Anton Balasingam. 
    He said that 'Majoritarian' parties (those from the South) would not be permitted 
    to contest in the North-East, which he later denied for international consumption.</p>
  <p>The attack on Sunderampillai at his home may have been to intimidate rather 
    than kill him. But matters became more serious when Sunderampillai named the 
    LTTE, which is very sensitive to legal evidence. Without such evidence the 
    LTTE simply denies and the donors and SLMM monitors happily play along. Whether 
    the decision to kill Sunderampillai was taken locally or ordered from the 
    North, it was consistent with LTTE policy.</p>
  <p>The murder of Yoganathan was probably a local decision, but may have come 
    as one too many at a time the media was focusing on the LTTE's determination 
    to steal the election and the US condemning its behaviour. Karuna, the LTTE's 
    Eastern Commander, has an obsession with stamping out any sign of opposition 
    in Valaichenai, his home area (see Sp. Rep. No 14). </p>
  <p>The present EPDP candidate for the area is Siva, who, with Yoganathan, was 
    in the EPRLF until a few weeks ago. At the 2001 elections Siva, a relative 
    of the murdered TULF MP Nimalan Soundaranayagam, polled more than 4,000 votes 
    as an EPRLF candidate. (The EPDP built itself up in Batticaloa almost entirely 
    by taking over persons from the EPRLF, which was having financial difficulties.) 
    This time, with the TULF in complete disarray, Siva stood to poll a larger 
    number of votes. Killing Yoganathan was again aimed at curbing Siva's ability 
    to campaign.</p>
  <p>The LTTE hierarchy would have felt the pressure from the publicity attached 
    to these two killings and there must have been exchanges exacerbating already 
    existing tensions between Karuna and his detractors in the group. On 3rd March, 
    at 10.00 PM (local time), the Associated Press reported the story that there 
    was a rift between Karuna and the Northern leadership. It was our assessment 
    (Sp. Rep. 14) that such a rift would not easily take place. Karuna was wholly 
    dependent on support from the global LTTE network, and he cannot go his own 
    way unless some other government or mafia backed him and he survives the secret 
    agents placed around him. </p>
  <p>Predictably, two hours later, just after midnight, on the 4th, TamilNet tried 
    to refute the AP story. TamilNet said quoting Karuna that he would 'take orders 
    directly from the leader of the LTTE in future'. It now turns out that TamilNet 
    was for a change slow on the news and was quoting Karuna selectively from 
    a long letter he had had addressed to Prabhakaran on 2nd March, the day after 
    the killings. Karuna's letter stated that he had stopped the functioning of 
    the Intelligence Wing. An indication that the murders also featured in the 
    crisis came in a leaflet distributed by Karuna in Batticaloa on the 4th, where 
    he conveniently attributed the killings and vehicle thefts in Batticaloa to 
    the Intelligence Wing, an accusation not contained in his letter to the Leader 
    two days earlier. </p>
  <p>Karuna's main demand in the letter was that he should function autonomously. 
    By taking orders directly from the LTTE leader, Karuna actually meant that 
    other LTTE structures under the Leader should not function in his area except 
    through his own appointees. This was something the Leader could not agree 
    to. The way he kept a grip on the organization was to split functions under 
    his appointees, positioning them so that they watched and informed on each 
    other and he could move against an individual at short notice.</p>
  <p>The 2nd March had been a day of crisis (a word finally used by Tamil Chelvan 
    and quoted by TamilNet on the 4th). According to some sources Karuna was tipped 
    off that a group in the Intelligence Wing was ordered to bring him to the 
    Vanni and he moved first. His letter to the Leader must have reached him the 
    same day. At 10.30 PM that night, 2nd, some elite groups of the LTTE, including 
    the Charles Anthony Brigade, moved to surround, disarm and then confine to 
    barracks the Jeyanthan Division from Batticaloa that was posted southeast 
    of the military lines in Thenmaratchy, Jaffna. We will take up the political 
    dimension of these events below. But first, we will examine some less publicized 
    killings by the people's 'sole representatives' to which Karuna made reference. 
    These have assumed an elusively barbarous quality. <a href="#top">[TOP]</a></p>
  <p><b><a name="sword"></a>3. The Sword of the Sole-Representatives </b></p>
  <p>The reality in the North-East is typically exemplified in the murder about 
    14th January of a young couple and their infant child: Nathan Suthakaran (38), 
    his wife Swarnawathy (29) and their 8-month-old child Vathanan. Their bodies 
    were found on the 16th with their throats cut. </p>
  <p>The family had moved into Kanagampuliyady in the Thenmaratchy Division a 
    few months earlier after having been displaced to Puttur. Kanagampuliyady, 
    which had an army-presence since 1996, had been declared a high security zone. 
    The area also had constant LTTE movement. </p>
  <p>WhenUTHR(J) began to investigate the murder of the family we found silence 
    everywhere. The Government, given its own record, found it prudent not to 
    'provoke' the LTTE, the international community did not want to rock the boat, 
    and there were no eyewitnesses except perhaps the killers themselves. </p>
  <p>Yet as we have verified from a number of sources, the people in the area 
    blamed the LTTE for the murder of the family. A deliberate indication was 
    given by the LTTE's Thenmaratchy political commissar Sivanath, who visited 
    the area five days later, on the evening of 19th January. He suggested that 
    the family met its fate because it had contact with the Army.</p>
  <p>Reading between the Lines</p>
  <p>People have always been more willing to talk about abuses by state forces 
    than LTTE killings. In many crimes by the Army over the years, there has been 
    forensic evidence, eyewitnesses' testimony or an ex-detainee pointing to the 
    source, as our reports suggest. Evidence of this kind is relatively rare in 
    the case of crimes by the LTTE. The Tamil community is, very simply, not a 
    safe place to talk openly of the LTTE.</p>
  <p>But there is another kind of evidence that is usually plentiful in crimes 
    by the LTTE. This is psychological evidence. Take the case above: By examining 
    what has been said and NOT said about the case in the Tamil media we suddenly 
    get a much clearer picture of the LTTE's role as the killer. </p>
  <p>The archives of TamilNet contain detailed and photographic coverage of crimes 
    committed by state forces, contrasting sharply with the single evasive piece 
    of 16th January on the horrific event in Kanagampuliady. It said: &quot;The 
    couple's home is in an isolated spot surrounded by a large number of Sri Lankan 
    military positions and camps. The Police said the family may have been murdered 
    3 days ago. Their throats were slit.&quot; <br>
    We have verified that the TamilNet report is misleading. The nearest army 
    presence to the home of the murdered family is a sentry point, rather than 
    a camp, 300 yards away. The family was also not isolated - others lived nearby.</p>
  <p>'The Virakesari' on the Murder</p>
  <p>The piece by a writer calling himself R. Pushpaparan in the Sunday Virakesari 
    of 1st February 2004 titled 'Continuing Mysterious Deaths in the Jaffna Peninsula' 
    was a real giveaway. The writer, as the contents indicated, wrote under instructions 
    from the LTTE, pushing the formula of LTTE spokesmen: &quot;These crimes are 
    taking place in the few areas densely populated by the armed forces, while 
    law and order prevail in areas under LTTE control.&quot; </p>
  <p>Pushpaparan's piece two weeks after the event was clearly an attempt to refute 
    widespread talk that the LTTE was responsible for killing the family with 
    the infant.<br>
    In contrast to the local LTTE commissar's hint that Suthakaran was a traitor 
    for maintaining contact with the Army, Pushpaparan projected him as a man 
    who was well regarded locally. He also veered away from the TamilNet claim 
    that the family lived in an isolated area, saying that they lived along the 
    Manthuvil-Puttur Road where there was regular movement and other dwellings 
    nearby. The writer indicatively expressed surprise that the murder remained 
    concealed for two days. He helpfully pointed to the killers being expert and 
    on a deliberate mission: a cut on the neck of each victim and another on the 
    head - what locals call a 'clean job'. </p>
  <p>The writer then came to the main point of his piece. He said that the dead 
    mother Swarnawathy's underskirt had been lifted above a leg and went on to 
    suggest rape as the motive for the subsequent murder. Pushpaparan them flays 
    the Sri Lankan Police for not making progress in their investigation and failing 
    to make arrests. He commends the Tiger Police for their efficacy in combating 
    crime in their area and assures us that the LTTE is investigating the spate 
    of mysterious killings in Jaffna that are being used to tarnish their name. 
    He warns the Sri Lankan Police that they would face dire consequences if by 
    continuing to be ineffective they force the people to take the law into their 
    own hands! </p>
  <p>Readers may recall that the LTTE also promised to investigate the 'mysterious' 
    attacks on the Hartley College Principal in September 2002 (Sp. Rep. 15) and 
    the murder in April 2003 of Maclan Atputharajah (Bulletin 32). The families 
    are still waiting.</p>
  <p>No evidence of rape: Pushpaparan's suggestion of rape by the Army was clearly 
    an afterthought, which did not feature in earlier reports, the magistrate's 
    inquest or the inquest in Jaffna Hospital. This time, in contrast to the Tigers' 
    normal practice of flooding the world with pictures of crimes by the Army, 
    there was constant evasion. No pictures appeared in the Tamil media. When 
    the bodies of the victims were brought to hospital, the Tigers were there 
    and forcefully dissuaded reporters from taking photographs. The photographs 
    that were relayed on the Internet had been taken secretly, despite the Tigers.</p>
  <p>Other evasions and facts given by Pushpaparan give us the true picture. The 
    neighbours almost certainly knew about the murder and who had done it. The 
    LTTE knew what the people knew and this was the context of the area leader's 
    words. Indeed, the LTTE is far more intimately present in these areas than 
    the alien Army. The belief among the people was determined not by this incident 
    alone, but by a series of murders that pointed to the LTTE.</p>
  <p>A series of murders:</p>
  <p>Three or four days earlier, on 10th January, a 25 year old youth later identified 
    as Suntharalingam Vinothan was brought by van to a lonely paddy field in Madduvil, 
    very close to Kanagampuliyady, shot in the back of his head and dumped. His 
    services had been secured to transport 12 computers to Jaffna from Colombo. 
    The Hartley College web site suggests that the deceased was an engineering 
    graduate from South Bank University, London, who returned to this country 
    recently. From records of vehicles entering and leaving the Jaffna peninsula, 
    the Police have deduced that the vehicle in which Vinothan brought the computers 
    to Jaffna had left Jaffna for the LTTE controlled Vanni with a false number 
    plate shortly afterwards.</p>
  <p>Although what exactly was behind the murder is not known, the public had 
    little doubt that it was the LTTE. Since no proper motive has been attributed 
    to the murder of Suthaharan and his family, it raises the question whether 
    one of them had seen too much in the murder of Vinothan. A peculiarity of 
    the Ceasefire is that the LTTE is sensitive to legal evidence of its crimes.</p>
  <p>People in Thenmaratchy were quick to link the murders of the four persons. 
    They were also reminded of the murder of Maclan Atputharajah from that area 
    on 23rd April 2003. Atputharajah was a popular figure from that area tipped 
    to contest elections on an EPRLF (V) ticket. Section 2.4 of our Bulletin No 
    32 of 2nd May 2003 gave strong evidence that left little doubt about the LTTE 
    being the killers. <a href="#top">[TOP]</a></p>
  <p><b><a name="law"></a>4. Law enforcement by the LTTE</b></p>
  <p>To be clear about their purpose, we will examine Pushpaparan's claim that 
    the LTTE is investigating these crimes independently to protect its good name 
    and that the LTTE police is very effective in bringing criminals to justice 
    in their area. On the contrary, , we find that most victims in the LTTE's 
    area simply disappear, whether victims of murder or child conscripts. </p>
  <p>Girl Beheaded</p>
  <p>A gruesome exception was the young seamstress Miss Princy Ratnasingam (19) 
    who lived in 234 Hudson Street, Vattakachchi and a native of Urumpirai in 
    Jaffna. Her severed head, identity card and hand bag were found close to Surveyor 
    Shop in Kanthan Kulam (Tank) in Killinochi near the LTTE's administrative 
    capital. An excruciating stink caused the people to search for the balance 
    of her remains, which were found in shrubs near the tank. The incident was 
    reported in the Eelanadu of 27th December 2003 and, since then, shrouded in 
    silence. It is believed that the LTTE suspected her of links with Tamil opposition 
    groups and, by their action, conveyed a strong message locally while keeping 
    the option of denial at a distance.</p>
  <p>The Murder of the Co-op Manager in Vaharai</p>
  <p>Vannamani Sabaratnam (57) was the general manager of the Cooperative Society 
    in the LTTE-controlled area of Vaharai north of Batticaloa. A father of 5 
    children, 3 boys and 2 girls, he had long standing problems with the LTTE. 
    Having taken over the distribution of government supplies and rations, the 
    LTTE often substituted inferior rice priced higher. The people complained 
    to Sabaratnam and Sabaratnam complained to the LTTE. On 19th December 2003, 
    he was arrested by Kalaivannan of LTTE-intelligence and taken to their main 
    base in Tharavai.</p>
  <p>The LTTE demanded a large sum of money from him, running into several lakhs 
    of rupees, according to sources close to him. Sabaratnam said that he did 
    not have the money. He was then asked to aid the LTTE to help them in various 
    rackets to transfer relief and resources from the people to LTTE coffers. 
    These include buying rice for distribution from mills nominated by the LTTE 
    and giving them a cut on rations for refugees. Upon his refusal, the LTTE 
    demanded a son from him. When he again refused, he was beaten and killed as 
    his wife Saroja later discovered.</p>
  <p>The Rape and Murder in Eravur</p>
  <p>Miss. Nishanthini Shanthalingam (17) of the Eravur Tamil Division went to 
    worship at the Kali temple in the evening of 19th December 2003 and failed 
    to return home. Three days later, on the 22nd, her body was discovered in 
    a well close to the border with the Muslim Division. Tensions rose amid speculation 
    that the deed was done by Muslims. However the speculation was put to rest 
    when Nishanthini's parents made energetic inquiries and identified one of 
    the culprits as the Tamil youth Yogarajah Antony (22). According to local 
    sources there were other accomplices to the crime, which is said to have included 
    gang rape.</p>
  <p>Antony had been in the LTTE for 4 years, and then, from home, worked under 
    the direction of Brindha Master, the local LTTE intelligence chief. The Police 
    then moved to arrest Antony. On hearing about it, the LTTE themselves took 
    Antony to their area and blocked the arrest, giving the impression that they 
    would punish him themselves. This episode and the near occurrence of a Muslim-Tamil 
    clash leaves many questions unanswered.</p>
  <p>The cases above give us a good idea of how the LTTE and their Police enforce 
    the law and point to the limitations of the Sri Lankan Police.</p>
  <p>The Sri Lankan Police in the North-East: &quot;Thou shalt not provoke&quot;</p>
  <p>The Sri Lankan Police are far from being the world's best law enforcement 
    agency. Political interference in the Police is routine in the South. In the 
    North-East, the peace process has left them further demoralized without a 
    shred of dignity. After much protest in the South the Police arrested Subaraj 
    (Sathyan) in June 2003 for murdering Navasooriyan of Army Intelligence. The 
    LTTE then abducted two policemen. In a deal brokered in part by the SLMM, 
    Satyan was granted bail in return for the release of the two policemen (see 
    Special Report 17). Satyan has about 10 known murders to his credit. Since 
    then the police have almost routinely covered up for the LTTE. </p>
  <p>In Bulletin No.33, we dealt with the LTTE's murder of several Muslims near 
    Kinniya including the brutal slaying of 3 Muslim farmers in Naduootru on 29th 
    November 2003. As in the Kanagampuliyady murders, the instrument used was 
    the now ubiquitous sword. Senior police officials went to ridiculous lengths 
    to shield the LTTE.</p>
  <p>In Special report No 17 we gave the case of Sathyan and Mathan of the LTTE 
    who by broad daylight attacked and killed Navaneethan, a labourer and former 
    member of the EPRLF in Batticaloa Town. No arrest was made. The situation 
    of the people is so pathetic that the LTTE and its agents can blissfully have 
    it both ways. Now they are accusing the Sri Lankan Police of not making any 
    progress in the utterly gruesome Kanagampuliyady murders. How could they? 
    The North-East has been virtually handed over to the LTTE, courtesy of the 
    Sri Lankan Government, Norway and our 'International Community.' How can we 
    talk about monitoring elections? What elections? <a href="#top">[TOP]</a></p>
  <p><b><a name="elections"></a>5. The LTTE's Independent Elections Commission 
    at Work</b></p>
  <p>In his piece in the Daily Mirror of 11th February, the editor of the TamilNet 
    sounded very piqued that people spoke of the Tamil National Alliance as a 
    creature of the LTTE. This, to him, was belittling the civil society organizations 
    and the Tamil Media, in where he was a key figure, which stitched the quarrelsome 
    parties together. They shepherded this bunch, described by him as more inclined 
    'to run with the hare and hunt with the hounds'. A few days later he was forced 
    to swallow his words - once more demonstrating that it is unwise for those 
    who run with the LTTE to be burdened with a heavy ego.</p>
  <p>At a press conference in Killinochi on 17th February given at the close of 
    a meeting to finalise the TNA's list of candidates LTTE spokesman Tamil Chelvan 
    made it abundantly clear that the TNA was not merely their creature, but was 
    the LTTE itself. TamilNet promptly reporting on that meeting quoted Tamil 
    Chelvan: &quot;We unanimously decided today that the Tamil people should vote 
    only for the policies of the TNA. This is the wish of our leader and leadership. 
    The Tamils should unite under one leadership and one policy for this election&quot;. 
    Mr.Sampanthan, the key functionary of the TNA present was completely overshadowed. 
    Tamil Chelvan was indeed the de facto president of the TNA.</p>
  <p>While Tamil Chelvan was the mouthpiece, neither TamilNet nor the Virakesari 
    revealed the key (and most menacing) presence at the actual deliberations. 
    This was the LTTE's intelligence chief and principal killer Pottu Amman. Pottu's 
    experience in election work included the 'garlanding' of Rajiv Gandhi while 
    he was campaigning for the Indian elections in 1991 - that assassination had 
    major repercussions on the region's political history. His presence and his 
    role in selecting candidates would have given the other puppets present the 
    haunting message that once you caught the Tiger by the tail, you are stuck 
    to it for life.</p>
  <p>The company present at the TNA meeting had already decided 'unanimously' 
    what and whom the Tamils should vote for. The TNA policy mentioned by Tamil 
    Chelvan was the demand for the Interim Self-Governing Authority (ISGA) proposed 
    by the LTTE. The ISGA envisaged an independent elections commission for the 
    North-East. This commission was being pre-empted with Pottu Amman as effective 
    elections commissioner and general secretary of the TNA, even before the people 
    had voted for it. That vote too is a forgone conclusion. Pottu Amman is leaving 
    no stone unturned to ensure that. </p>
  <p>We outline the main strategies used by the LTTE to hijack democracy.</p>
  <p>1. Use of terror to redesign the political landscape</p>
  <p>How the calculated use of terror affects the society at its core is very 
    subtle and hard to pin down, although its wounds are very deep and septic. 
    Its effects on the parliamentary political landscape, though just the thin 
    end of the wedge are easier to discern. The political landscape in the North-East 
    was devastated by the LTTE's 'cleansing' of thousands of opponents over the 
    years. Once individuals in politics realise that trying to maintain any semblance 
    of independence from the LTTE can be fatal, it can bring about a variety of 
    reactions. Among them:</p>
  <p>&middot; The more honourable sort simply moved out of politics </p>
  <p>&middot; Many with an established vote base tried to make deals with the 
    LTTE to stay in politics. In time they became complete pawns, as with several 
    of the leading TULF members. To be charitable, one might describe it as the 
    kind of religious conversion that comes under conditions of extreme fear.</p>
  <p>&middot; Several former opponents of the LTTE whose prospects in regular 
    parliamentary politics were very dim and risky grabbed at an offer from the 
    LTTE. All had had close colleagues murdered by them. But they found that aligning 
    themselves with the LTTE was an easy road to parliamentary fame. The path 
    was made even easier by having the LTTE's terror on their side against their 
    former friends and colleagues. Among these were groups such as TELO and EPRLF 
    (Suresh Wing) or theACTC, a non-entity in parliamentary politics, which went 
    under the LTTE's umbrella and obtained two parliamentary seats in Jaffna. 
    It was all deceptively easy. </p>
  <p>Terror gave the LTTE many options to break up political parties and ultimately 
    swallow them. In 1999 Suresh Premachandran the general secretary of the EPRLF 
    (who had the party's funds) made a deal with the LTTE and summoned a central 
    committee meeting in an LTTE dominated area, where only his cronies could 
    safely attend. The party split as a result, and his opponents were financially 
    ruined.</p>
  <p>Pro-LTTE members of the TULF led by Sampanthan, Pararajasingam and Mavai 
    Senathirajah tried to repeat the trick last year in an effort to oust the 
    President Mr. Anandasangaree, having failed in two earlier attempts. Anandasangaree 
    moved quickly to get a court injunction and stop them. Having asserted his 
    independence from the LTTE in recent times, he is fielding an independent 
    list in Jaffna at great risk.</p>
  <p>The disparate elements that came under the LTTE were moulded into the Tamil 
    National Alliance just ahead of elections in 2001. But their path was not 
    paved with gold despite the regular penance of compulsory pilgrimages to HQ 
    in Killinochchi and taking oaths of fidelity and performing obeisance before 
    Prabhakaran in person or photographic proxy.</p>
  <p>For the 2004 elections, under Pottu Amman's guidance, neophytes wavering 
    in their enthusiasm were dropped from lists of candidates for the TNA, which 
    are now dominated by persons tested for their subservience to the LTTE. </p>
  <p>According to sources close to the LTTE, TELO remnants and the Suresh Faction 
    have been directly brought under Pottu Amman to function as new intelligence 
    outfits. Houses have been bought in Jaffna for these outfits and monies for 
    them are disbursed by Pottu Amman himself. According to these sources Suresh 
    Premachandran had several meetings with Pottu Amman in connection with the 
    formation of these outfits. It is thought that such outfits would be more 
    effective in gathering information on dissidents and remnants of left-leaning 
    circles close to the EPRLF.</p>
  <p>Effect on choice of candidates before the People</p>
  <p>Political parties that could challenge the LTTE have been decimated. TULF, 
    the largest party has been all but destroyed and only Anandasangaree's court 
    injunction prevented the TNA from appropriating its rising sun symbol. Original 
    TULF members are mere shadows in current TNA lists; only two in Jaffna and 
    one in Batticaloa have managed to survive. Owing to the ubiquitous presence 
    of the LTTE killer machine, some opposition groups decided not to stand for 
    election at all.</p>
  <p>A leader of an opposition group despaired, &quot;What is the meaning in our 
    putting forward a list of candidates for election, when we don't have money 
    even to pay for their funerals, leave alone care for their widows and children?&quot;</p>
  <p>Had there been some little opening for the expression of the people's will, 
    Anandasangaree (leading independently the section of the TULF commanding a 
    clear majority in the central committee and the TULF support base) would have 
    shamed the LTTE's claim to represent the Tamil people. The Batticaloa District 
    has a solid TULF base, and among the TULF supporters there is widespread disenchantment 
    with the LTTE hijacking the TULF and suffocating it within the TNA. Anandasangaree 
    had planned to field a list of candidates in Batticaloa, but had to drop the 
    idea when the candidates decided that they could not risk their life.</p>
  <p>After the TNA submitted its nominations in the Jaffna Kacheri, Political 
    Commissar Illamparathy summoned the candidates to a meeting. Ilamparithy flatteringly 
    addressed them as MPs - a prospect too good to be true. Ilamparithy put any 
    apprehensions to rest by guaranteeing their election, adding that they know 
    how to ensure it. He then delivered the bitter pill. Once they are elected 
    they must speak for Tamil Eelam.</p>
  <p>Facilitating interference in the election</p>
  <p>The state is not an innocent by-stander. To guarantee the result of the election, 
    the UNP government went a long way in giving the LTTE control over the government 
    machinery including the elections office and the Postal Department through 
    which polling cards are distributed. What's more, among the list of TNA candidates 
    for Jaffna is Gajendran, leader of the 'International Students' Organisation' 
    who played a leading role in preventing the opening of the Jaffna Public Library 
    . At the 2001 elections, he was at the lead of mobilising the students of 
    the University of Jaffna in a massive polling cards fraud. About 20 000 polling 
    cards of absentee, deceased, and displaced residents were collected and cast 
    for selected TNA candidates. This time at least Gajendran will not do the 
    donkey's work for someone else to walk away with the prize.</p>
  <p>Nevertheless the LTTE is not taking chances. The oppressor must live with 
    the fear that the worm will turn. Who imagined that a section of the TULF 
    would be driven to defy the LTTE? Besides, killing is addictive. The LTTE 
    is condemned to see real threats to their hegemony in the dim shadows of dissent 
    rather than to look within. <a href="#top">[TOP]</a></p>
  <p><b><a name="unending"></a>6. The Unending trail of murder and terror</b></p>
  <p>We began this bulletin with by examining the massacre of the family at Kanagampuliyady, 
    with other murders both obvious and mysterious, depending on how deep one 
    wishes to go, and the deception and media deceit surrounding such events. 
    These indicate the atmosphere in which elections are being held. The LTTE's 
    long and short term preparations described above hold out the promise of more 
    violence, deception and deceit to come. </p>
  <p>Incredibly, in addition to an independent elections commission, the LTTE's 
    ISGA proposals envisage an independent human rights commission. This commission 
    is now having its trial run in the statements issued by 'civil society organisations', 
    which have a curious resemblance to the line aired by TamilNet. </p>
  <p>Criminal Violence by the LTTE</p>
  <p>While violence by the LTTE used to be largely political, we have noticed 
    a significant rise in the number of reported incidents that appear to be purely 
    criminal. Some of the current victims are believed to be persons who worked 
    with the LTTE in rackets such as smuggling stolen vehicles into the Vanni 
    and now being investigated by the Police.</p>
  <p>4th January 2004: 10.00 AM: Vavuniya: Balasubramaniam Ajanthan (25) shot 
    dead by the LTTE in Pattakadu near his home. A native of Allaveddy, Jaffna, 
    the victim had resided in Vavuniya for 6 months and was then returning from 
    the temple. The food that had been ceremonially sanctified was scattered on 
    the street.</p>
  <p>4th January: 8.00PM: Vavuniya: Jeyam (27), auto driver and father of two 
    children was shot dead in Pandarikulam. The victim who hailed from Batticaloa 
    was a police constable under interdiction. </p>
  <p>13th January: Vallai: Jaffna: Sundaramoorthy Sooriyamoorthy (52) was found 
    strangled to death in the Vallai Moor, an isolated open space that has to 
    be crossed by wayfarers between Jaffna and Vadamaratchy. A native of Theeruvil, 
    Valvettithurai, the victim owned a grocery shop in Valvettithurai from where 
    the LTTE leader hails.</p>
  <p>According to local sources, Sooriyamoorthy had shown opposition to the frequent 
    stoppages and closures demanded by the LTTE. It is notable that this murder 
    took place about the same time as the Kanagampuliyady and Manthuvil murders 
    recorded earlier.</p>
  <p>17th January: Vavuniya: The body of the youth Dilip was found hanging inVaarikkuttiyar 
    after he was beaten to death. Dilip was a member of the EPDP. Dilip's father 
    Sridhar had been in the EPRLF. According to local sources, an entire family 
    had been killed by the LTTE during the late 1980s on suspicion of having harboured 
    Sridhar, who too was later killed.</p>
  <p>17th January: Colombo: Daniel Sathasivam, the owner of a communication centre 
    near Dehiwala Junction was shot dead on the premises by members of a pistol 
    group.</p>
  <p><br>
    A change of pattern: An interlude of child conscription </p>
  <p>The sudden upsurge of murder, which peaked in mid-January tapered off into 
    reports of a new round of child conscription. Specific instances appeared 
    on web sites largely based on complaints made to the Police or the Army by 
    family members. We give some instances of these reports:</p>
  <p>28th January: Nagalingam Nagarasa (15) of Kalmadu, Vavuniya, was abducted 
    by the LTTE</p>
  <p>8th February: Kalyanakumar Sritharan (14) of Building 10, of Poonthottam 
    Refugee Camp, Vavuniya, was abducted by LTTE men who came in a trishaw. The 
    boy escaped a few days later and surrendered to the Police.</p>
  <p>12th February: Edwin Vijayakumar (12) of Kanniya, Trincomalee, was abducted 
    by an LTTE group led by the area leader who came on motorcycles.</p>
  <p>16th February: The Army website reported the abduction of two children aged 
    13 and 14 on their way back form school in Alankerni, Kinniya. The Army appears 
    to have spoken to the parents, but said that they had not complained formally.</p>
  <p>Once these reports started coming out, the LTTE obliged the UNICEF and earned 
    a few good points by releasing a couple of dozen children (a tiny fraction 
    of those caught no doubt) to the UNICEF-TRO (LTTE) run transit centres, which 
    were becoming an embarrassment to the UNOCEF after they were opened in early 
    October 2003 (See Sp. Rep 17 and Bulletin 33). <a href="#top">[TOP]</a></p>
  <p><b><a name="return"></a>7. A Return to the Elections</b></p>
  <p>The LTTE and election related violence:</p>
  <p>The LTTE began abducting real or suspected members and supporters of opposition 
    groups in the East as nominations were under way. The following were abducted:</p>
  <p>15th February: Varnakulasuriyam (45) of Vipulananda Street, Valaichenai</p>
  <p>16th February: Somasundaram Suguneswaran (30) of Temple Street, Veeramunai, 
    was a member of the EPRLF, and owing to financial difficulties joined the 
    EPDP three months earlier and was posted in Vavuniya. Abducted by the LTTE 
    while on a visit to 14th Colony, Mandur.</p>
  <p>18th February: Shanmugarajah Vijayakanthan (17) of Murungan Temple Street, 
    Kottayankerni, Valaichenai</p>
  <p>20th February: Sinnathamby Nagendran (28), Amarasingam Street, Araiampathy, 
    EPDP supporter and former member of TELO.</p>
  <p>24th February: Two LTTE men went to the home of Valli Sundaram (61) in Manipay 
    and asked a relative whether he was Mahendran Sundaram on Mr. Anandasangary's 
    independent list. They went away after warning Sundaram's wife Nageswary (55) 
    and daughter Sumithra, who came out on hearing the commotion, to tell Sundaram 
    to be careful. Sundaram was in fact a local councillor associated with the 
    EPRLF and no name on Ananadasangary's list bears any resemblance to Mahendran 
    or Sundaram. But an EPRLF member is contesting on the EPDP list. Sundaram 
    later told the SLMM who came in response to a complaint that he was afraid 
    to stay at home since the men on the motor cycle regularly hovered around.</p>
  <p>26th February: A van hired by the EPDP for election work was completely gutted 
    near Mannar Hospital Junction before dawn. A sword had been left behind at 
    the spot by the arsonists.</p>
  <p>28th February: The LTTE visited a close relative of Thurairajah Bhaskaran 
    in Mnaipay, and demanded his Colombo address. Bhaskaran, editor of the Thinamurasu, 
    is on the EPDP's electoral list for Jaffna.</p>
  <p>28th February: Members of the LTTE's Auxiliary Force went tot the home of 
    Vellupillai Sinnathurai, in Killiveddy, about 6.00 PM and demanded that they 
    search the house for one of their members who escaped. Sinnathurai's wife 
    Baby Nona and sister Manjuladevi who lived there with his 3 female children, 
    8 years and below, objected. The two women were then severely assaulted by 
    the LTTE. Sinnathurai, being the Trincomalee area leader of the EPRLF is forced 
    to live in town and is not a candidate this time, but the party line is to 
    support alternatives to the LTTE.</p>
  <p>Election-campaigning LTTE-style</p>
  <p>The incidents above illustrate the carefully calculated nature of the campaign 
    being directed by the LTTE hierarchy. Although the TNA candidates are very 
    much part of this violence, they would feign complete innocence despite TNA's 
    Sampanthan telling the Press soon after nominations that they are fighting 
    the LTTE's battle. One would as time goes lose count of the number of times 
    the TNA candidates bowed, paid obeisance and swore oaths before Prabhakaran's 
    photograph.</p>
  <p>Given the reality where parties and party workers opposed to the LTTE are 
    being beaten, intimidated and abducted to prevent them conducting any kind 
    of campaign, even in the government-controlled area, the LTTE demanded polling 
    booths to be set up in areas under its control. It has warned of serious consequences 
    if its demand was not granted. We reliably understand that the Norwegian government 
    too pushed for it, without any guarantee that it would not amount to a clean 
    heist.</p>
  <p>Leave alone the fact that those having differences with the LTTE must expect 
    the worst in going to these areas; the SLMM's monitoring mandate does not 
    cover LTTE-controlled areas. Peacemakers today are so bankrupt that they have 
    no ideas except to repeat 'Don't provoke the LTTE'. Apart from the absence 
    of any open opposition campaign in the LTTE-controlled area, the news is so 
    controlled that people living there are commonly not aware of any symbol other 
    than TNA's house.</p>
  <p>The people in LTTE-controlled areas should be given the right to vote under 
    conditions where the exercise of the vote is meaningful. That requires placing 
    some preconditions before the LTTE. Many so-called Sinhalese intellectuals 
    turn a blind eye to the context and speak of this right to vote as though 
    the Tamils were barbarians who only understand and deserve Tiger-democracy. 
    By advocating for the Tamils something that would raise their indignation 
    if inflicted on the Sinhalese, they make no secret of their contempt for the 
    Tamil people.</p>
  <p>Ironically, the TNA manifesto calls for a closing down sale of the community 
    lock, stock, and barrel by voting for the LTTE as its sole representatives. 
    The LTTE is pre-empting it with the help of the international community. <a href="#top">[TOP]</a></p>
  <p><b><a name="international"></a>8. Elections and the International Community</b></p>
  <p>It requires no massacre. It takes only a few selected killings for the LTTE 
    to determine the fate of the elections by scaring off candidates and their 
    supporters. The international community is going to monitor these elections 
    and make important pronouncements. It is also their obligation to reflect 
    on their own role. It is not hard to see that they have contributed much to 
    the growing turbulence in Sri Lanka. </p>
  <p>Despite the many faults of the Kumaratunge government, its attempt to bring 
    about a constitutional resolution to the basic conflict had significant merit, 
    and should have been supported. But although this was the longstanding Tamil 
    aspiration, the LTTE did not want it and the UNP of Ranil Wickremasighe saw 
    some narrow political advantage in undermining such a resolution. As the 1999 
    presidential election drew near, the peace lobbies backed by the West and 
    the UNP presidential aspirant advocated the same line - appeasement of the 
    LTTE. This was clearly reflected in the document where the National Alliance 
    for Peace addressed questions to the candidates pointing to recognition of 
    the LTTE as sole representatives along the road to peace. This was also candidate 
    Wickremasinghe's line. The fate of the Tamil people in such an arrangement 
    was not considered.</p>
  <p>These same peace lobbies doubled up as civil society organisations leading 
    election-monitoring groups, wielding considerable influence in guiding foreign 
    monitors. A number of them showed their distinct UNP bias and their unconcealed 
    contempt for Tamils who opposed the LTTE. Such powerful links helped the UNP 
    to deceitfully undermine President Kumaratunge's efforts at a constitutional 
    settlement and get away with it.</p>
  <p>Out of all these manoeuvrings came the misnamed &quot;peace process&quot; 
    of early 2002. Backed by the West, it was executed in the double-tongued, 
    secretive spirit in which deals had been struck with the LTTE. The Norwegians 
    should have known better. They should have recognised the obvious risks in 
    disregarding constitutional propriety and sidelining the President (who despite 
    her party's numerical disadvantage in parliament maintained decisive executive 
    power). They disregarded the democratically minded Tamils, but even more dangerous, 
    they ignored the rising humiliation and unease felt by the Sinhalese-Buddhist 
    majority. Moreover, by trying to build peace through strengthening a force 
    that suppresses its people in the name of national self-determination, the 
    Norwegians have helped to catalyse fragmentation by actors playing the regional 
    card in a similar fashion as Karuna has done.</p>
  <p>And here we are today. The North-East is being rendered a desert where people 
    are thirsting for the bare essentials of a moral human existence. The South 
    is restive. The skewed peace process following in the wake of aggressive globalization 
    has left the Sinhalese Buddhists, the majority of whom were essentially open 
    to a genuine federal solution, feeling robbed of something that is fundamentally 
    to do with their existence. When demagogues speak mischievously of a Western-Christian 
    conspiracy to secure votes, they are on fertile ground. The nation is paying 
    a heavy price.</p>
  <p>Through all this Ranil Wickremasinghe, who is being promoted by the Western 
    media as the champion of peace, has played the 'slippery' politician, as several 
    foreign correspondents have known him over the years. He came to a secret 
    understanding with the LTTE, ditched President Kumaratunge's proposed constitution 
    at the 11th hour, and flirted with Sinhalese extremists who opposed the constitution 
    as giving too much to the Tamils. His peace process was stalled, ironically 
    because the LTTE did not did not want to discuss a federal solution that was 
    never part of any of their deals. Wickremasinghe had no options left except 
    a covert surrender of the North-East. Finally, the people of the North-East 
    are left very much on their own.</p>
  <p>PA/JVP alliance </p>
  <p>The steps towards the President's call for snap elections were propelled 
    by the new alliance between the PA and the JVP. The increasing popular support 
    for the PA, for the JVP and for a push towards the alliance reflects a critical 
    mishandling of the peace process by the UNP (UNF), the international community 
    and the peace NGOs. All of them, deliberately or by default, failed to advance 
    a broader peace process that would involve all political parties. There was 
    limited discussion in the public sphere about the kind of political solution 
    the people envisioned. Rather than appeal to the people's sense of fair play, 
    the peace deal and the LTTE's conditions for an ISGA were presented as fait 
    accompli decided by the power brokers of this world.</p>
  <p>Sinhalese chauvinism in the South has been on the ascendant in reaction to 
    perceived humiliation and the LTTE's unchecked breaches of the cease-fire. 
    The combined force of these developments, the mood in the South, and the clumsy 
    manner in which the PA and the President were sidelined, led to the President 
    seizing several key ministries, and in turn, the Norwegians withdrawing from 
    their facilitatory role and the Prime Minister causing unwanted panic by questioning 
    the validity of the cease-fire agreement. The stalemate precipitated elections 
    after the PA hurriedly sew up an alliance with the obscurantist JVP, which 
    left the alliance's solution to the ethnic conflict in a welter of confusion.</p>
  <p>Faced with a hostile international community suspicious of the alliance's 
    attitude to globalization and the JVP's readiness to make populist use of 
    an outmoded chauvinism and its influence over labour unions in power games, 
    a prospective PA-led government after April 2nd may be haunted by the decisions 
    it made in the last few months. On the other hand, as often happens to obscurantist 
    forces, the JVP may once more demonstrate its capacity to somersault. The 
    contrast between its implacable verbal hostility to India in the latter 1980s 
    and its very deferential attitude to India today has largely gone unnoticed.

    <b><br>
    <a name="failure"></a>9. The Failure of Tamil Parliamentary Politics</b></p>
  <p>The Tigers' hopes of a clean sweep at the elections have been threatened 
    by the unexpected defiance of the TULF leader Anandasangaree in putting up 
    an independent list. In going step-by-step using his office as party president, 
    he played his cards with notable acumen exposing his detractors as spineless 
    tools of the LTTE. The LTTE's terror succeeded in confining the threat to 
    Jaffna. Most of the candidates on his list are living exposed in their homes 
    in Jaffna without protection. Among them is Chellan Kandaiyan, former mayor 
    of Jaffna, who defied the LTTE that prevented him from opening the rehabilitated 
    Jaffna Public Library. Significantly, T. Subarthiran of the EPRLF who was 
    constantly at Kandiayan's side strengthening him, was assassinated by the 
    LTTE last June (our Special Rep. No 16 and statement on Subthiran).</p>
  <p>What was disappointing was the failure of the other Tamil opposition groups 
    to answer the urgent need of the hour, drop their outmoded acronyms whose 
    relevance ended in 1986, and come together as a democratic alternative. This 
    happened largely because of grand delusions of the EPDP leadership, still 
    giving priority to the commerce of parliamentary politics. These parties coming 
    together as a clear democratic alternative would have given the people some 
    hope. The public would however be bemused by any call from the EPDP for clean 
    elections. By playing Little Jack Horner at this juncture, the EPDP leader 
    has done a great disservice to democratically minded members of all opposition 
    groups, including his own, who are all now facing the full brunt of Pottu 
    Amman's legions.</p>
  <p>The TNA candidates have shown themselves to be below contempt by fighting 
    the elections largely on the strength of the Tigers' determination to exterminate 
    their opponents. LTTE political leader Tamil Chelvan told journalists recently 
    that once elected, the job of the TNA MPs will be to secure for the Tigers 
    the position of sole representatives. However, their methods illuminate what 
    they really think of their acceptance among the people. </p>
  <p>The events on the ground portend very clearly that the elections in the North-East 
    would be so foul, murderous and one sided to even remotely reflect the people's 
    choice. <a href="#top">[TOP]</a></p>
  <p><b><a name="monitors"></a>10. What the Monitors can do</b></p>
  <p>At present it looks as though the LTTE would get through most of its killing 
    before foreign monitors are even on the ground. The best they can do now is 
    to arrive early and start interacting with the candidates and their supporters. 
  </p>
  <p>More importantly they should learn from their past mistakes and understand 
    that the attack on democracy and the effective rigging of elections has been 
    going on methodically for a long time. Further, foreign monitors are under 
    no political compulsion to give legitimacy to the Tigers' attempt to use 'democracy' 
    to climb into the seat of power and kick the ladder as Hitler did. It is important 
    that the legitimacy they seek as 'sole representatives' should be denied.</p>
  <p>However shamefully sensational the election violence by the major parties 
    in the South, it should not detract from the fact that the violence in the 
    North-East is qualitatively of a different order. A number of gangsters and 
    criminals will be entering Parliament in the South. Several of them infamously 
    demonstrated their prowess in July 1983. But they were far from ending democracy, 
    free expression or the prospect of reform.</p>
  <p>In comparison to all these gangsters from the South put together, even the 
    more urbane and even 'non-violent' TNA candidates are a far greater menace 
    to society. Apart from the insidious violence of their election, they stand 
    for the ending of all democracy and the sanctioning of institutionalised murder, 
    child conscription and plunder of those with little in life besides their 
    children. Nevertheless Karuna's move must have left them with a feeling of 
    now adding fire-walking to the penances they perform before the Leader. <a href="#top">[TOP]</a></p>
  <p><b><a name="karunas"></a>11. Karuna's Move</b></p>
  <p>A number of issues that were suppressed during a time of war have reemerged 
    in the East under the cease-fire. The LTTE's conduct has exacerbated older 
    feelings of being exploited by a Jaffna-based elite. It is not the far graver 
    issue of mass child conscription that was brazenly inflicted on Batticaloa 
    by Karuna himself in 2001 that touched off this resentment. The elites, whether 
    in Jaffna or Batticaloa, have shown themselves largely inured to such matters, 
    which afflicted mainly the poor, the utterly helpless and the widows from 
    two decades of war and despoliation. The issue was rather the division of 
    spoils from aid and aid agencies among the elites. The new elite is not in 
    Jaffna or Batticaloa, but in the Vanni - the top ranks of the LTTE and their 
    hangers on - and the crop of government agencies and NGOs, mainly based in 
    Colombo, that channel or service this aid. It seemed a good recipe to consolidate 
    the peace process sans democracy.</p>
  <p>To give one example related by well-placed citizens in Batticaloa, an NGO 
    formulated a project where Karuna as well as some leading citizens were on 
    the board. As part of the project several scores of vehicles were obtained 
    for development work in Batticaloa. All the vehicles, these persons said, 
    ended up in the Vanni. These persons were sitting with Karuna and writing 
    projects while Karuna's other child conscription enterprises did not touch 
    them as much as the vehicles going to the Vanni.</p>
  <p>A leaflet put out by Karuna on 4th March set out his faction's grievances 
    against the Vanni leadership. Among them are: Exclusion of the Batticaloa-Amparai 
    District from development work in spite of the region's highly disproportionate 
    contribution to the LTTE's war effort (4,550 killed in mainly Northern battles); 
    Northern leaders who head all 30 departments living in luxury while 600 Eastern 
    cadres posted far from home man bunker lines and provide security for them; 
    Northern leadership demanding the dispatch of thousands of more Eastern cadres 
    to the North in order to prepare for war; Intelligence Unit cadres under Pottu 
    Amman unleashing murder and plunder in the East.</p>
  <p>Most of these grievances struck a responsive chord among people in Batticaloa-Amparai. 
    Residents contacted by us said that things were strangely calm initially, 
    with no open displays, but people are agitated within. And with good reason. 
    Prabhakaran's killer machine is around and nearly all Eastern commanders obeyed 
    the Leader's orders to move to the Vanni, including Kausalyan (political leader), 
    Keerthi (intelligence), Ram (military) and Senathy (town area leader). Karuna's 
    deputy Ramesh went subsequently, while Karuna went into hiding in the interior 
    reflecting his apprehensions. </p>
  <p>By 6th March, however, there were public demonstrations in Batticaloa-Amparai, 
    which, even when not openly critical of Prabhakaran, were broadly supportive 
    of the issues raised by Karuna and urged the Leader to settle matters peacefully. 
    The elite too in turn had crisis meetings and moved to approach the Leader 
    for an amicable settlement. For the first time there was open discussion of 
    many issues.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile in an interview with the BBC Tamil Service on 7th March, Karuna 
    stated that as a condition for a settlement, Prabhakaran should remove his 
    intelligence chief Pottu Amman, financial chief Thamilenthi and police chief 
    P. Nadesan. A democratic reform group could hardly have pitched a more apt 
    demand. </p>
  <p>What tipped the scales?</p>
  <p>Karuna emerged as the hero of the Northern military offensive that pushed 
    back the Sri Lankan Army from large chunks of territory in the North between 
    November 1999 and May 2000, culminating in the conquest of Elephant Pass and 
    the near fall of Jaffna. He was a trusted commander of Prabhakaran who was 
    posted back to Batticaloa in December 2000 to undertake the rebuilding of 
    the LTTE's depleted ranks. To this end Karuna launched forced, especially 
    child, conscription from August 2001 (our Bulletins 26 - 28), making it compulsory 
    for each family to give a child 'voluntarily'. Karuna's leaflet above says 
    sheepishly, &quot;Parents from the district had voluntarily given their sons 
    and daughters to the LTTE to safeguard their district. And it was to respect 
    the assurances given to the parents and to use the cadres for development 
    work in the district that the order to send the troops [to the North] was 
    not carried out.&quot;</p>
  <p>Karuna was also pampered by Prabhakaran and did more than his share for the 
    ruin of the East. He was ambitious to consolidate his grip on his own area, 
    Valaichenai - Kiran and on the eve of his return to Batticaloa, Nimalan Soundaranayagam, 
    newly elected MP from that area, was assassinated on his orders (see below). 
    At the next elections a year later, on Karuna's instructions his uncle and 
    UNP organizer Kumaraguru was placed by then political leader Karikalan in 
    the TULF list for Batticaloa. Kumaraguru polled very badly. Karuna's brother 
    and area leader Reggie was given a virtual monopoly of the seafood trade in 
    the Vaharai - Kalkuda area. Karuna's hand was also evident in the violent 
    repression of the large Muslim population in the area (our Sp. Reps. 14 - 
    17). Thus Karuna's blaming Pottu Amman for all the murder and pillage needs 
    to be taken with a pinch of salt.</p>
  <p>Where then did the problem arise? Karuna's prestige and Prabhakaran's heavy 
    dependence on his conscripts to carry out his Eelam agenda had made Karuna, 
    a relatively junior man, into a major force in the organization. His own ambitions 
    too needed to be watched in an organization where the main cement is fear. 
    Prabhakaran enforces this by what one may term informal decentralisation. 
    Thus among intelligence cadres posted in the area for example, many may be 
    in practice Karuna's men. But there would be others, who known or unknown 
    to Karuna would have been Pottu Amman or Prabhakaran loyalists.</p>
  <p>We recorded for example in Sp.Rep.14 that Pottu Amman spent some time in 
    Batticaloa from late April 2002 supervising arrangements for conscription, 
    intelligence gathering, targeting of opponents and planting spies, assassins 
    and suicide operatives in Colombo. Whatever the tensions between them, Karuna 
    worked closely with him. The Batticaloa TNA list was finalised at Karuna's 
    office, but Northern leaders too would have had their say in it. These parallel 
    and joint operations by persons with diverse loyalties are necessary for Prabhakaran's 
    ultimate control, but are pregnant with tensions that could blow out of proportion 
    when there are serious differences. Those in the North-East come across situations 
    where they are questioned by LTTE intelligence operatives, but later find 
    that the local intelligence men knew nothing and are annoyed about it.</p>
  <p>Murder operations often involve a multiplicity of actors and are designed 
    to hide the source. On 8th November 2000, Nimalan Soundaranayagam answered 
    a call to meet local military commander Nagesh, a man under Karuna, in the 
    Kiran area. It being a rainy day, Nagesh persuaded Nimalan to wear a helmet 
    and jacket given by him. On the way back he was shot dead by gunmen who were 
    outsiders. The people identified the local LTTE man who acted as pointer, 
    and Karuna as the one who gave the order. But the killers from outside were 
    very likely from Pottu Amman's Intelligence Wing.</p>
  <p>Karuna's statements indicate that the main difference with Prabhakaran arose 
    over his reluctance to send additional cadres to the North. Even indirectly 
    Karuna would have constantly faced pressures from parents demanding to see 
    their children and he had conscripted so many. Finally when the two elections-related 
    murders took place on 1st March, the Vanni leadership would have come under 
    pressure with the media citing Tamil Chelvan's statement banning Southern 
    parties from contesting. Karuna's name would have come up in the internal 
    blame game - an additional point in the charge sheet summoning him to HQ. 
    Except for the timing the murders were not an issue for Prabhakaran or Karuna.</p>
  <p>The scales were tipped. Believing that the Intelligence Wing had orders to 
    bring him in, Karuna sent away all officers from the North. From the experience 
    of Mahattaya and Karikalan he knew that if he went North, he would not come 
    back for a long time if at all he did. The politician in him emerged. In a 
    populist vein he contacted the press. And he blamed all the murders on Pottu 
    Amman and listed the grievances of the Batticaloa-Amparai people, which as 
    his letter to Prabhakaran of 2nd March indicates, he had never raised before. 
    The letter says: &quot;Because of the reverence in which we hold you, we have 
    borne our hurt in silence. But now the problems have become very grave&#133;&quot; 
    He demanded total autonomy with no Northerners holding office in his domain 
    - something suicidal for Prabhakaran to accede to. <a href="#top">[TOP]</a></p>
  <p><b><a name="crack"></a>12. The Crack and its significance for Human Rights</b></p>
  <p>Whether or not Karuna survives, a wide crack has appeared in the LTTE's fa&ccedil;ade. 
    The disarming of Eastern cadres in the North has placed the organization on 
    the same road, which led to its bloodying Tamil - Muslim relations. The crack 
    may also provide opportunities. Karuna may be reaching out to his former adversaries 
    for his survival - the Muslims for example. It is time to move on demanding 
    democratic safeguards for all other sections in the East and the release of 
    child conscripts. It would have positive repercussions in the North.</p>
  <p>The opportunity provided by this break would be wasted if there were no decisive 
    movement towards a political settlement. At the root of the problem is the 
    history of violence directed by the State and the failure to reach a political 
    settlement. If the apparent weakening of the LTTE is seen as an occasion to 
    play with the question of a political settlement, history is bound to repeat 
    itself. Provoking reprisal violence against Tamil civilians is the most ready 
    means by which the LTTE has asserted its status as the only hope of the Tamils.</p>
  <p>There are many reasons why the Sri Lankan and other governments will tread 
    warily with regard to Karuna's appeals for help. The two year cease-fire has 
    been well-used by the LTTE to enhance its potential for terror in the South. 
    But other organizations should have more flexibility. <a href="#top">[TOP]</a></p>
  <p><b><a name="dangerous"></a>13. A Dangerous and Tenuous Triumph</b></p>
  <p>At one level the Tigers have outsmarted everyone. Foreign envoys who were 
    confident of taming the LTTE and 'engaged' with it, are now practically doing 
    its bidding. Its crimes are accepted in the name of preserving peace. It earns 
    tens of millions of dollars monthly from protection rackets among expatriate 
    Tamils and extorts unbearably huge sums from people in the North-East. Yet 
    its laughable claim that the North-East suffers from poverty and lack of development 
    solely because of government neglect, is readily pandered to. To longtime 
    observers, the LTTE's power looked limitless. The LTTE has set a blazing precedent 
    for other forces to twist the foibles of the world order to their advantage. 
    This was the LTTE's hour of triumph.</p>
  <p>But it is nervous. It is fearful - and with good reason. Time and advancing 
    years will not be kind to its leaders, who are long past the age of being 
    pin-up figures. Cracks are beginning to appear. We see increasingly among 
    crimes committed by LTTE cadres those of a personal and petty criminal nature. 
    The break that came with Karuna's rebellion illustrates the danger constantly 
    present in the politics of hubris.</p>
  <p>The LTTE's leader-centred politics in the absence of human values or basic 
    moral inhibitions left fear as the only basis for cohesion. Its ideological 
    intolerance and readiness to kill on the slightest pretext did not allow people 
    to be normal human beings who are permitted to make mistakes, learn from them 
    and correct themselves. It has left everyone a hypocrite and everyone a traitor.</p>
  <p>Karuna is a living example. He was an archetypal hero, the group's most publicised 
    military champion. Yet the human substance was weak. He also proved himself 
    the archetypal &quot;traitor.&quot; (to use the LTTE's own menacing words). 
    In everyone in this society, the arch-hero and the arch-traitor cohabit the 
    same human frame. All know it - from the TNA candidates to the editor of TamilNet.</p>
  <p>Persons from the generation of the LTTE leaders who challenged them are tired 
    or dead. The leaders have however failed to steal the community's history. 
    A rising generation will hold them to account for their crimes.</p>
  <p>Prabhakaran has atrophied within the closed world he fashioned for himself. 
    Far more to blame are the professors, priests and professionals who have provided 
    the sophistication and urbane veneer to what would otherwise have been yet 
    another movement built on a leader with a millennial ideology, known best 
    for the kind of brutality witnessed at Kanagampuliayady</p>
  <p><b>The Worms Turn</b></p>
  <p>In the Tamil polity that seemed stone dead, we are suddenly witnessing some 
    apparently suicidal or desperate acts of courage that have become a major 
    headache for the LTTE. At one end we have Anadasangaree and a number of fellow 
    candidates placing their lives on the line, openly defying the LTTE. The same 
    holds for younger candidates from other groups who refused to be cowed by 
    the LTTE. </p>
  <p>It raises some interesting questions. Norway gave transmitters to the LTTE 
    as though they were having problems in making themselves heard and needed 
    help to disseminate their ideas of peace. Will the Norwegians now do something 
    for those ready to challenge them? Will they take the initiative to at least 
    allow a few campaign meetings in the Vanni to be held in security, at least 
    to let the people know what the parties stand for and their election symbols?</p>
  <p>Might is Right has been the basis on which the Norwegian-brokered MoU was 
    framed. Repeated appeals by others that it needed revision because it in effect 
    gave open sanction for the LTTE to consolidate its terror in the government-controlled 
    areas went unheared. Those who had to flee their homes into abject misery 
    owing to the LTTE's violence, or to protect their children from its abduction 
    gangs, were simply ignored. </p>
  <p>There have never been any real openings for those who deserted from the LTTE. 
    They were an embarrassment. Hardly anyone wanted to know they existed. Money 
    was where one wanted to pander to the LTTE as part of globally sponsored appeasement. 
    Its victims who were badly in need of help were not a force to reckon with 
    from the donors' and Norway's point of view. Now Karuna, whatever the future 
    holds for him, has breached the dam. One way or the other it has created an 
    opening for many more worms to turn. The so far imaginary &quot;Third Force&quot; 
    might finally put on flesh. A demand for revision of the MoU has reemerged. 
    Will now at least giving human rights its due place in dealing with such questions 
    replace the folly of blind appeasement of brute force? </p>
  <p>The advice Tamil Chelvan received from LTTE ideologue Balasingam in London, 
    after which he said that Southern parties would not be allowed to contest, 
    heralded the murder of political opponents. It in turn triggered the LTTE's 
    present crisis. From London Balasingam has repeatedly talked about 'garlanding' 
    opponents (as they did Rajiv Gandhi!). Will the British government finally 
    stop playing games with him, and, in the name of democracy at least, show 
    some concern for the 'snakes' (priority opponents) and 'rattle-snakes' (non-priority 
    opponents) he talks about? <a href="#top">[TOP]</a></p>
