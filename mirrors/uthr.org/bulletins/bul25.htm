  <p style='text-align:justify'>Observers of the Sri Lankan scene from about the 
    middle of 2000 would be struck by signs of a slide with the darker impulses 
    gaining ascendancy. Widespread accounts of torture and sadism &#150; most 
    of them reported exclusively in the Tamil Press &#150; are a depressing reminder 
    of the state of the country. Pledges of good intentions by the Government 
    ring unreal against its inability to take a forthright position when the victims 
    of violations belong to a minority. This was evident following the massacre 
    of 27 Tamil inmates of the Bindunuwewa rehabilitation centre last October 
    and the mob attack on Muslims in Mawanella in early May. In both instances 
    the Police were culpable of complicity while the Government equivocated. The 
    Government appears to lack the will for the kind of decisive action that would 
    stop this slide.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>These developments come against a background where 
    the Government instead of taking the initiative is reacting to pressures. 
    Among these are economic pressures resulting from a heavy defence expenditure 
    and political pressures. Both these ultimately stem from the Government&#146;s 
    inability to institute even minimal constitutional measures, such as would 
    reassure the Tamils of its seriousness in addressing politically their unenviable 
    plight. This owes in part to the (present) parliamentary political reality 
    as well as the short-term opportunism of the political forces, not least the 
    Tamil parties who claim to be in the mainstream. It needs mature political 
    leadership to overcome the deep crisis the whole of Sri Lankan society is 
    in. Such leadership is now lacking on all fronts. Although international and 
    local realities have exerted&nbsp; pressure on the Government and the LTTE 
    to talk and reach a settlement, the Government appears to be losing its ability 
    to keep a cool head and respond&nbsp; creatively. This stems in part from 
    its coalition formation dependent on disparate forces.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>On the other hand internal pressure on the LTTE 
    from a strangled Tamil community has at present very little&nbsp; impact. 
    At the same time the fluid dispensation at national level has driven several 
    of the political actors to fish for deals with the LTTE. The LTTE has thus 
    been awarded the capacity to manipulate political and military opportunities 
    on a broad canvas to its advantage, irrespective of the interests of the Tamil 
    people.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>It is here that the present drift in which human 
    rights have been allowed to suffer neglect and deterioration causes concern. 
    In the meantime the Tamil people have been pushed into a corner by a conjunction 
    of both the Government and the LTTE, and their voices will not count in any 
    negotiations. Particularly disastrous would be the Government compounding 
    its problem of&nbsp; legitimacy among the Tamil people through its continued 
    neglect of human rights. A consequence of this would be that the LTTE, a nihilistic 
    authoritarian force, would be sanctioned&nbsp; as the legitimate guardian 
    of Tamil interests by many sections advancing peace. This could at best be 
    a brief illusion of peace &#150; a peace compatible with massive human rights 
    violations during and after.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Sadly, the inadequacies of the Government and 
    the Southern Polity will continue to lead many to entertain a blind spot for 
    the LTTE&#146;s true nature, so prolonging the agony of the Tamils.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;This bulletin examines the current human 
    rights situation and its implications for peace, stressing the need for more 
    aggressive monitoring. We will first examine several salient features of a 
    well known recent case, which help us to explore the system.<a href="#_Toc519425443">

  <h3><a name="_Toc519425445"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
13.5pt'>1. The Rape of Two Women in Mannar</span></a><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt'><o:p></o:p></span></h3>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Two women, Sinnathamby Sivamany Weerakoon (24) 
    and Vijikala Nanthakumar (22) along with the six year old son of the former 
    and the husband of the latter were picked up by the naval personnel from Asika 
    Lodge in Mannar, on the night of 19th March 2001. They were driven to the 
    Counter Subversive Unit (CSU) of the Police in Mannar and Vijikala and her 
    husband were taken into the building. According to the testimony of the women, 
    while Sivamani was alone in the van, a naval rating stepped on her mouth to 
    silence her while she was raped in turn by two naval personnel.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Meanwhile, inside the CSU, Vijikala was stripped, 
    and a sock was tied around her eyes. She fainted as she was gang raped by 
    several CSU men. Vijikala's hands and legs were then tied and she was suspended 
    on a pole between two tables and tortured until she admitted that she belonged 
    to the LTTE. She was made to sign the proverbial confession prepared in Sinhalese. 
    Sivamani was then brought in about 5.00 AM and Vijikala was made to strip 
    her. She was similarly suspended on a pole and tortured. According to their 
    testimony, N.P.N. Suraweera, OIC, CSU, Mannar, was party to these proceedings. 
    It was after the Mannar Bishop, the Rt.Rev. Rayappu Joseph, visited the two 
    women in remand prison on the 27th that the matter started receiving wide 
    publicity.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>We now come to features that we will return to 
    in a wider context.<a href="#_Toc519425443"> [Top]</a></p>
  <h3><a name="_Toc519425446"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
13.5pt'>2. The System: Licensing Abuse</span></a><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt'><o:p></o:p></span></h3>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>We are given to understand that DMO Mannar, Dr. 
    G. Somasekaram, examined the women on 22nd March, and found no signs of abuse 
    and again examined them on 30th March under the direction of the Magistrate 
    and found symptoms of grave abuse! How is it that the women were produced 
    for a medical examination on the 22nd, apparently to no purpose since they 
    were found perfectly well, but were produced before the Magistrate for the 
    first time only at 6.30 PM on the 27th? According to the <i>Veerakesari</i> 
    of 31st March, the Human Rights Commission (HRC) officials led by the District 
    Co-ordinator Raja Ravindran (based in Vavuniya) had been investigating the 
    case from about 27/28th March - after the public alarm had been raised. However 
    it was mandatory for the CSU to inform the HRC immediately upon arrest. These 
    are just two instances of things going wrong. </p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Most revealing in this connection is the petition 
    submitted to the Appeal Court by OIC N.P.N. Suraweera (<i>Island</i> 18.4.2001). 
    This was after Justice Minister and Chairman of the Anti-Harassment Committee, 
    Mr. Batty Weerakoon, on 11th April, ordered the IGP to arrest the suspected 
    CSU and naval personnel and produce them before the Mannar Magistrate, Mr. 
    M.H.M. Ajmer. Mr. Ajmer had on 31st March directed SP Mannar to produce the 
    suspects before him on 9th April. The SP directed the order to the IGP. On 
    5th April Deputy Defence Minister Mr. Ratwatte, parried questions about this 
    incident in Parliament by citing the first medical report which found no abuse.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>On 3rd April the Navy's Media Co-ordinator, Commander 
    Rohan Amarasinghe, issued a statement rejecting as <i>'absolutely false'</i> 
    allegations that naval personnel were involved in the abuse of the women. 
    It was when it transpired at a meeting of the Anti-Harassment Committee that 
    nothing had been done on the Magistrate's order to produce the suspects that 
    Minister Weerakoon intervened in a rare move of its kind. Thus came the petition 
    from Suraweera, one of the accused, who tried to protect himself by inculpating 
    the whole system. At first glance he may appear to have acted correctly, until 
    one recognises that the system has atrophied to a point where those involved 
    in the legal process do not know their priorities and prerogatives. Everything 
    is primed against the victims, who at present are mainly Tamil. What follows 
    is based on Suraweera's information and the testimony of the victims.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><b>The Recording of Statement: </b>According to 
    Suraweera the statements from the women were recorded at 3.00 PM on the 20th 
    in the presence of a woman police constable. However Vijikala had testified 
    that she signed the statement admitting that she was a member of the LTTE 
    during the rape and torture 12 hours earlier. She said this without any premeditation. 
    However it is clear that the women were not questioned after the 20th afternoon, 
    and in all probability not after dawn on the 20th. We shall see that there 
    was absolutely no case against the women.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>The argument adduced in counter-terrorism measures 
    for a discretionary delay in producing a detainee before a magistrate is that 
    it enables more complete intelligence to be extracted. The case of the women 
    is a clear instance of the widespread abuse of this provision. For, although 
    the women were not questioned after the 20th afternoon, they were not produced 
    before the Magistrate until more than seven days later on the 27th evening. 
    It is easy to see how the Magistrate who is the linchpin of law enforcement 
    is cowed and reduced to a cipher by the licence given to the security forces.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><b>The Human Rights Commission: </b>Suraweera 
    has stated that he informed the HRC's Vavuniya office of the arrests on 21st 
    March. He adds that HRC's district co-ordinater Raja Ravindran along with 
    investigating officers Chandrasekera and Priyadharshana visited the CSU, Mannar, 
    on the 22nd and left after spending about two hours. Suraweera said that no 
    complaints were made. This suggests that the HRC had seen the victims five 
    or six days before they, according to the Press, commenced investigations.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>According to the report of the medical examination 
    done on the 30th, apart from bleeding from the vagina, Vijikala had prominent 
    marks of abuse on the visible parts of her body. These included 1/4-inch nail 
    marks (semi-circular abrasions) on her elbows, forearms and wrists. Also reported 
    were abrasions on both ears. The women were in mortal fear of speaking out 
    because of threats by the CSU. But on seeing the women the HRC officials would 
    have known that something was terribly amiss.</p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText>However, the women obtained no relief from the visit by 
    the HRC. Is it that HRC officials have become so inured to torture that they 
    merely content themselves with reporting the victims to be alive and let the 
    process go on? If so, visits by the HRC are a poor substitute for producing 
    the detainee before a magistrate. We learnt on checking with other sources 
    that the HRC officials were alarmed on seeing the women, but were apparently 
    deterred from being firm by the unsavoury reputation of the Police in Mannar. 
    However, they would have informed the HRC HQ in Colombo. Why nothing was done 
    needs to be explained.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><b>The Two Medical Examinations: </b>Suraweera 
    claims that the two women were produced before DMO (District Medical Officer) 
    Dr. G. Somasekaram on 22nd March. This reference appears just after mention 
    of the HRC visit on the same day, suggesting a connection. Suraweera&#146;s 
    claim that the HRC officials made no complaint is probably inaccurate. Suraweera 
    indicates, as the victims have averred, the presence of CSU men during the 
    so-called medical examination by saying, <i>&quot;Dr. Somasekaram had carefully 
    examined the suspects and found no injuries&quot;.</i></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>This was a peculiar medical examination where 
    the patients were threatened and taken to a doctor to tell the doctor that 
    they were fine and obtain certification from the doctor to that effect. The 
    doctor did not examine the women. Clearly this 'examination' had no place 
    in law or medical practice. Had the doctor not been so overwhelmed, he should 
    have insisted that the women be directed to him on an order from the Magistrate 
    and then there would have been no question of a police presence during the 
    examination.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Somasekaram conducted the second examination on 
    the 30th upon an order issued by the Magistrate on Wednesday, 28th. This time, 
    in a long report, he recorded symptoms of grievous torture, some externally 
    visible, and also that the women were impaired both mentally and physically, 
    and were hardly able to sit up. Owing to the delay of more than 10 days perhaps, 
    Somasekaram was unable to find symptoms on Sivamani to support her testimony 
    that she was raped twice by naval personnel.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>The first medical report was clearly obtained 
    for the purpose of a cover-up. It was used by defence officials to discredit 
    the findings of the second examination, which would very likely not have taken 
    place if not for the Bishop's intervention. We will later deal with another 
    instance of the intimidating focus of the security establishment on a doctor.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><b>The Police: </b>One upshot of the women being 
    taken to the DMO on the 22nd was that the women were seen by others and the 
    alarm was raised. Also the HRC officials talked about it privately and this, 
    we understand, was a means by which the Bishop was alerted. According to Suraweera, 
    on a complaint of assault on the women, SP (Superintendent of Police) Nihal 
    Kalansuriya visited the women at the CSU on the 24th, but received no complaint. 
    This surely inculpates the SP, given the condition of the women. Moreover, 
    the SP would have found that the women were neither being questioned, medically 
    treated nor charged, and should have insisted that they be produced before 
    the Magistrate and released, or a request be made for a detention order if 
    there were credible charges. Doing nothing and leaving the women in CSU custody 
    makes the SP part of the cover-up.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Matters became difficult when Vijikala's mother 
    visited her daughter at the CSU on the 26th morning and the ICRC (rather belatedly?) 
    saw the women on the 26th afternoon and again on the 27th morning, signifying 
    that there was cause for alarm. No one seems to have informed the ICRC early, 
    not even the HRC that was apparently doing nothing? It was apparently after 
    the ICRC visits that the CSU decided to go to the Magistrate.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>On the 28th officials from Police HQ arrived in 
    Mannar, and according to the Press, the whole CSU unit was transferred on 
    the 30th. The Magistrate on the 3rd of April ordered the SP to produce all 
    concerned security personnel in Court for identification on 9th April. The 
    SP duly relayed it to the IGP and the latter duly slept on it, until Minister 
    Weerakoon intervened. In a subsequent identification parade several CSU and 
    naval personnel were identified by the women.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><b>The Grounds for Arresting the Women: </b>Suraweera 
    claims in his petition that Police HQ had informed SP CSU Bernard Silva that 
    Vijikala had been sent by the LTTE's Pottu Amman to assassinate the local 
    Navy Commander. This they communicated to the Navy, he says, who arrested 
    the three suspects and the child. As for Sivamani, Suraweera merely describes 
    her a 'suspect' - presumably like any other Tamil woman.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Sivamani faced a problem which many Tamil women 
    from the lower orders face because of the war. She married Weerakoon Banda 
    apparently when she was 14 or 15 and had 3 children, aged 9, 6 and 4. After 
    a period of separation she came to Vavuniya from Killinochchi in search of 
    her husband accompanied by her 6 year old son. She found him living with another 
    woman. After a brief polygamous arrangement which did not work, Weerakoon 
    brought her to Mannar and housed her in Asika Lodge six days before the incident. 
    It is here that the Police have made a crucial oversight in their attempted 
    cover up.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>If Sivamani were a 'suspect' in some diabolical 
    plan such as assassinating the local Navy Commander, after taking down her 
    statement on the 20th morning the CSU should have quickly moved to arrest 
    Weerakoon. It was he who planted her in Mannar, so making himself a suspected 
    accomplice. Suraweera merely tells us that <i>'the detention of Sivamani was 
    communicated to her husband Weerakoon Banda by police on 21st March 2001'</i>. 
    Clearly, Sivamani was not, in any tangible sense a 'suspect'. She was only 
    being held to cover up the abuse of the women. </p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>In Vijikala's case she was pregnant. It would 
    appear that this was the first time the LTTE sent a pregnant woman, along 
    with her husband as handler, to conduct a suicide bomb attack. Strangely however, 
    for all the gruesome attention the CSU paid Vijikala, they evinced very little 
    interest in her husband Nanthakumar, who would presumably have had the crucial 
    information about the local network and contacts. Although produced before 
    the Magistrate on the 27th, the latter saw no need to medically examine Nanthakumar.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Police teams have had significant breakthroughs 
    in counter-insurgency, but never by acting in this manner. It was through 
    watching suspects, their contacts, intercepting messages and planting informants. 
    When they made arrests, they got almost the whole network, arms caches and 
    all. To pick up two women late in the night, rape them and make them sign 
    statements in a language that was unintelligible to them, is crass thuggery, 
    not policing.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>It is an outrage for security officials to intrude 
    upon the privacy, especially of women, late in the night, without sound reasons. 
    In this case it was possible to place a sentry around the building and question 
    the women in the morning. Even if there was good reason to detain them in 
    the night, there are professional ways of doing it with women personnel present. 
    No sensible judge should give any credit to the claims of security officials 
    who act with scant regard for basic decency.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>In this particular case, all claims by the Police 
    and the security establishment are a contemptible tissue of lies. So much 
    so that unable to provide a shred of evidence against the women, Suraweera 
    tries to make a point of the Bishop <i>'who is a well-known LTTE sympathiser'</i> 
    taking an interest in the case.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Any thinking person in the defence establishment 
    would have minimised the damage by having the victims released forthwith, 
    apologising to them, and instituting disciplinary measures against the offending 
    personnel. But instead, even after medical confirmation of rape and torture, 
    the authorities persisted in their shoddy drama as though they had a point 
    to make. The four, including the child, were remanded in Mannar jail on the 
    27th. Following the incriminating report from the medical examination of the 
    30th, the victims, including the women who were in a poor mental and physical 
    condition, were subject to the unnecessary strain of being transported to 
    remand prison in Anuradhapura. On the same day the entire CSU unit was transferred. 
    When summoned to the Mannar Magistrate's Court on 3rd April, the <i>Veerakesari</i> 
    reported that the party was brought from Anuradhapura under <i>'intense'</i> 
    security. The same report said that when they were thereafter committed to 
    the remand prison in Mannar, security there was <i>'strengthened'. </i>The 
    three detainees were given bail on 9<sup>th</sup> April.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><b>The Magistrate: </b>One pities the bewildered 
    magistrates in the North-East who have to deal with such contingencies. The 
    Security Establishment has usurped so much of the ground that belongs to the 
    magistrates that the latter do not know where their powers begin and where 
    they end. What can the Magistrate do if the local SP or the IGP in Colombo 
    ignores an order to produce members of the armed services in court? The answer 
    is, practically nothing! He slowly gets accustomed to being an unoffending 
    bureaucrat. However, a determined magistrate can assert himself and give lawbreakers 
    in the armed services a rough time and one or two have done it. </p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>How the Magistrate acted in this instance, and 
    was indeed expected to act, though normal in this country, is a parody of 
    professionalism and is in conformity with the regime of routine violations. 
    OIC Suraweera claims that upon the women being handed over to the CSU, an 
    application was made for a detention order, but does not say if one was obtained. 
    One trusts that the Magistrate would not have issued a detention order without 
    the 'suspects' being produced before him.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>However, after the women were taken to the doctor 
    on the 22nd March, the public in Mannar had come to know that the women had 
    been tortured and this is confirmed by the SP meeting the women on the 24th. 
    Torture has been accepted as universally reprehensible and is forbidden by 
    both international and national law. When the Magistrate has good reason to 
    believe that torture has taken place in the area under his jurisdiction, it 
    is his duty and obligation to intervene. In this instance the Magistrate should 
    have ordered the Police to produce the detainees before him. If the Police 
    refused, the matter would have got into the Press and the Government would 
    have had to respond.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>But even when the Police produced the women on 
    the 27th evening, the Magistrate meekly remanded them. No questions were asked. 
    Although this rubber stamping by magistrates of requests for detention orders 
    is standard practice in Sri Lanka, the magistrate is required to verify that 
    the grounds for suspicion cited by the Police, if any, satisfy certain objective 
    criteria. In the case of these two women, the Magistrate would have seen that 
    such objective grounds did not exist. The state of the women, their reluctance 
    to speak in front of the Police, their confessions recorded in a language 
    alien to them, the absence of any incriminating materials and the failure 
    to question Sivamani's husband, were all an indictment on the Police, rather 
    than the women.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>When the women were summoned before the Magistrate 
    on Tuesday, 3rd April, the Magistrate had the medical report and the testimony 
    from the women. There was no case from the Police because the men who supposedly 
    investigated the women had been transferred out. The Magistrate had to ask 
    the SP to bring them at a later date (if he could). Surely, there was no reason 
    to prolong the detention of the women. The State had failed to make a case. 
    The drama put on by the authorities in subjecting the women to intense security 
    after the medical examination on 30th March should be seen as a move to arm-twist 
    the Magistrate. It made it harder for the Magistrate to conclude on the basis 
    of the evidence before him, that the women were innocent victims of torture 
    and rape by security men.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>The subservient status of the magistrates and, 
    by extension, the Judiciary as a whole, is indicated in a Foreign Ministry 
    press release (<i>Island</i> 19.5.01). It reported recommendations adopted 
    at a meeting of the Inter-Ministerial Standing Committee on Human Rights (IMSCHR) 
    on 11<sup>th</sup> May, presided over by the Foreign Affairs Minister. The 
    Committee decided to recommend to the President a legal provision &#145;<i>requiring 
    suspects arrested under the PTA to be produced before a Magistrate expeditiously 
    and not later than 14 days after arrest&#133;Another recommendation was to 
    empower the Magistrates to visit and inspect, without advance notice, places 
    of detention under the PTA within their respective jurisdiction</i>&#146;. 
  </p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>This reveals an absurdity where our magistrates 
    do not have even the authority of the ICRC to visit detainees and ensure their 
    basic rights. Additional structures like the HRC have been necessitated by 
    such anomalies that have atrophied the office of the magistrate. The recommendations 
    above are no doubt in part a response to pressures arising from the case of 
    the two women. Mr. Batty Weerakoon's intervention is the only aspect of the 
    case that is to the credit of the Government. Apart from that, in attempting 
    a shoddy cover up of a crime by a few low-ranking officers, the system stands 
    indicted right up to the highest levels. We move onto an incident that throws 
    further light on the system.<a href="#_Toc519425443"> [Top]</a></p>
  <h3><a name="_Toc519425447"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
13.5pt'>3. The Massacre in Batticaloa on Vesak Day - 17th May 2000</span></a><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt'> <o:p></o:p></span></h3>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>We reported the incident in our Report No. 23 
    of July 2000. A cycle was parked opposite the office of DIG/Police Batticaloa 
    about 4.30 PM. The word soon got around that the bicycle had a bomb on it. 
    Some policemen, including Sergeant Uthayanan were out keeping people away 
    from the bomb. Some auxiliaries from the Razik group who were passing that 
    way tried to defuse the bomb, resulting in an explosion killing three of them. 
    After a gap of 5 to 10 minutes a group of men from the Special Forces rushed 
    into the area from the Army HQ across the lagoon in Puliyantivu, and fired 
    randomly at civilians.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Among those killed by firing were 10 children 
    who had been brought to town by Fr. Jeyachandran and were about to see Vesak 
    decorations. Also killed were Sergeant Uthayanan and 7 other civilians. Some, 
    including the Kacheri Recorder, had been dragged from inside shops and shot. 
    In the earlier explosion, Fr. Jeyachandran had been injured by shrapnel just 
    when Sergeant Uthayanan warned him to stay back. Several of the children who 
    came forward to help him were killed by firing of the Special Forces. A number 
    of civilians witnessed the incident and in Batticaloa Fr. Miller of the Batticaloa 
    Peace Committee stands by the foregoing as facts he has verified from his 
    own inquiries. Fr. Jeyachandran had in fact shouted at the soldiers not to 
    shoot the children.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>The government media however put out a version 
    that these deaths resulted from a bomb explosion caused by the LTTE. This 
    signalled that any bona fide inquiry had been precluded. Earlier reports from 
    Batticaloa said that doctors had removed several bullets from the hospitalised 
    victims. However, the doctor who did the autopsies certified that the deaths 
    had resulted from shrapnel injuries. He then left the station and kept away 
    for some time. From his inquiries, Fr. Harry Miller ascertained that the doctor 
    had been told by Brigade Commander Zacky to certify that the deaths had resulted 
    from shrapnel injuries and not to mention the bullets.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Fr. Miller with other members of the Peace Committee 
    had a meeting with Commander Zacky with whom they had a good working relationship 
    for 3 years. Zacky maintained that the civilians died because of the LTTE 
    bomb and no one was shot. The Special Forces men, he said, had only fired 
    into the air to disperse the crowds. Fr. Miller told him, <i>&quot;Everyone 
    knew for some time that the bomb was there and were warned to keep away. Your 
    job was to cordon off the area and defuse the bomb. But you did nothing. Why?&quot;</i> 
    Zacky replied that they did not have a bomb-disposal squad in Batticaloa!</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Fr. Miller told Zacky, <i>&quot;You say that your 
    men fired into the air. But everyone knows that the two vans which brought 
    the children were riddled with bullets. But you have concealed them from public 
    view. Why don't you put them out for all to see?&quot; </i>Zacky agreed to 
    put them out. Fr. Miller told him, <i>&quot;For three years you have had a 
    relatively good record here. There had been no incidents of reprisals against 
    civilians after attacks by the LTTE. But now you have tarnished your record.&quot;</i> 
    Zacky protested that it was not so. He said that there were two sides to an 
    incident and went on to talk about civilian casualties at English football 
    matches.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Fr. Miller observed that Zacky was normally reasonable 
    in his public relations, &#147;b<i>ut this time he was stonewalling&quot;.</i> 
    On the promise to put the bullet-ridden vehicles out, Fr. Miller said, <i>&quot;Zacky 
    did put them out. But only for an hour. They were then shoved away.&quot;</i></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Fr. Miller received his next shock when he spoke 
    to the ICRC representative. The latter came to see Fr. Miller over another 
    matter when Fr. Miller raised the shooting incident. The ICRC representative 
    said that he had seen the doctor's reports and was satisfied that the victims 
    died of shrapnel injuries. Fr. Miller told him that there was no point in 
    carrying the discussion any further.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Fr. Miller's hope that justice would be done was 
    strengthened when DIG Pathirikirikorale was sent to Batticaloa by the President, 
    ostensibly to inquire into the incident. When Fr. Miller met Pathirikirikorale, 
    the latter introduced himself as the product of another famous Jesuit institution, 
    St. Aloysius, Galle. Fr. Miller gave him all the information in his possession, 
    including the Tamil press cuttings (only the Tamil media covered the incident 
    substantially) and the funeral notices for the children, most of them from 
    around Aithiyamalai. The DIG told Fr. Miller that he had checked with the 
    police station and that no ammunition of theirs had been used on that day.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Fr. Miller then told the DIG that Fr. Jeyachandran, 
    the priest who was with the children, had been moved from Batticaloa Hospital 
    and was currently in Colombo Hospital, and that he could obtain the priest's 
    testimony. The DIG immediately rang the Police in Colombo and told them about 
    Fr. Jeyachandran. In turn the DIG was told that they had already obtained 
    Jeyachadran's testimony, according to which the Army had not fired and the 
    children died from the bomb explosion. Fr. Miller was taken aback because 
    Jeyachandran, a crucial witness, had earlier testified to them that all others 
    about him remained standing after the explosion. Pathirikirikorale went back 
    and nothing more was heard.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>When Fr. Jeyachandran was discharged from hospital 
    and returned to Batticaloa, Fr. Miller asked him about testimony to the Police. 
    Fr. Jeyachandran confessed that he was scared to tell the truth about the 
    Army firing at them. He was in a strange environment and the nurses and hospital 
    staff had been referring to him as a 'kottiya' (tiger in Sinhalese), adding 
    to his jitters. Fr. Miller added that Jeyachandran was scared even when he 
    was in Batticaloa Hospital, especially with the Army around the place. Jeyachandran 
    had feared that the Army would try to finish him off. This he had communicated 
    to Bishop Kingsley Swamipillai, who reassured him. Fr. Miller observed despondently 
    that the cause of justice seemed hopeless until there was peace. </p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>We may now observe the crucial similarities to 
    the case of the two women in Mannar, which point to the modus operandi by 
    which justice is subverted. In both cases relatively young and nervous doctors 
    caved in under pressure from the Security Forces and distorted the forensic 
    evidence. In such situations there is pressure on everyone concerned to fall 
    in line - e.g. the Magistrate, the Police and the witnesses. </p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>In the incident above for example, there was no 
    civil society organisation in Batticaloa that was able to organise witnesses 
    and carry forward the struggle for justice. The magistrate's inquest at which 
    it fell to the Police to direct the evidence was decided technically on the 
    medical reports. It would have been a bold magistrate who did not fall in 
    line. The Human Rights Commission did not inquire into the matter - this will 
    be taken up below. However, we need not doubt that the higher authorities, 
    including the President, knew the truth about the Batticaloa incident. The 
    incident was too public. To begin with, the Police were on the spot and would 
    have reported independently. This is indicated by what DIG Pathirikirikorale 
    told Fr. Miller.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>He volunteered the information that he had checked 
    and found that the Police had not fired. This was gratuitous information since 
    no one accused the Police of firing. The question was what the Army had done 
    and surely the DIG knew from his local inquiries, if not before. Moreover, 
    there were the two vans with bullet marks giving the lie to the Army's claim 
    that they only fired into the air. People even saw this in the state TV new 
    broadcast that showed neat lines of bullets on the vans coming from automatic 
    guns. We may conclude that the cover-up was directed from the top and the 
    DIG's mission was to report on a course of damage limitation - e.g. whether 
    or not a token inquiry should be launched. </p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Direct testimony of early involvement of the Police 
    in the cover up comes from a senior RC priest in Batticaloa. Since he had 
    a personal interest in the children who were killed, he went to the hospital 
    mortuary the morning after the incident. The doctor who was doing the post 
    mortems gave a sheepish smile. The priest recognised him as a former student 
    of St. Michael's. Some experienced mortuary labourers called the priest aside 
    and told him, <i>&quot;Father, these died from bullet wounds, but the doctor 
    is going to record that they died from the bomb blast</i>&quot;. A labourer 
    lifted the skirt of the young maiden who had escorted the children and showed 
    him the bullet wounds. The maiden was to be given in marriage two days from 
    the fatal incident. A little later a labourer told the priest, &quot;<i>Father, 
    you had better go, the SI (sub-inspector of police) is watching!</i>&quot; 
    The disturbingly routine nature of covering up is evident in the Navy's record.<a

mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt'><o:p></o:p></span></h3>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>The <i>Daily News </i>of Tuesday 23rd April reported 
    that the two women victims in Mannar at an identification parade picked out 
    as their assailants 2nd Lt. S.P. Nalin Kumara and D.D.I. Priyadarshana of 
    the Navy, and Inspector Patrick Suraweera and PCs Rajendra and C.V. Wimalaratne 
    from the Police. Nine other police personnel were identified at a further 
    identification parade on 10<sup>th</sup> May. The <i>Sunday Island's</i> Defence 
    Correspondent who gives considerable weight to human rights described (29.4.2001) 
    the Navy's earlier denial in the press release as <i>&quot;proven to be a 
    blatant falsehood and an official attack on press freedom&quot;.</i></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>The Defence Correspondent added, <i>&quot;Although 
    this column called upon the navy top brass to apologise publicly for its actions, 
    the silence has been deafening. This is the first time in Sri Lanka's history 
    that the armed forces officially issued a statement covering up a heinous 
    crime&#133;&quot;</i> Where does the President, who as commander-in-chief, 
    must accept responsibility for such official denials, stand in all this? Such 
    official hyperbole is an attempt to veil a rotten record.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Well known is the case of Sarathammal of Pungudutivu 
    who was raped and murdered on 28th December 1999 by four personnel from the 
    local naval detachment. The Navy denied responsibility and the judicial process 
    appears to be stymied. Some of the indiscipline in Mannar comes from corrupt 
    practices to do with smuggling to the LTTE controlled area. On 28th February, 
    the Navy at 10.00 PM detained Kandiah Uthayakumar (42), father of seven, of 
    Chavatkadu, Mannar, strangled him to death in the presence of his daughter, 
    and delivered his body to Mannar Hospital at 3.00 AM.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Some of the worst behaviour by naval personnel 
    involving abduction and extra-judicial killing, has been along the coastal 
    stretch north of Trincomalee. During twilight on 22nd November 2000, the Navy 
    shot and killed four fishermen, including a boy of 15, and injured several 
    others, two children aged 4 and 11 among them. These fisherfolk were, as was 
    their wont, attending to their nets at the mouth of the river near Gopalapuram, 
    Nilaveli, Trincomalee. The Navy prevented the villagers from removing the 
    bodies unless they certified that the dead belonged to the LTTE. The following 
    day up to about a thousand villagers launched a protest demonstration.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>After sunset on 13th December 2000, the Navy abducted, 
    tortured and killed two youths Thamiran and Sornahasan from Gopalapuram, who 
    were on their way home. The bodies of the youths, whom apparently the Navy 
    suspected of involvement in the demonstration, were found the next day. Those 
    returning from the funerals of the youths were warned of serious consequences 
    by the Navy, if they protested in future.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Asked recently if any action was taken on this 
    matter, TULF General Secretary, Mr. R. Sampanthan said that the Human Rights 
    Commission looked into the first killing of four persons. Its Chairman, he 
    said, told him that they found the four killed not to be terrorists as the 
    Navy held, and had recommended compensation. The Navy, Mr. Sampanthan said, 
    maintained that those shot were in an area frequented by the LTTE. This one 
    cannot accept. These folk were doing their regular work, were unarmed and 
    there were children among them. They were not challenged by the Navy.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>On the second incident of two youths being killed, 
    Mr. Sampanthan said that he had not heard of any inquiry. He also said that 
    about early May, the Navy had twice fired mortar shells into the recently 
    resettled Tamil fishing village of Sirupiddy, east of Sambaltivu. The second 
    time one man was injured and the whole village fled. Harassment by the Navy 
    has also made their economic life unviable. Tamil fishermen who go out in 
    the afternoon finish their work at 11.00 PM. The Navy has ordered them not 
    to return to the shore until morning. This has resulted in greater fuel costs 
    and their catch getting spoilt. The Navy imposes this restriction selectively 
    on Tamil fishermen. Mr. Sampanthan said that a senior US embassy official 
    who visited the area described the attitude of the Navy as <i>'insolent'.</i></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>The foregoing gives a cross-section of incidents 
    leading to a mood of despondency among Tamils. Open eruptions may be few. 
    But they ought to give food for thought.<a href="#_Toc519425443">[Top]</a></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt'><o:p></o:p></span></h3>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>On 30th March, the final day of the World Drama 
    Festival held at the Eastern University, the crowd of several thousands joined 
    the students in an hour's protest at the entrance to the University early 
    in the afternoon (<i>Veerakesari</i> 31.3.2001). The protest was around the 
    rape of the two women in Mannar. Among slogans against state terrorism, torture 
    and rape, a notable one read as follows: <i>&quot;O Sinhalese Nation, you 
    want our mothers to satisfy your carnal hunger (lust), to satiate your blood-lust, 
    you want our fathers, and to satiate your gluttony you want our flesh. What 
    more do you want?&quot;</i></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText>The protest was no doubt planned by a few and carefully 
    launched. However, there is also no doubt that the cause and the slogans touched 
    the gut feelings of many people who had come to the University on that occasion. 
    The near impunity with which violations occur drives home into the people 
    a sense of humiliation and servile status. This is clear from the incidents 
    above. We give below a sample of incidents from around Batticaloa.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><b>10th September 1999:</b> Kumburumoolai: Mrs 
    Rukmani&nbsp; Krishnapillai (35), mother of 5, was taken from home by the 
    Army, to the Kumburumoolai army camp and was dumped in a bunker with her eyes 
    tied. She was then taken to a room, drugged and gang raped. She was tortured 
    by being beaten, and having objects inserted into her vagina. At nightfall 
    she was taken unconscious in a tractor, dumped in the jungle and left for 
    dead. She later recovered and was helped by an old woman. Later her MP, Mr. 
    Thurairajasingam, directed her to people in Batticaloa, whence she contacted 
    the ICRC and was treated by Dr. Chandrapalan in Batticaloa Hospital. She declined 
    to take up legal action because there was no security for her family. The 
    Army came to her home again on 10th January 2000, apparently because she had 
    complained to the ICRC, assaulted her mother and took her. On the hearing 
    the sound of an explosion, the soldiers left her and vamoosed.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><b>14th March 2001 (<i>Thinakkural</i></b>) <b>Kaluwanchikudy:</b> 
    The Special Media Information Centre stated in a release that Reserve Constable 
    Ranjith of the STF was dismissed as he was accused of raping a woman. He was 
    released on bail by the Magistrate. </p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><b>21st April 2001</b>: <b>Kaluthawalai:</b> Mrs. 
    Nageswari Mahendran (34), a widow, was the mother of two sons. Her eldest 
    had joined the LTTE in 1990 and is no more living. On 17th April 2001 the 
    STF came saying that they wanted to search her house. An officer tried to 
    make her go into a room. When she refused the officer said that he would come 
    again. He returned on the 20th and tried to pull Nageswary into a room. Nageswary 
    wrenched herself away and ran out. The officer told her, <i>&quot;I am the 
    lord here, we will see what you can do&quot;,</i> and went away. The following 
    day she went to the STF HQ in Karaitivu and complained about harassment and 
    threats to her life from the local STF. The same evening the 'Lord' came home, 
    and told her, <i>&quot;I am the lord here. I can do as I please and no one 
    can ask questions&quot;.</i> He beat her mercilessly, kicked her down and 
    stood on her chest. Her son who came home was also beaten. Nageswary was later 
    admitted to Batticaloa Hospital. </p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Her son, fearing for his life, got himself taken 
    to the HQ of the Razik group, an auxiliary force, through a person in the 
    group from his area. He was later handed over to the&nbsp; Army Brigadier. 
    He was then sent to Remand Prison apparently because in a statement he had 
    confessed to being a member of the LTTE. After being discharged from hospital. 
    the mother was roaming around trying to get her son out.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Another incident from the same area, a village 
    south of Batticaloa, illustrates the erosion of steadying influences and the 
    fluid nature of dispositions. Miss. Subitha Yogarajah, a pre-O.Level student 
    at Kaluthawalai Central, was last December wrongly suspected of having stolen 
    a small amount of money from her class room. The teacher stripped her in the 
    toilet to search her. Unable to stand the humiliation, she went the next day 
    and joined the LTTE. The latter, suspecting her of being a plant, kept her 
    in a dark room for a month. She was then taken towards Vanni on foot through 
    the jungle. They ran into an ambush and she was injured in the leg by army 
    firing. She was taken back to the base. She left the LTTE and is back at home, 
    signing at the STF office every Sunday. </p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>The last incident illustrates the confused disposition 
    of the people. The STF, Army, the LTTE and the Razik group are all there, 
    and the people get on with life putting up with all of them, but without having 
    hope in any. But having marginalised all other Tamil groups or parties, the 
    LTTE alone retains the ability to summon the gut feeling of Tamil nationalism, 
    which is founded on the collective humiliation of a people. Yet, so great 
    is the disillusionment with it that the response the LTTE gets is pitifully 
    abysmal. University students and pressmen make their contribution to its cause 
    with dramatic slogans and keep a safe distance. This seed would ultimately 
    bear fruit in fragile minds like Subitha's in a moment of helplessness.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Given the continuing violations by the State and 
    the oppressive order revealed by the processes through which justice is denied, 
    organised resistance to such a State would have evoked a compelling sense 
    of duty among mature, thinking adults in most societies. This was true among 
    the Tamils in the 1970s and early 1980s. Today, to those feeling justifiably 
    angry and disillusioned with the State, the LTTE has virtually monopolised 
    the means to offering resistance. However, the voluntary support the LTTE 
    receives from people living under it is minute. Having in the early days ridiculed 
    groups that admitted women, women at present make up the majority of the LTTE's 
    casualties.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Of the nearly 140 LTTE casualties reported in 
    the Jaffna press from the confrontation of early April, more than 60% were 
    women. If one also takes into account the children, the starkness of the tragedy 
    is laid bare. In a further remarkable irony, those carrying the LTTE's message 
    urging the young to die in its cause - intellectuals, clergy, academics, media 
    men and dramatists - are practically all of them healthy, mature men. Not 
    only that, they are totally cynical. A lady who had visited Jaffna was telling 
    a Tamil church group in Australia that life in Jaffna was difficult, but fairly 
    normal and that the Sinhalese soldiers at check-points generally were polite. 
    A man called her aside and told her sternly <i>&quot;Mrs&#133; you must tell 
    them that the people in Jaffna are being starved. Only then will they contribute 
    to the LTTE!&quot;</i></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>An important part of the Tamil nationalist message 
    is that every ill that befalls Tamils is part of the planned agenda of the 
    Sinhalese Nation. This was the gist of the slogan from the Eastern University 
    cited above. Bishop Rayappu Joseph told the Press (<i>Thinakkural</i> 30.3.2001) 
    that the injustice inflicted on the two women arrested from the lodge in Mannar, 
    is <i>'a crime committed against the entire Tamil motherhood'</i>. As a defender 
    of family and motherhood, the Bishop's positions are strange. In an interview 
    with the Tamil monthly <i>Amuthu</i> earlier this year, the Bishop denied 
    that the LTTE recruits children. On family breadwinners in the Vanni being 
    importuned and taken to the front to perform suicidal military tasks, the 
    Bishop maintained that this was being done without the Leader's knowledge. 
    Such understatements set against the preceding hyperbole, surely, hides something 
    insidious.<a href="#_Toc519425443">[Top]</a></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt'><o:p></o:p></span></h3>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>During the UNP era of the 1980s and early 1990s, 
    violations against Tamils, massacres, destruction of villages and displacement 
    were primarily a part of state policy. Under the PA government since 1995, 
    the violations are secondarily, rather than primarily, part of the State's 
    intentions. They result from institutional inertia, lethargy and indiscipline 
    in the Government and the Government frequently uses inherited institutional 
    practices to cover up violations, rather than trying to change them. </p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>These violations by the State&nbsp; today are 
    violations of an imbecile character, having no future end in view. The damage 
    they do to the Tamil people is short term and can easily be confronted if 
    the Tamil people have the freedom to organise and make political demands. 
    However, these violations by the State have throughout acted as a smokescreen 
    for systematic violations by the LTTE.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>It is well-known that prolonged adversity coupled 
    with the breakdown of ties of respect and support that bind a society together, 
    is utterly detrimental to character. The LTTE has determined that the Tamils 
    will have nothing but adversity, and has been atomising people by hammering 
    away at all the healthier ties and inhibitions. It multiplied adversity amidst 
    war by contriving at reprisals by the state forces. It attacked Muslim villages 
    in the East largely in order to provoke reprisals against neighbouring Tamil 
    villages.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>When the middle classes suffer, they complain 
    vocally for a short time. But then, they and their children can escape. Tragedies 
    frequently encountered at the lower levels of society seldom reach the outside 
    world. Loss of their children to the LTTE is the most routine. We give below 
    other incidents that exemplify the kind of systematic long term manipulation 
    of people that the State can never do.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><b>i) P from Vadamaratchy</b> is the mother of 
    5 children. Her husband, a carpenter, lost his income when the LTTE broke 
    off talks and resumed war in June 1990. The husband tried itinerant trade, 
    but could not make ends meet. The LTTE gave him some work putting up platforms 
    and could cut-outs for meetings and later persuaded him into a deal. The LTTE 
    was to pay his wife Rs. 3000 a month, and the man was to be setup in a trade 
    in a northern town under army control. In time he took on a mistress and broke 
    off ties with his family. He has been arrested a number of times by the Police 
    and other armed Tamil groups, and released. During the 1995 Exodus, P and 
    her children moved to the Vanni and are in utter despondency. P, once a respectable 
    woman, had been known to ply the shadowy trade of smuggling liquor from Vavuniya 
    to make a living. This example is just the thin end of the wedge.&nbsp; </p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><b>ii) Thavamany's father</b>, who was a harbour 
    worker at KKS, became unemployed after civilians were excluded from the area 
    in 1987. The family moved to Pt. Pedro and lived in dire poverty. Thavamany 
    became engaged to Vasu, a leading LTTE figure, a key man in the Pt Pedro area 
    during the respite of peace in early 1990. Vasu helped Thavamany's family 
    by passing onto them some rations. After the war resumed, Vasu was one day 
    publicly executed by the LTTE north of the bus depot. Among the charges against 
    him was his helping Thavamany. However Vasu's transgressions were, if any, 
    small, compared with those of several senior LTTE figures spending lavishly 
    on mistresses. The reasons for his execution must be sought elsewhere.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>One day in early 1990, during the peace, Vasu 
    transported members of 'martyrs families' to a big house saying, <i>&quot;Our 
    leader wants to speak to you&quot;.</i> Additional chairs had been brought 
    for the occasion and the guests were seated and refreshments served. Suddenly 
    a new vehicle arrived, followed by an armed escort in a pick-up. Mahattaya 
    strode into the hall. Beginning his speech, he apologised for summoning the 
    guests instead of calling on them individually as he should have done. He 
    praised them for sacrificing a member of their family for their cause. He 
    went on: </p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><i>&quot;We had become depleted by fighting the 
    Indian Army and needed a break. Since [President] Premadasa called us for 
    talks, we used that opportunity. Our ultimate goal is Eelam and we will not 
    falter. The war will resume and our path will be hard&#133; Only about five 
    percent of the people support us. You are the people who must help us. You 
    can for example help us to be rid of traitors by identifying them&#133;&quot; 
    </i></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Between Mahattaya and Prabhakaran there were no 
    differences in objectives or methods. However Mahattaya, the scourge of traitors, 
    was got rid of by the latter as a traitor. Vasu&#146;s closeness to Mahattaya 
    was no doubt observed and reported. '<i>Thurohi'</i> (Traitor) has become 
    the most fickle word in the Tamil language.</p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText>After Vasu's execution, Thavamany sat long by his coffin, 
    as any faithful wife would have done, crying inconsolably. Her family moved 
    to Vadamaratchy East. News came subsequently that the bereaved and confused 
    girl had joined the LTTE!</p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><b>iii) M, a mother of 4 children</b>, lived in Kudaththanai. 
    Her husband was a lorry driver for the Karaveddy MPCS. Soldiers from the Indian 
    Army camp nearby used to come to borrow objects like an axe from him. He was 
    then killed by the LTTE. M was without means to look after her children and 
    her invalid father, a retired sub-postmaster. Seeing her helplessness, the 
    LTTE moved in to clinch a deal after the war began in 1990. They asked her 
    to move to Colombo with her crippled father and children and rent a house. 
    They would see that she receives money from abroad. She would also receive 
    instructions from them from time to time. If questioned by the Police, she 
    was to say that her brother abroad was sending her money.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>There are a number of cases of the LTTE using 
    women whom it made helpless by inflicting the loss of a dear one. The worst 
    that depraved Sri Lankan security personnel can inflict on a Tamil woman is 
    bodily harm. However the LTTE had imposed an order where it can in its time 
    and pleasure play with the very souls of vulnerable women. Many are the crimes 
    against Tamil motherhood that are whitewashed by the community's spokesmen. 
    In imposing this order, the LTTE has cleverly used violations by the State.&nbsp; 
  </p>
  <h3><a name="_Toc519425451"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt'><o:p></o:p></span></h3>
  <p class=MsoBodyText>An oft repeated canard is that the State was indeed guilty 
    of massive violations during the 1980s and early 1990s, but that is now well 
    behind us. It is a history that is however yet with us because a process of 
    justice that could have brought about change has been denied. The Tamil people 
    still see their relations with the State as governed by implicit terror.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>This has to be taken into account in understanding 
    why the two doctors and the priest in the incidents encountered above felt 
    impelled to make false declarations concerning major violations, where their 
    role was crucial in the process of securing justice. The CSU for one has an 
    unsavoury record of impunity. Moreover, in Mannar, where the security forces 
    enjoy so much unchecked power, the doctor is obliged to get permission from 
    them to travel to Colombo,&nbsp; and if he does not behave himself, he can 
    be harassed on the way. The Magistrate is hardly better off. </p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>With regard to the 1996 disappearances in Jaffna, 
    justice had been obstructed right along. The Deputy Defence Minister denied 
    that there had been any violations in Jaffna. Army Commander Daluwatte supposed 
    that the hundreds reported disappeared had joined the LTTE. President Kumaratunge 
    promised an inquiry that is yet to materialise. The Krishanthy Kumarasamy 
    case opened the lid on the matter, forcing the Government to agree to excavations 
    at Chemmani, where 15 skeletons were found. Foreign Minister Kadirgamar in 
    his legal circumlocution concluded in effect that since there was no mass 
    grave, the claims of hundreds of disappearances were false and malicious. 
    Now the matter itself has been buried.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>The Committee for the Parents and Guardians of 
    the Disappeared in Jaffna said recently that neither death certificates have 
    been issued nor the compensation paid on behalf of the 14 persons whose skeletons 
    were found at Chemmani in June 1989 and identified (<i>Veerakesari </i>31.3.2001). 
    Several of the officers responsible for the disappearances in 1996 have continued 
    to play key roles in Jaffna. Would it be practically possible to hold an open 
    public tribunal in Jaffna collecting evidence on disappearances? For the good 
    name of the Government, even the issue of death certificates will have to 
    be delayed indefinitely.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>In the face of a rising spate of violations, how 
    free are the people in the East to organise public demonstrations against 
    the Army, the Navy and the STF and pursue justice? We saw what happened to 
    two of the youths who demonstrated against killings by the Navy in Gopalapuram 
    and to two women who complained, one to the ICRC about the Army and the other 
    at the regional STF HQ. </p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>There is therefore no doubt that the regime maintained 
    by the State in the North-East continues to be oppressive in several crucial 
    respects. It would be wrong to put it down to institutional inertia alone. 
    Instead of trying to change the inherited oppressive machinery, the PA Government 
    has rather used it. It has used it to suppress the true extent of violations, 
    and to provide, as it were, props to support its claims of an excellent human 
    rights record.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>On Vesak day, 8th May, this year, the first anniversary 
    of the massacre was observed with a <i>hartal</i> (complete stoppage) in and 
    around Batticaloa. The observance had enormous propaganda value. Tamil children 
    being taken to view Vesak decorations was symbolic of reconciliation. However, 
    ten of them were massacred by soldiers who were not restrained even by an 
    occasion sacred to them, and the Government covered it up. It is against such 
    an atmosphere that one-sided slogans about <i>'Crimes against the entire Tamil 
    motherhood'</i> are given publicity by Tamil opinion makers.</p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText>At the same time the Tamil newspapers operate in a ghetto 
    where they, quite legitimately, report at length on violations by the State 
    that receive scanty coverage in other newspapers. They use this as a pretext 
    for a righteous indignation where they justify the LTTE and attack those who 
    question it as traitors and quislings. The Tamil people have thus been prevented 
    from questioning their own sepulchral leadership. The few who dare to do so 
    are marked and picked off by the LTTE when a suitable pretext arises.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>There are thousands of examples; we take up one 
    that should be recorded. Cheliyan Perinpanayagam of Batticaloa was a journalist 
    and Tamil literary figure. At the height of state terror in the early 1990s, 
    Cheliyan performed yeoman service as a member of the Batticaloa Peace Committee 
    and was involved in documenting disappearances. In this Cheliyan showed himself 
    a man of courage with a concern for his people. Later he took to politics 
    and became mayor of Batticaloa. He was assassinated by the LTTE in the run 
    up to the October 2000 General Elections for which he was a PA candidate. 
    If being a PA candidate were a crime, one only needs to look at the UNP MP 
    for Jaffna, whom the LTTE has nothing against. He made his fortune by proving 
    his resourcefulness in the trade between Colombo and the embargoed North. 
    Cheliyan lived and died a man of very modest means.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Indeed, the people of Batticaloa gave their verdict 
    by electing a PA representative and punishing the TULF. What the LTTE had 
    against Cheliyan must be sought elsewhere. He once poured out his mind: <i>&quot;Thamby, 
    people here do not suffer only because of killings by the Sri Lankan forces. 
    The LTTE too often kills people for the flimsiest of reasons. Were not they 
    too sons of Tamil mothers? When the LTTE came to Batticaloa in December 1989 
    with the help of the Sri Lankan Army, as the Indians withdrew, they killed 
    300 Tamil youths. They were innocent boys, mainly TNA conscripts. Their bodies 
    were taken away in municipal garbage trucks. It was so tragic, so painful.&quot;</i></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>These are events in the history of its innate 
    sadism which the LTTE would like to suppress. A fault in Cheliyan from the 
    LTTE's point of view is that he had a conscience. The LTTE would have known 
    from its informants a long time ago that Cheliyan reflected in this vein, 
    and was hence a 'traitor'.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>The outcome is that the ordinary Tamil people 
    are silenced by a process involving both the State and the LTTE. The former 
    in a way that is mindlessly arrogant for transient ends, but the LTTE in accordance 
    with a set agenda. This being so, the practical way out of this embroglio, 
    appears in the first instance, to push the State to observe a rigorous respect 
    for human rights. That will place far clearer options before the Tamil people.<a

  <h3><a name="_Toc519425452"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
13.5pt'>8. Human Rights Monitoring: The Challenge</span></a><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt'><o:p></o:p></span></h3>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Based on hindsight, when a major violation by 
    the security forces occurs, the Government's first line of action seems to 
    be denial by the Deputy Defence Minister. In the event that the pressure is 
    persistent, the President steps in and orders a controlled inquiry. Although 
    this creates a dilemma for the Human Rights Commission that is appointed by 
    the President, it need not be, and one trusts that it is not, bound by such 
    constraints. Unlike other groups whose activism is <i>ad hoc</i> the HRC has 
    the institutional stature and the resources to make a benignant impact. The 
    challenge of human rights activism is to understand the process - the fatal 
    conjunction - through which human rights are violated, and to counter that 
    process. This as we have pointed out has to be done by challenging primarily 
    the State.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>It is in this spirit that some questions have 
    to be placed before the HRC. We understand that the HRC did not go into the 
    Vesak Day tragedy in Batticaloa because the recorded evidence was contradictory 
    and they feared becoming conveyors of LTTE-instigated propaganda. But such 
    an approach would cripple the HRC. It would amount to an admission that they 
    are unable to make judgments and penetrate behind the reality of the Tamil 
    community. This the London-based Amnesty International has done quite successfully, 
    and has hardly ever been proved wrong. This also means that the HRC has not 
    been able to find reliable local contacts. The Batticaloa Peace Committee 
    (BPC) has after all built up its credibility over many years as a mine of 
    reliable information.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>It was the BPC working with international organisations 
    that pursued the Sathurukondan massacre of 9th September 1990 where 184 villagers 
    were massacred. Comparatively, the material evidence was slim. There was only 
    the direct testimony of a confused and traumatised villager who survived the 
    massacre with grievous injuries. Apart from this, there was testimony from 
    other villagers who were witness to the Army taking away the victims. The 
    Army destroyed the evidence when Amnesty International pressed the Defence 
    Ministry for an inquiry. However, the Human Rights Task Force under Justice 
    Soza in 1993, and the North-East Disappearance Commission headed by Justice 
    Palakidnar in 1997, heard evidence and accepted the massacre as a fact. Both 
    named some of the officers involved. We too spoke to several of the bereaved 
    villagers in 1991 (our Report No.8).</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>By comparison, as we have pointed out, the material 
    evidence for the Vesak Day massacre is strong. If the HRC does not look into 
    it, some future commission is likely to come along and find that the Army 
    was responsible. If Fr. Jeyachandran's testimony recorded by the Police in 
    Colombo Hospital is a problem, a Commission can always ask Bishop Swamipillai 
    or Fr. Miller what he had told them immediately after the massacre from Batticaloa 
    Hospital, and make its judgement. </p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>In some notable respects the situation today is 
    an advance on that which prevailed ten years ago. At least, rather than recording 
    massacres and disappearances alone, we are talking about shortcomings, indeed 
    grievous ones, in the legal process, because in most cases now there is one. 
    For example, disappearance of the two women mistreated in Mannar would have 
    been more convenient for the CSU. As with the Jaffna disappearances, a government 
    can go on looking for missing persons until they are out of office and play 
    innocent as the UNP has done. Today there appears to be some inhibition against 
    disappearance or outright murder. But, when murder did take place, as with 
    rape victims Sarathammal and Carmelita who did not live to testify, the Government's 
    response has been far from convincing (see our Bulletin Nos.: 21 of July 1999&nbsp; 
    and 22 of January 2000) .</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Nevertheless, how much credit for improvement 
    can be given to the PA government is uncertain because of its obstructive 
    approach. Even the earlier UNP government from about 1992 had to implement 
    measures to safeguard human rights. The issue of receipts for arrest had been 
    quite firmly established when the PA came to power. The next step was to bring 
    in penalties for the failure to issue receipts. However, during the mass disappearances 
    in Jaffna no receipts were issued although people asked for them. This meant 
    that an order had been passed down from the top not to issue receipts. There 
    is today a gap between the work of commissions that looked into disappearances 
    during the UNP era and the present work of the HRC. The disappearances in 
    Jaffna in 1996 have not been gone into.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>The HRC cannot ignore it. The HRC must at least 
    submit a preliminary report and call for the appointment of a separate commission. 
    The testimony collected from the accused in the Krishanthy Kumarasamy case 
    by Mr. T. Suntheralingam, a member of the earlier Human Rights Commission, 
    has not been pursued. We need to place on record who orchestrated these disappearances 
    and who gave instructions not to issue receipts (see our Special Report No.12). 
    The families in need of relief should not kept waiting any longer.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>A particular problem concerning safeguards is 
    that given the discretionary powers enjoyed by security officials, legal accountability 
    can be overridden and restored at pleasure as happened in Jaffna in 1996. 
    We have seen magistrates and medical officers too easily succumbing to their 
    will. Thus important links in the legal process have become fragile. It requires 
    positive remedial action to restore the autonomy of their roles. The needless 
    and mindlessly bureaucratic controls exercised by security officials over 
    the movement and residence of Tamil civilians should be examined carefully. 
    Such measures should not discriminate against one community.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>The State has become so heavy-footed in its dealings 
    with the Tamil people that there is an alarming absence of reciprocity or 
    even courtesy. The <i>Daily News</i> quoting Police HQ reported on 14th June 
    that the security personnel identified in the rape of Sivamani and Vijikala 
    could not be produced in court in Mannar on 24th May because the CID after 
    its fashion discovered an LTTE plot to kill the suspects. As though to thicken 
    the &#145;failed&#146; plot, the Police added that two Tigers had come to 
    town and asked a police woman if the suspects were being brought to court. 
    The police woman with singular presence of mind answered that she did not 
    know! Mannar town is no less secure for judicial proceedings than any other 
    town under government control. At this rate the security forces can argue 
    that they cannot stay in Mannar because there is a threat to their security! 
    Has anyone in the Government raised a single query of concern for innocent 
    Tamils who are detained and shoved from one place to another without any concern 
    for their welfare or security? Indeed, a large number of them have been killed, 
    tortured and raped in police stations and army camps, and massacred even in 
    a rehabilitation centre. In several important areas there is no reciprocity 
    and the Tamils have no rights, no justice. To the practical man, the Mannar 
    case is closed.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>This is again part of a pattern. The first thing 
    to have done after the Bindunuwewa massacre of 25.10.00 was to interdict the 
    SSP whom the HRC found to have been telling tall stories. This was not done. 
    Again the delay in judicial proceedings was inexplicable. The Foreign Ministry 
    press release cited earlier reported the disclosure by the Attorney General 
    and DIG CID on 11.5.01 that the assistance of a foreign laboratory had been 
    sought &#145;<i>to conduct DNA tests to scientifically ascertain the identity 
    of <b>some</b> (our emphasis) of the victims</i>&#146;. This was a novel ruse 
    in Sri Lanka&#146;s legal history. There&nbsp; was no shred doubt about who 
    the 27 victims were and the testimonies of survivors had been compiled exhaustively. 
    Then a state radio bulletin on 2<sup>nd</sup> July 2001 (8 months after the 
    event) said that it has been decided to send blood samples to India for DNA 
    testing to expedite the case. So uncharacteristically meticulous!</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>In Colombo, a Tamil going to a police station 
    to register, can go through the experience of being interrogated at length 
    in public view by a police sergeant, and being finger-printed, like ordinary 
    criminals and drug peddlers (<i>kudu karayas</i>) who are routinely brought 
    in. Sometimes the police officer rubs it in by dividing his attention between 
    the two categories. The landlord of the Tamil is warned to be responsible 
    for the good behaviour of his tenant or face unpleasant consequences. </p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>This procedure gives no respect to position. This 
    is just the surface of attitudes that betoken far graver abuses. We recently 
    had the case of a 27 year old Tamil woman whose case came up before the Supreme 
    Court in March. She was badly tortured at Negambo police station, first by 
    being severely assaulted by policemen, and then having an object coated with 
    chillie powder inserted into her vagina. Since then similar mistreatment of 
    two woman at Bambalapitiya police station in the heart of Colombo has come 
    to light. Then in the night of 23<sup>rd</sup> June, 3 soldiers and 3 policemen 
    took for questioning a Tamil woman, whose address they had obtained when she 
    passed a checkpoint in Colombo's commercial district a few hours earlier. 
    They then gang-raped her at the checkpoint and threatened her with death should 
    she report it.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>A related matter that may escape attention in 
    the case of the two mistreated women in Mannar is the question of the detention 
    order. In this instance her detention order appears to have been signed by 
    a superior officer - even the SP was covering up. The officer issuing the 
    detention order should be identified and punished in the event of the detainee 
    being tortured. The frequency of abuse calls for strong measures. What happened 
    in Mannar is important, because it gives the clearest evidence of the implications 
    of the system. Its inherent brutality transforms into black comedy when the 
    magistrate accedes to the request for continued detention of the victim, after 
    he is presented with proof of gross mistreatment without a shred of evidence 
    of the victim's guilt.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>However, after 20 years in this school of burgeoning 
    disaster and losing their ability to think, the security forces would insist 
    that they need more impunity to fight terror. Ironically, the PA government 
    that has been more committed to a political settlement than its predecessors, 
    would have been in a far stronger position to deal with the LTTE, had it been 
    more firmly committed to human rights.</p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText>One of the reasons for the present impasse is the Government's 
    inability to discipline itself. A number of times since the Joel Pera murder 
    of 1997, the Government has used the Police to shield the transgressions of 
    its members and cronies. Notable here are election abuses and the problems 
    of the Deputy Defence Minister&#146;s son.&nbsp; How can the same Police act 
    as a thinking force when dealing with Tamils? Finally, we deal with the implications 
    of these developments for peace.<a href="#_Toc519425443"> [Top]</a></p>
  <h3><a name="_Toc519425453"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
13.5pt'>9. Implications for Peace</span></a><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt'><o:p></o:p></span></h3>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Many who have lost faith in this country's ability 
    to solve its problems have started speculating on a foreign or Western conspiracy 
    behind this country's ills. The Norwegian peace effort too is seen in this 
    light. However, we can blame only ourselves for our failure to advance two 
    essential remedial measures. One is our failure to uphold human rights, and 
    the other, the failure to implement an acceptable political settlement. The 
    UNP's undermining the PA government's constitutional proposals was a piece 
    of short-term opportunism that will not take them anywhere.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Without these essential measures, the political 
    battle for a united Sri Lanka is lost. Once that is lost, the military effort 
    too would in time run aground. An army that finds itself fighting without 
    a clear objective, merely having to go on until someone puts a stop, and resented 
    by the people whom it is supposed to protect, would lose its morale. Having 
    lost faith in their task, officers and defence officials would remain contented 
    making hay while the sun shines. Several of the incidents above show the effects 
    of this demoralisation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>What talks under the present dispensation hold 
    out for the Tamil people is contained in one outstanding fact. Both parties 
    have formed a common interest&nbsp; in suppressing investigations into violations. 
    Two sets of graves were uncovered in Jaffna during the period of the Chemmani 
    excavations in mid 1999, the other set being in Duraiappah Stadium. Today 
    there is a mutually congenial silence on both. Whoever was responsible for 
    the skeletons at the Stadium, the LTTE does not want skeletons being dug up.</p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText>So far there has not been the slightest hint that human 
    rights and democracy for the Tamils will play any role in the Western-backed 
    talks between the Government and the LTTE. It is a singular pathology of these 
    talks that the Tamils have to worry about the standing of the Government. 
    Whether the Government is good, bad, reasonable or unreasonable would all 
    be largely immaterial if the LTTE were a liberation group with its credentials 
    to negotiate on behalf of the Tamils not in question. In their own contexts, 
    no one questioned the ANC's and the PLO's credentials to negotiate. These 
    groups were mass-based structures. Whence the international recognition they 
    gained was not based on their political claims alone. Despite the violence 
    of their struggles, being mass-based, their political arms retained the capacity 
    to assert ascendancy. The LTTE on the other hand asserted its ascendancy via 
    terror within its own community and is politically vacuous.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>It is the Government's poor standing that has 
    enabled the LTTE to hide its true disposition and pass itself off as the one 
    and only representatives of the Tamil people. Mahattaya (see 6 above) was 
    not trying to be sensational when he said that only 5% of the Tamil people 
    support the LTTE. He and all other LTTE leaders knew right along that the 
    people had rejected them and only fascist coercion can maintain a show of 
    support.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>As to what the LTTE wants from negotiations is 
    confirmed by what journalists have heard from LTTEers who have recently been 
    captured by the Army. Children in the age group 13 to 15, some of them forcibly 
    recruited, had been told as an inducement that they need not face the Army. 
    What they need to do is to destroy the Army with artillery from a distance 
    and walk in! From the testimony of a girl of 15, she and the 3 others who 
    joined from the same school after a propaganda meeting desperately wanted 
    to get back to their mothers. They had been planning to desert. The other 
    3 had succeeded. A boy of 14 forcibly recruited into the elite Charles Anthony 
    Brigade had deserted 12 times and was 12 times brought back. In the so-called 
    Border Force, adult men with enforced rudimentary training had been forcibly 
    parted from their wives and mothers and placed on the frontlines as sitting 
    ducks. These reflect the same trends reported in our earlier bulletins. These 
    are crimes against humanity by any standard.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Clearly, what the LTTE wants from negotiations 
    is to be allowed, as the minimum, free movement in the army-controlled areas, 
    especially Jaffna, to apply its well-known coercive methods and recruit young 
    persons. One argument adduced in favour is that in a cease-fire backed by 
    the Western nations and India, foreign monitors will be here to prevent abuses.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>The TULF vocally advocates a Western-backed ceasefire 
    and has accused the Government of betraying the Tamil people, even after shamefully 
    reneging on its support for the Government&#146;s constitutional proposals 
    last August. </p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>The question was put to a senior TULF leader, 
    <i>&quot;If you let the LTTE into Jaffna under a ceasefire and they start 
    abducting dissidents and taking away children from schools, who is going to 
    inform the foreign monitors?&quot;</i> The leader replied that civil society 
    has to rise up to the occasion and play the role. He was asked, <i>&quot;What 
    civil society is there left among the Tamils? Even you, the leading Tamil 
    party, have been unable to issue a statement stating that your Batticaloa 
    MP Nirmalan Sounderanayagam was murdered by the LTTE. How can you expect people 
    living among the LTTE to report its abuses?&quot;</i> The leader said quietly 
    after a pause, <i>&quot;Yes, many of our leading members were killed by the 
    LTTE, but we have not said so.&quot;</i> When monitoring by civil society 
    was acknowledged as impractical, a suggestion came from the same quarters 
    that Military Intelligence could inform the foreign monitors!</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>One could hardly find a more novel description 
    of the plight of the Tamil people. Here we have the tragicomedy of veteran 
    Tamil nationalists envisaging a replacement of Tamil civil society with the 
    &#145;enemy&#146;s&#146; Military Intelligence.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>The TULF clearly know what would happen if the 
    LTTE were turned loose and have absolutely no idea on how to prevent it. Their 
    public positions are utterly irresponsible by the Tamil people they claim 
    to represent. Do Norway and the other Western nations or India have any better 
    ideas up their sleeve? We think not. Allowing the LTTE into Jaffna will be 
    murder - blue murder. It will end up with the monitors washing their hands 
    and a new and bloodier round of war.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Dealing with and monitoring a group whose existence 
    crucially depends on continued violations has to be clearly thought out. Two 
    recent instances exemplify this. On 8th November 2000 the LTTE murdered Soundaranayagam 
    who received the largest preference vote in Batticaloa. Pro-LTTE elements 
    pointed at the Government as the killer. Tamil journalists and the TULF knew, 
    but said nothing. </p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>The LTTE has long resented the work of Christian 
    ministers from the independent church groups, particularly in areas under 
    its control. Their upholding pacifism as integral to the Gospel message has 
    threatened LTTE recruitment. In a first move of its kind, the LTTE in the 
    company of local thugs went to the house of Sivanesarajah on the night of 
    2nd May and took him out. He was beaten, cut with a mamotty and shot dead. 
    Sivanesarajah (21) was the leader of a local church group of the Assembly 
    of God in Panichchankerni, near Vakarai, and had ignored LTTE-backed threats 
    to stop holding meetings. Other church leaders decided not to talk about it, 
    and the murder of a leader in this very backward area remained suppressed 
    for more than a month. The LTTE has succeeded in making people believe that 
    silence is the most judicious means to dealing with them, or it might get 
    worse.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>The problem in this country has been so badly 
    mishandled that there is no guaranteed road to peace. There is no doubt that 
    we all want an end to war, but that does not mean that we should turn our 
    back on hard-won experience. Agreeing to temporary ceasefires without taking 
    into account the reality within Tamil society, and without any hold on the 
    LTTE to ensure its movement towards political negotiations, is a recipe for 
    disaster. </p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText>The challenge of&nbsp; achieving peace and upholding human 
    rights straddles many crucial issues and dilemmas. There is no simple formula 
    at hand and the debate goes on. The argument that an emphasis on human rights 
    would prolong the conflict and not achieve peace is advanced at one end of 
    the spectrum. It is argued at the other extremity that ignoring human rights 
    in the interests of peace-at-any-cost will lead to instability, through keeping 
    the baneful tendencies intact. This happened in Sierra Leone. We do accept 
    that in the real world politics is not governed by higher values and conflicts 
    are manipulated by many vested interests. But we do hold that violations by 
    state forces, and for that matter by non-state forces, fall into a variety 
    of qualitative levels. The qualitative nature of the state, or non-state, 
    force in question needs to be understood clearly to influence it or to make 
    it accountable. Nor could there be meaningful conflict resolution without 
    such understanding. Our own elucidation of the nature of the LTTE and the 
    political character of Tamil civil society is not done with any malice. The 
    challenge of advancing human rights needs to take account of the salient socio-political 
    factors that influence human behaviour and its creative and destructive potential. 
  </p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText>The environment among the Tamils is one where many who 
    resist the collective debasement of humanity and advance healthier political 
    alternatives are silenced by the LTTE&#146;s terror. Even more, they are frequently 
    devalued and disregarded by those who profess fidelity to human rights, democracy 
    and peace. The core internal issues that are crucial to the survival of the 
    community are not touched by the Tamil media, which like all other sectors 
    has made a virtue of playing extremely safe. Even most international monitoring 
    organisations and media watchdogs, who are blind to the extent of internal 
    terror, treat every item that makes news in isolation. Hence the crippling 
    dynamism of internal terror, which also disfigures reality, is given the status 
    of a legitimate expression of an oppressed people.</p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText>Human rights activism must thus address and challenge the 
    conjunctive process of violations by both the State and the LTTE. It must 
    also work towards changing the political and ideological milieu of the two 
    communities that has made peace a mirage.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>We could say with certainty that the promising 
    first step is to force the Government to clean up its act and be seen to stand 
    up for higher principles. If that cannot be done, there is little hope. At 
    the same time it would be a grave error to gloss over the qualitative distinction 
    that marks LTTE&#146;s politics. It is synonymous with the suicide cult, child 
    soldiers, and war and devastation without end.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>In view&nbsp; of this reality, the other nations 
    who have taken it upon themselves to restore peace in this country have a 
    duty to make it clear that they are committed to democracy and human rights 
    for the Tamil people. Further, if they advance a particular course as a risk 
    worth taking, would they share in the risk themselves?<a href="#_Toc519425443">
