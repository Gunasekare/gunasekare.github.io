<h4><a name="_Toc515538659"></a><a
name="_Toc515540255">1.1 A Question of Accountability</a></h4>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The July offensive in Jaffna is the first major military 
  thrust undertaken by the PA Government. The Government was pledged to higher 
  standards of accountability and was in its twelfth month in office. It is therefore 
  of practical relevance to ask whether the people of Jaffna saw a qualitative 
  difference in the attitude of the Government and the behaviour of the forces?</p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The short answer is : very little. </p>
<h3><a name="_Toc515540256">The Armed forces:<u1:p></u1:p></a></h3>
<p>To begin with the Army had for some days prior to the July 9<sup>th</sup> operation 
  distributed leaflets at Thandikulam check- point to north- bound travellers. 
  These merely instructed people to take refuge in schools and places of worship 
  in the event of a military operation. Few in Jaffna were aware of this.</p>
<p>Following the commencement of the operation on the 9<sup>th</sup> morning, 
  the radio repeated the call to go to places of refuge. But the intensity and 
  indiscriminate&nbsp; nature of the shelling was such that this call was irrelevant. 
  There was nothing to suggest that the shelling respected places of refuge. The 
  intensity of the shelling was such that people who had intended remaining in 
  the areas, and had done so during previous operations, fled for the first time 
  with their families with shells falling around them. About 130 civilians died 
  in shelling alone during the first few days when there was hardly any resistance 
  from the LTTE. Those who visited the injured in hospital said that the injuries 
  were qualitatively more severe this time. The one surgeon attached to Jaffna 
  Hospital,and his assitant, together with a handful of doctors and medical staff, 
  rendered yeoman service working round the clock to deal with the masses of surgical 
  cases and amputations.There was also high intensity shelling outside operational 
  areas including Navaly and the Manipay hospital area. It was obvious that the 
  artillery units were ignorant of, and oblivious to, places designated for civilian 
  refuge. </p>
<p>If this was not bad enough, even more unpardonable was the attitude of the 
  Air Force. The bombing in Navaly was not just the slip of one&nbsp; individual 
  pilot, but, as we demonstrate later, the long standing practice of the institution. 
  Artillery gunners may be careless or incompetent in the matter of identifying 
  places of refuge on their field maps. In the matter of bombs which were dropped 
  around Navaly church, the pilot could not have missed seeing the church. But 
  he dropped his cluster of bombs apparently to hit one LTTE vehicle in the area. 
  This was an old habit, and the pilot does not seem to have received any instructions 
  about civilian interests. </p>
<p>Significant measures had been taken, such as sending monitoring groups, to 
  check the behaviour of the Army. But this too made little impact since shelling 
  had driven most peope out of the area, and few actually encountered the troops. 
  But strains in the attitude of troops were beginning to show after the LTTE 
  counter - attacked on the 14<sup>th</sup>. </p>
<p>The measures taken, however, were not entirely adequate to&nbsp; prevent troops 
  from looting civilian property. On the testimony of civilians the looting was 
  done by soldiers, some poorer sections of the local population who did not go 
  far from their areas , as well as by the LTTE. The latter seem to have taken 
  advantage of the expectation among civilians that the Sri Lankan Army will loot. 
  There is therefore little room to commend the army as having been disciplined, 
  although there was a qualitative change. </p>
<p>The operation was therefore, as in the past, conducted with little thought 
  given to the civilians, the ground reality and to the predictable behaviour 
  of the LTTE. The civilian reactions to the operation were determined primarily 
  by the experience of shelling and the aerial bombing of refugees at Navaly. 
  <a href="#_Toc515540252">[Top]</a> </p>
<p><b><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>The Government</span>:</b> </p>
<p>The president was informed of the aerial bombing of refugees near the church 
  by the llth, both by the ICRC and the Bishop of Jaffna. Her initial reaction 
  of expressing sympathy had a positive side to it. She also appealed for authentic 

  information and called for an inquiry. But her taking cover behind saying that 
  the armed forces were unable to investigate since the area was outside their 
  control, was an admission of weakness. It also implied that the Government had 
  no communication with the people of Jaffna, no way of finding out what was going 
  on there, and could trust no one, not even its Government Agent. </p>
<p>From this point the handling was almost entirely negative and alienating to 
  the people of Jaffna. The Foreign Minister and government officials picked a 
  quarrel with the ICRC on a formality concerning the issue of a statement on 
  the true plight of civilians caught up in the offensive. The official media 
  publicity which was laced with fiction obfuscated the plight of civilians,and 
  even tried to blame solely the LTTE for what happened at Navaly Church. </p>
<p>When the Government and the media started making play of the fact that the 
  Navaly Church was physically intact, contrary to some careless reporting, nothing 
  could have been more alienating to civilians who saw the bomber dropping the 
  bombs and then people being killed - about 65 in all. </p>
<p>The official claim that the military operation was one to liberate the people 

  of Jaffna from the clutches of the LTTE could not have failed to strike&nbsp; 
  a sardonic note. The claim implied that the Government had legitimacy among 
  the people of Jaffna. Although the Government&#146;s legitimacy had been continuously 
  eroding from&nbsp; the late fifties, it was&nbsp; totally lost by the time the 
  Jaffna Public Library was burnt in 1981. The real task of the Government is 
  to win back that lost legitimacy. To that end it needs to show that&nbsp; every 
  aspect of its activity is geared towards that goal, particularly during a military 
  operation. </p>
<p>From the reimposing of the ban on several goods immediately after the LTTE&#146;s 
  unilateral violation of the cessation hostilities, to the recent Operation Leap 
  Forward,the experience of the people was that even this Government which had 
  seriously talked about peace was not concerned about their welfare. The last 
  operation was both of short duration and with next to no fighting around civilian 

  concentrations. Yet the random shelling and bombing had taken a heavy toll of 
  civilian casualties. How would things be when the Army moves for the second 
  time where significant Tiger resistance is expected? <a href="#_Toc515540252">[Top]</a></p>
<h3><a name="_Toc515540257">1.2 Fiction, Reality and Alienation<u1:p></u1:p></a></h3>
<p>An ICRC statement issued from Geneva on llth July referred to the military 
  operation which commenced in Jaffna on 9<sup>th</sup> July as involving &#145;intensive 
  artillery shelling and air strikes which forced tens of thousands of civilians 
  to leave the area&#146;. The statement added later:&#148;According to eye -witness 
  accounts, this church [of St. Peter &amp; St. Paul at Navaly] and several adjacent 
  buildings were hit by further Air Force strikes at 4.30 P.M, the same day. During 
  the attack 65 people were killed and about 150 wounded, including women and 
  children&#148;. </p>
<p>On the basis of testimonies received independently by us, the statement issued 
  by the ICRC was accurate as concerning the plight of the civilians and the harm 
  done to them. It is this that mattered most. Subsequently the Government made 
  play of the ICRC&#146;s breach of protocol and what emerged later, that the 
  church building did not receive a direct hit and was largely intact. Of course 
  among those killed were several people in the church compound. At a press conference 
  in August this month the President said in response to a question that the church 
  is almost intact and that she was awaiting details on civilian casualties. </p>
<p>On the other hand the military spokesman, during the course of the operation, 
  quoting &#145;intelligence reports&#146;, said that about 130 civilians were 
  killed when an LTTE ammunition truck exploded. The Government which could still 
  not confirm the number of civilian casualties at Navaly was confidently coming 
  out with the number of civilian causalities attributed to the accidental LTTE 

  blast, which it&nbsp; repeated for several days. Even a Sri Lankan diplomat 
  in London claimed this figure in a BBC interview. But to the people in Jaffna 
  it was a cruel joke. Indeed there was such an explosion in the Thavady area 
  and only about six persons were killed, all of them to be presumed LTTE cadre!. 
</p>
<p>on 20<sup>th</sup> August the Sunday Observer and Sunday Times gave publicity 
  to an ICRC report on the incident with photographs released to the press by 
  Operational Head Quarters. Defence officials used the photograph of a crater 
  to facilitate further evasion. It was suggested that bombs aimed at an LTTE 
  convoy triggered off &#145;sympathetic explosions&#146; in underground LTTE 
  ammunition dumps, and&nbsp; it was these that claimed most of the lives. </p>
<p>The ammunition dump theory is based on a crater in an ICRC photograph&nbsp; 
  being about 6 feet deep and 15 feet in diameter. To people in Jaffna this is 
  nothing very remarkable given their long experience of aerial bombing. They 
  have seen so many craters of this kind resulting from&nbsp; aerial bombing. 
</p>
<p>Take some instances in the recent history of aerial bombing.Two places of refuge 
  which where bombed are Thurkkai Amman Temple Tellipalai in July 1992 and St.James&#146; 
  Church Jaffna in November 1993. Then we have, the maternity ward of Killinochchi 
  hospital in November 1993 and St.Theresa&#146;s school Killinochchi bombed several 
  times during 1993 but without casualties,although on some occasions the school 
  was in full session. The reason behind all these was evidently that an LTTE 
  vehicle or establishment was close by. </p>
<p>In the case of St.James&#146; Church the current Air Force chief admitted in 
  a press interview where he pledged to fight a &#145;clean war&#146; that the 
  target was an LTTE vehicle. In the case of the hospital the target was a tank 
  captured by the LTTE at Pooneryn. All these are instances where the target was 
  missed and, in most cases civilians killed. The Navaly bombing falls into this 
  pattern. If pin-point accuracy is claimed, why drop a cluster of bombs to hit 
  a vehicle in a residential area?&nbsp; The performance of the Air Force represents 
  therefore, as we mentioned earlier, an unchanging, tradition. </p>
<p>Shelling again was indiscriminate and the noise was described&nbsp; as a continuous 
  and loud drum-beat. A&nbsp; number of shells fell wildly, far outside the operational 
  area and the army&#146;s positions. Shells fell in Navaly , Uduvil, near the 
  Kokkuvil Hindu College refugee camp, one near a shop in the Jaffna Hospital 
  protected zone and around Green Memorial Hospital in Manipay - including several 
  near the Swedish run children&#146;s home, Elim House, in Memorial Lane.One 
  falling inside the hospital on 10<sup>th</sup> July caused severe damage to 
  the back portion of the nurses quarters.&nbsp; More than a hundred civilians 
  were killed as the result of shelling. Several people who were running towards 
  Jaffna town from their homes were killed&nbsp; by shelling on the way. </p>
<p>The next time the Army marches in there are going to be several more minefields 
  and more bunkers to harass the army.&nbsp; It must also be kept in mind that 
  the principal reason for the civilian casualties during the Indian Army&#146;s 
  advance into Jaffna in 1987 was because the troops were un- nerved by land mines 
  and by small numbers of LTTE cadre remaining to harass the Indian Army as it 
  moved into civilian areas, before running away. </p>
<p>If the Government deems it necessary to go ahead with another operation, it 
  should be frank with the people of Jaffna on what they are to expect and is 
  moreover duty bound to persuade them that the steps taken to safeguard their 
  welfare are serious ones. The ICRC is there for such a purpose and should be 
  used to the full.The whole strategy centred around aerial bombing and random 
  shelling needs to be re-evaluated on the basis of human suffering, political 
  aims, military effectiveness and ground realities.These matters cannot be allowed 
  to be determined by the Military alone as it has cornered itself into a brutal 
  culture resulting from the&nbsp; politics of the past. <a href="#_Toc515540252">[Top]</a></p>
<h3><a name="_Toc515540258">1.3 The operation of 9the July: Some salient features<u1:p></u1:p></a></h3>
<p>The operational area was the north- western sector of Jaffna peninsula, west 
  of the extended Palaly base from which the troops set off at 5.30 AM on the 
  9<sup>th</sup> morning, Sunday. One column marched close to the north coast 
  through Moolai and Ponnalai, and the other through Alaveddy and Sandilipay and 
  then westwards through open areas; leaving Uduvil, Manipay and Navaly about 
  two miles to the south, all of which were shelled. The two columns made a rendezvous 
  in Vaddukoddai on the 11<sup>th</sup> and made a brief foray into Araly to the 
  south. The area enclosed was about 27 square miles. </p>
<p>The initial part of the Army advance was without incident. In areas close to 
  Pandeteruppu, people woke up to find the army already there. Some saw soldiers 
  on their way to church. They were reassured and not interfered with. Many children 
  had already left for Jaffna town on bicycles in the early hours of the morning 
  for their tuitions. Subsequently civilians too began leaving. </p>
<p>The curfew was announced by radio at 6.00 AM and subsequently the shelling 

  commenced. People were asked by radio to seek refuge in schools and places of 
  worship. By mid-morning shelling had claimed casualties around Navaly which 
  was five miles&nbsp; away from advancing troops. A huge exodus to Jaffna from 
  places as distant as Pandeteruppu included parents with clothes and books for 
  their children who were then told that they cannot return home. </p>
<p>People are in general unsure as to why the LTTE as expected made no serious 
  move to resist the Army advance. What in fact it was doing was to dismantle 
  its camps and shift its property. In Manipay for example which the LTTE expected 
  the Army to enter, but which the Army bypassed while moving west, the LTTE was 
  seen removing goods from places fled by their owners. It was subsequently reported 
  that much of the property was returned in areas where the army had not entered. 
  Equipment, including computers, removed from the Jaffna College Technical Institute, 
  for which the Army was initially accused, were later recovered from the LTTE. 
  The LTTE had no past record of eagerness to protect civilian life or property. 
</p>
<p>The experience of the Jeyasingam family of Navaly gives a picture of the trauma 
  undergone by many people living in and around operational areas. Jeyasingam 
  arrived at a place of refuge in Jaffna town with his wife, son and three daughters. 
  Jeyasingam then went back to Navaly alone to attend the funeral of his sister 
  and her husband who had been killed by shelling that morning. He then went to 
  his house close to the Navaly church near which bombs fell that evening. Next 
  morning the son arrived from Jaffna town to discover that his house had been 
  bombed. The mangled body of his father lay in the compound. To spare the rest 
  of the family that sight, he swept the compound, performed the last rites for 
  his father, and then went to town to inform the rest of the family. The coming 
  week he sat for his A-Level examinations. </p>
<p>According to an eye witness, a young girl who was in Navaly when the bombs 
  were dropped, the first impression on seeing the cluster of bombs was that leaflets 
  were being dropped to guide the civilians. She then heard the voice of a man, 
  &#147; They are bombs, lie down !&#148; She escaped by throwing herself flat 
  on the ground. Those who had remained inside the church escaped. Among the casualties 
  were those who ran out of the church, those lounging under trees in the compound, 
  those engaged in cooking for the refugees in the compound, and refugee families 
  in the vicinity travelling southwards, who were just arriving. There were also 
  three Grama Sevakas who had come on official duty to prepare a list of refugees 
  so as to distribute government rations and had meanwhile gathered people&nbsp; 
  around them. Many of them were among those killed along with the Grama Sevakas. 
  It is therefore not, as has been made out, misleading to say that the church 
  was bombed if one was concerned about the people rather than a material structure. 
</p>
<p>We have mentioned that troops were comparatively disciplined in their encounter 
  with civilians. It was from Vaddukoddai that we got definite testimony that 
  the Government has instituted some praiseworthy measures in the matter of troop 
  discipline. With the army arrived an independent group in mufti. This group 
  moved among civilians and became friendly with them. Their purpose was to monitor 
  the conduct of the troops and obtain public reactions. The LTTE&#146;s counter-attack 
  on the 14<sup>th</sup> night in the Sandilipay - Alaveddi area under cover of 
  pitch darkeness caused confusion among the troops. The casualties were placed 
  at well over 50 dead. Government troops however re- established control in the 
  morning, in the course of which an LTTE fired missile brought down a Puccaro 
  bomber. This event it appears influenced the decision to withdraw the troops 
  from most of the areas brought under Government control. The decision to withdraw 
  caused puzzlement among troops according to civilians in those areas. </p>
<p>In Vaddukoddai, the main body of troops pulled out suddenly and the group that 
  came to monitor them, to their surprise,found themselves alone. A lone LTTE 
  cadre on a spying mission in the area encountered one of the monitoring group, 
  fired at him with his revolver and missed. He then ran away. The monitors knowing 
  that they had little time left, ran for their safety and got away. It had also 
  been reliably reported that many in Vaddukoddai prayed for their safe get-away. 
  The LTTE was later said to be annoyed when the people told them that the troops 
  had been well-behaved.</p>
<p>Two instances reported to us are a pointer to the limitations in troop behaviour. 
  Shortly after the LTTE counter-attacked, soldiers told civilians who had taken 
  refuge in a temple in Sandilipay that next time something happened, they would 
  all be killed. Later they locked the temple door with the people inside and 
  left. The people were rather shaken by the whole experience. At Ponnalai the 
  withdrawing troops took some civilians as cover. After going some distance&nbsp; 
  they asked the civilians&nbsp; to stay in a temple and moved on. The civilians 
  came out a few minutes later when a volley of shells fired from the direction 
  in which the troops had withdrawn, fell near the temple. It is not known whether 
  this was a parting shot at the civilians or a measure to dissuade the LTTE from 
  following the troops. </p>
<p>When the troops briefly visited Araly, people in Jaffna, 5 miles away, found 
  it difficult to believe that the Army was so close. Those seeing troops passing 
  Araly sub-post office on television first thought that the film was shot 11 
  years ago. Viewing Sri Lankan television programmes is officially banned. But 
  a privileged few with generators view government broadcasts on the sly. People 
  were generally aware that the LTTE had counter -attacked on the 14<sup>th</sup>&nbsp; 
  and that the troops had regained their positions within a few hours. But the 
  following week the people were soon aware that troops had vacated most of the 
  area by Monday 17<sup>th</sup> July. It appeared to them that the military spokesman 
  had an unusual sense of humour when he went on announcing for another week that 
  the troops were in control of the 7 miles by 4 miles strip, were re- establishing 
  civil administration, and were strengthening their positions. </p>
<p>Of the original area taken, the troops retained a small portion at Alaveddy. 
  Shelling of adjacent areas and occasional incursions continued. At the height 
  of the operation those estimated to have been displaced numbered 300,000. By 
  19<sup>th</sup> July, GA/Jaffna said that 95% of those displaced could return. 
  The LTTE too recommended this. But in general those with the means moved closer 
  to Jaffna town. In areas such as Chunnakam people spent the day at their home&nbsp; 
  in Chunnakam to protect their property where they could also collect firewood 
  from their compounds for cooking and move to homes of friends or relaties nearer 
  Jaffna, such as in Urumpirai, for the night. The reason being shelling and army 
  incursions which are more frequent at night. It was very hard on students doing 
  their A.Levels who went about with bottle lamps looking for places where they 
  could sit and study. The examination in two centres around Chunnakam was disrupted 
  by military activity. <a href="#_Toc515540252">[Top]</a></p>
<h3><a name="_Toc515540259">2. Manipulation of the Civilian Population<u1:p></u1:p></a></h3>
<p>The experience of the military operation, particularly bombing and shelling, 
  has enabled the LTTE to drum up the threat of a genocidal attack by the Sri 
  Lankan forces to enforce repressive demands on civilians. It found it difficult 
  to go this far before the July offensive. Public resistance to recruitment of 
  school going children has fallen off after the offensive. A new round of extortion 
  has commenced. </p>
<p>In our earlier reports we have described how the regime imposed by the LTTE 
  on the people of Jaffna has strengthened its tentacles through using the vanity, 

  opportunism and self-interest of leading sections of society. Among the latter 
  have been bishops, leading academics and top officials of the church. During 
  the peace process earlier this year they contributed to discrediting the Government 
  in the eyes of the Tamils, and justifying whatever the LTTE did that was calculated 
  to stir up doubts among the Sinhalese and strengthen the chauvinists on both 
  sides. </p>
<p>During the peace talks some of them repeated verbatim the LTTE&#146;s position 
  about Tamils wanting their &#145;fundamental rights&#146; before entering talks 
  on a political solution. Other statements by this group were to the effect that 
  the Tamil people were one with the Tigers, &#145;Violence could be a form of 

  charity&#146; and following the outbreak of war in April, the &#145;Morning 
  Star&#146;, a church journal, commented editorially that when God is creating 
  a new nation no one could stand against it. </p>
<p>Two BBC interviews by the Vicar- General of the Roman Catholic diocese of Jaffna 
  are instructive about what this group and their allies the world - over are 
  doing to the Tamil people. The first interview given to the Tamil Service was 
  soon after the LTTE broke the ceasefire in April. He said what is the point 
  in talking and talking when the Government has shown bad faith in not allowing 
  or obstructing unbanned items from coming through. The Government had admitted 
  that there were delays in the government machinery which could be resolved given 
  a little time. The Vicar General said in effect that the Tamil people had no 
  choice but to resort to war. Anyone knowing the Tamil people knew very well 
  that war was the last thing they wanted and that the Sri Lankan forces in war 
  were gong to bomb and shell civilians as they had done in the past. <br>
  &nbsp; <br>
  After the July offensive, the Vicar General returned to Colombo in August and 
  was on the BBC again. This time he was full of sorrow for the Tamil civilians 
  whom he never consulted when&nbsp; he earlier averred by implication that they 
  were for war. He described helpless and vagrant civilians going from place to 
  place and seeking out bridges to sleep under, so as to escape the shelling during 
  nights. </p>
<p>The LTTE itself countenanced no opinion from the people when it resumed the 
  war. But during the third week on August it got civilians in Jaffna to take 
  out a procession to the Government Agent&#146;s secretariat calling upon the 
  Government to stop the war&nbsp; and send the food supply. This was about the 
  time LTTE spokesman Balasingham was making noises about re-starting negotiations. 
</p>
<p>One could here, as in other instances, see a close connection between the LTTE&#146;s 
  military and political designs for of the moment (the latter being&nbsp; slave 
  to the former), when the Tamil pubic is allowed to and not allowed to express 
  its opinion ( which is always for peace), and when the Tamils&#146; elite spokesmen 
  wear their nationalist war-mongering cap and when they wear their pastoral or 
  humanitarian cap. This politics thus thrives by robbing the people of any semblance 
  of dignity. </p>
<p>In helping to debase the people, the servile elite who aid the LTTE are themselves 
  trapped and debased. Having rhetorically identified the people with the LTTE, 
  what is a bishop to say to the Government when a church is bombed and people 
  are killed, or if the Army had run amok and killed some priests and people in 
  the church after the LTTE killed five soldiers by firing from the roof of St. 
  Sebastian&#146;s Mannar ( which the Army fortunately did not do)? They have 
  strayed far from their role of preserving public values and defending the people. 
</p>
<p>In turn the society becomes trapped at all levels. A debilitating conformity 
  is imposed to the cost of the conscience and the intellect. It takes an exceptionally 
  strong person to stand up, and what that may cost needs no exaggeration. Take 
  for instance the&nbsp; recruitment of children and particularly minors for military 
  activity. The vast majority feel it is wrong. Those with children live in a 
  state of grave anxiety. There is a trend towards rationalising military service 
  to the LTTE as part of services demanded and required by the state, without 
  posing the deeper questions about the true nature of this war and where it is 
  leading to. In fact the society has passed the threshold beyond which it lost 
  its ability to preserve sanity. It has moreover built around itself a politico-military 
  machinery which is totally geared towards acquiring maximum destructive power 
  by any means. The fatalism may be compared with what prevailed in Nazi Germany 
  even when its approaching end was all too evident, up to when teen- aged Boy 
  Scouts were drafted in to defend Berlin. </p>
<p><b>2.2 Implications for the young</b> </p>
<p>When we speak of rising and falling levels of recruitment by the LTTE, it becomes 
  easy to overlook a crucial fact. The LTTE has moulded society through a mixture 
  of terror, persuasion and patronage into one of actual or formal complicity. 
  Its voice is ubiquitous. Even the young who are cynical and unconvinced have 
  no voice to guide them, no guiding hand from their elders, teachers or religious 
  leaders and no place of refuge in a closed society almost behind bars. Like 
  with game animals in a park the LTTE has almost the ability to pick them up 
  at will through appropriate persuasion, preying on their pride, self- respect 
  and fear. Once in they are trapped. <a href="#_Toc515540252">[Top]</a></p>
<h3><a name="_Toc515540260">2.2.1 Current recruitment by the LTTE<u1:p></u1:p></a></h3>
<p>Following the July offensive LTTE recruiters entered an A. Level tutory in 
  Jaffna and began their harangue very much in the manner of a religious meeting. 
  Among the students was a prefect from St.John&#146;s College, a promising student 
  who had obtained seven distinctions in the O-Levels. As the meeting progressed 
  this student broke out into sweat,as if going into a trance. He removed his 
  watch and chain, passed them on to be delivered to his parents, and joined the 
  LTTE. </p>
<p>Once he comes to know the stifling and perverting nature of the movement at 
  close quarters it would be too late. He could best survive by giving his mind, 
  body&nbsp; and soul to the Leader as demanded by oath and becoming blank. This 
  blankness is the common feature of LTTE cadre performing astounding feats that 
  are eulogised as dedication. </p>
<p>Another recent revealing case is that of a Black Tiger being trained in Jaffna 
  to live in a civilian environment posing as a student. Even the LTTE police 
  who picked him up&nbsp; a couple of times on suspicion and released him knew 
  nothing. In the house he was boarded, the people only noticed that he often 
  failed to light his lamp and lay down on his bed. He rarely spoke to others. 
  One day he felt rather lonely perhaps, and confided to the girl of the house 
  whom he called Acca (elder sister), that he was a Black Tiger from the East. 
  He was fluent in Sinhalese. About 10 boys from the East were living in the area 
  like him, he added. Likewise there were boys form Jaffna taken elsewhere. The 
  reason was to prevent their families from seeking them out and interfering. 
  He went daily to an LTTE camp where he was blind-folded and taken to a secret 
  location. Here he was administered his oath of absolute fidelity and surrender 
  to the Leader and later returned to the first camp.He had nothing to say about 
  what motivated him or why he joined such a dreadful unit. He added almost as 
  an apology that he would not be around long as he would be assigned a mission 
  and sent to the South. </p>
<p>These Black Tigers are the ones who are trained to live in a civilian environment 
  and&nbsp; carry out their ultimate task. Others who are in the camps are likely 
  to be used in suicidal attacks against military targets in the battle zone. 
</p>
<p>Compared with June this year,when spontaneous resistance to recruitment of 
  children from parents and teachers was on the rise, there has been a marked 
  change after the July offensive.[See: Briefing No.2]. The case of the Navaly 
  bombing is a telling instance of how the state aids the LTTE. A prominent banner 
  has now been strung across elevated points in the slightly damaged church structure 
  inviting recruits to the LTTE&#146;s anti-aircraft unit. After the Operation 
  the screws had been tightened. The teachers had been ordered to keep away when 
  they addressed students unless they would positively promote recruitment. Each 
  school is visited again and again to force the numbers up. One case is that 
  of St.Patricks&#146;s College, from which about 50 students had recently been 
  recruited, with reportedly over twenty from one class at a single meeting and 
  nine on another occasion. </p>
<p>The new programme proceeds like this: The propaganda unit walks into a class, 
  and a stirring speech is given followed by the screening of a video. Three Black 
  Tiger women are shown going before the Leader for their final blessing. The 
  Leader parts with them and his heart is grievously heavy. The women are then 
  interviewed, where they state why they are willingly going to their death. The 
  reasons are to save their soil and to enable others to live in freedom. The 
  women then walked away from the camera, becoming smaller as they went, marching 
  into eternity. </p>
<p>A new voice then came in to announce gravely, &#147;Twenty four hours later 
  our comrades were no longer with us in this world ...&#148; and their sacrifice 
  was eulogised. The camera then turned to the scene at Navaly Church that was 
  bombed by the Air Force. Distraught women and children were shown mourning over 
  the dead.Those who had seen the film said that it was very effective. In due 
  course an appeal was made for volunteers. A few expressed readiness. The rest 
  were then harangued and asked whether they would like to be cowards while others 
  sacrificed their lives for them. &#147; Do you think you could study and stake 
  out your future&#148;?, the speaker went on,&nbsp;&nbsp; &#147;When the Sri 
  Lankan Army comes in, your studies will not help you...&#148;. the number of 
  volunteers kept increasing. The speaker threw in a bonus, &#147; Your studies 
  will not suffer if you join us. We will arrange tuition for you in the camp...&#148; 
  The volunteers went out as the rest remained with a feeling of guilt, perhaps 
  to be worked on successfully another day. </p>
<p>Then Fr.Bernard, the rector of St.Patrick&#146;s told the LTTE men that he 

  is responsible to the parents of the students while they are in school. He said 
  that they could take them provided the students first went home and told their 
  parents of their intentions. The LTTE men disagreed. They then got the volunteers 
  to write letters to their parents as instructed by them. These letters and their 
  bicycle keys were given to the helpless Rector, and the students were taken 
  away. </p>
<p>There is also the unusual phenomenon this time of a significant number of recruits 
  of an older age group from the Jaffna University. This was directly related 
  to the nature of the recent operation. It could also be noted that the reasons 
  for joining are almost entirely all negative. What tipped them over are stimuli 
  of short term duration. Blank minds are inherent to the nature of the cause. 
  Not long after, thoughts of escape arose in several minds. </p>
<p>According to information supplied by escapees, Meesalai is one of the areas 
  to which new recruits were taken. This is a coconut plantation area in Thenmaratchi. 
  Escape meant creeping under barbed wire and running for it while vigilant sentries 
  set off the alarm. Some escapees had been hidden by well wishers. Those caught 
  escaping were tied to a tree and whipped as an example to others with similar 
  intentions. Some who volunteered mysteriously returned to their schools. These 
  are believed to be cases where the parents had special influence with the LTTE. 
</p>
<p>Once news of a son or daughter joining reached the home of the recruit, the 
  atmosphere often changed to one of a funeral house. Women cried their hearts 
  out, their wails piercing the silence of the night. There was no corpse, no 
  priest, no comfort from institutional religion. The soul which prompted the 
  mourning was still earthbound, but in all likelihood beyond hope. The life of 
  the family was inexorably disrupted. A son or daughter on whom the family reposed 
  their hopes for advancement or even survival, and on whose education they had 
  spent ill- affordable resources, had been taken away. It was not the honourable 
  decision of a mature mind that they had to come to terms with. They knew in 
  their heart, although they could not say it, that their son or daughter, sister 
  or brother, had been tricked. But what a stark contrast it provides to the life 
  of the people who live outside the North-East and especially abroad, who advocate 
  the cause of the LTTE in various forms! </p>
<p>We must address ourselves urgently to the plight of the people&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  living in an environment of terror, created by both the State and the LTTE. 
  This is necessary for anyone who wants to play a role in creating permanent 
  peace in this country. But to explain or justify the activity of the LTTE without 
  any reference to people&#146;s well being,&nbsp; may eventually lead to the 
  total destruction of the Tamil community in the North-East. The Sri Lankan polity 
  as a whole too may then become irremediably brutalised. <a href="#_Toc515540252">[Top]</a></p>
