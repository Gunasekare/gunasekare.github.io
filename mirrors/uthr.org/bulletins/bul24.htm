<h1><a name="_Toc515622133"><span lang=EN-GB><u1:p></u1:p><u1:p></u1:p>Introduction<u1:p></u1:p></span></a><span
lang=EN-GB></span></h1>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>People from all communities and from 
  all parts of the country have been through many horrors and ordeals from the 
  time the flames of conflict engulfed this country in July 1983. But seldom has 
  anything been so prolonged and full of constant terror and anxiety as what several 
  thousands of people in Thenmaratchy, the south-eastern sector of the Jaffna 
  peninsula with Chavakacheri as its main town, endured for three weeks and more. 
  The war, the fortunes of the adversaries, and the underpinning politics tend 
  to be discussed in isolation from the suffering of the people who are most affected 
  by it, and the trials they go through. Their desires, immediate needs and their 
  long term interests have ceased to matter. We, in this bulletin, try to highlight 
  areas neglected in the reporting, and throw light on how the people were perceived 
  by the adversaries - the LTTE and the government forces.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>Many may regard the details as no 
  more than a part of war. But these bring out the true plight of the people and 
  their role in the whole process. They also underline the suffering of the LTTE 
  cadre and government soldiers who are war-weary and are trapped in the workings 
  of deadlocked political ideologies. We in this country have become too used 
  to discussing solutions to the problem in the abstract and have not touched 
  the imagination of the people.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>Indeed, the extent of indifference 
  to what is happening on the ground is shocking. Here was a situation where thousands 
  of civilians were living for several weeks with shells falling among them and 
  with no authentic information coming out. Both sides have got used to twisting 
  individual incidents of civilian tragedy to their advantage in their propaganda, 
  and little verification is possible. The shelling of the Elders&#146; Home in 
  Kaithady is a case in the point.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>The disregard for reality is also 
  evident in the political process and in how it is reflected by editorial writers 
  and columnists. Political leaders and opinion makers on both sides have shown 
  themselves incapable of breaking the vicious cycle of violence. Recent events 
  in Parliament and outside it saw the forces of reaction coming together in a 

  dance of death to ensure that this country would continue to bleed. In general 
  the foreign and local media represented the withdrawal of the constitutional 
  proposals presented by President Kumaratunge as a humiliation for the Government. 
  But the fact that even these diluted proposals could not be passed by Parliament 
  is an ignominy inflicted on all the people of Sri Lanka rather than on a particular 
  party or leader.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>The pettiness which runs through all 
  walks of life, in religious orders, in political discourse, and among many who 
  are thought to be members of intellectual think-tanks and radical activists, 
  evinces a pathology in this country&#146;s social and political life. The lack 
  of originality and creativity it entails, breeds a vicious politics that carries 
  us towards the precipice. Recent events in Thenmaratchy which followed the fall 
  of Elephant Pass showed the system close to breaking point.<u1:p></u1:p><a href="#_Toc515622132">[Top]</a></span></p>
<h1><a name="_Toc515622134"><span lang=EN-GB>The Unseen Ordeal<u1:p></u1:p></span></a><span lang=EN-GB></span></h1>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>In the three days from 18<sup>th</sup> 
  May, the LTTE advanced from Kaithady in the west towards Chavakacheri without 
  any resistance. Tens of thousands of people found themselves under LTTE control 
  overnight. They were mainly in the areas of Navatkuli, Kaithady, Nunavil, Mattuvil 
  and Chavakacheri West.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>The Army regrouped at Sarasalai and 
  resisted. There was a heavy rain of shells into the areas overrun by the LTTE 
  and the LTTE then attempted to move the civilians into the Vanni mainland. Knowing 
  the consequences of this, an overwhelming bulk of the civilians resisted this 
  in varying contexts. A large number of men and women who never sought to do 
  anything remarkable in life, performed feats of endurance.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>About 21<sup>st</sup> May when the 
  LTTE tried to push the Army back from Sarasalai in the Chavakacheri area, the 
  area was saturated with shell-fire and the LTTE advance was stalled. But the 
  harrowing experience of civilians in the area has gone unrecorded. Here is the 
  account of Dharshi, a young lady:<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><i><span
lang=EN-GB>&#147;We took refuge in an Amman Temple. Shells were falling all round. 
  Krishna, Varathan and Jeevan were in a sea of blood. We all screamed and cried. 
  We then ran to the Sivan Temple. In view of a similar situation prevailing there, 
  we thought we would stay the night and leave at dawn. However, when we were 
  all asleep, several shells struck the Sivan Kovil one after the other, shrouding 
  us in acrid smoke. Having nowhere to run, we all went into the inner sanctum 
  of the temple. In the morning we left behind the belongings that we had brought 
  along, and went on foot to Mattuvil with D Annai&#146;s family. Further, Ramanan, 
  Mohan and Ruban had gone with some injured persons, to leave them somewhere 
  safer. They did not return, and we do not know what became of them.<u1:p></u1:p></span></i></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><i><span
lang=EN-GB>&#147;At Mattuvil, we took shelter with Busman Gnanam. While we were 
  there, Punitha and the eldest daugher of the Ambal Pharmacy owner were brought 
  and left at the house opposite. They both passed away. Father and D Annai took 
  them in a bullock cart and cremated them in an empty field. Deciding that it 
  was not safe there, we moved [west] to Kaithady-Nunavil, dug ourselves a huge 
  bunker under a tree and covered it with 26 slices of coconut stem. We stayed 
  there while shells fell here and there around us. We could only plead with the 
  Almighty.<u1:p></u1:p></span></i></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><i><span
lang=EN-GB>&#147;Then my &#145;akka&#146; (elder sister) who was expecting started 
  having labour pains. There is nowhere father and D Annai did not go looking 
  for a midwife. No one agreed to come. We waited in prayer. Two married &#145;akkas&#146; 
  agreed to come. At mid-night when shells were falling everywhere, I went and 
  asked them to come. In spite of my pleading they refused. I cannot blame them 
  for refusing to move from their bunker when shells were falling.<u1:p></u1:p></span></i></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><i><span
lang=EN-GB>&#147;When my sister was expecting, I had taken some lessons at the 
  &#145;union&#146; and had a blade with me. We all cried and prayed. It struck 
  me forcefully that we must trust God rather than man. The baby came out. I felt 
  my courage return. I cut the umbilical chord. Immediately my mother and Chellamma-akka 
  wiped the babe. The babe opened its eyes and it was beautiful. But, my poor 
  sister, although the babe was born at 12.32 AM on 27<sup>th</sup> May, the placenta 
  had not fallen by 6.00 AM.<u1:p></u1:p></span></i></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><i><span
lang=EN-GB>&#147;My poor father went hither and thither with shells falling about 
  him and came back with a young LTTE medic. By then many had seen my sister and 
  said that she would not survive. But my prayers were answered. The medic put 
  on his gloves and promptly extracted the placenta from my sister. He administered 
  her saline in the bunker itself and went away. On the same day we travelled 
  to the Vanni with only the clothes we were wearing and the babe swaddled in 
  old clothes. It was the medic who offered to take us to the Vanni.<u1:p></u1:p></span></i></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><i><span
lang=EN-GB>&#147;I keep looking at the papers for news about Uncle. I had asked 
  him to come. I feel very sad. Atputhakka&#146;s mother and Kili died when a 
  shell fell on Sivan Kovil. Suppiah&#146;s two daughters and niece too died. 
  The entire family at Mangala Stores in Thanankilappu were killed. So many have 
  died....&#148;</span></i></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>This young lady&#146;s family moved 
  to the Vanni and lead a life of privation, relying on meagre charity handouts. 
  Without their bicycles or transport, they cannot even move about. They do not 
  even have slippers to walk, which they left behind when they fled Amman Kovil. 
  Overnight their world had collapsed and they were rendered helpless destitutes. 
  Having on hand an infant and a mother who narrowly escaped death and needed 
  medical care, which only an institution could provide - and there were only 
  one - the family had no choice but to go to the Vanni. But the vast majority 
  tried to avoid this.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>One group of families in Nunavail 
  got together at a place of worship and constructed trenches. One set was for 
  living, another for cooking and another for their ablutions. They lived in this 
  manner for nearly 3 weeks with shells falling around. The greatest risk was 
  when going from one trench to another.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>All this time the LTTE was offering 
  them transport and trying to inveigle them to move to the Vanni. They were deterred 
  from moving elsewhere. On 10<sup>th</sup> June again the shelling became unbearably 
  heavy. The LTTE allowed them to leave and the entire group went to the <i>&#145;tharavai&#146; 
  </i>and crossed the mostly dry lagoon bed to Neervely and the army-controlled 
  area. (<i>&#145;Tharavai&#146; </i>refers to land that is saline and uncultivable 
  and in this case refers to the part of Kaithady North, facing Valikamam.)<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>Again for many who resisted going 
  to the Vanni and later crossed no-man&#146;s land into the army- controlled 
  area, it had been a harrowing experience. Some had seen the person next to them 
  being killed, and often people in the neighbouring house being killed. In such 
  instances, they had to perform the last rites as best as they could. It was 
  many weeks later, after the survivors had trekked into the army-controlled area, 
  that one could get a fair idea of who died and who was alive.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>This extra-ordinary catastrophe involving 
  tens of thousands of people raises many questions of a political and humanitarian 
  nature. Some of them do not seem to have been anticipated in international conventions 
  (e.g. Protocol II of the Geneva Conventions pertaining to internal conflicts).<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>A particularly important question 
  applies to the Sri Lankan Government and Army. The Army was controlling the 
  area and protecting citizens of this country on sovereign territory. But when 
  the Army withdrew from certain parts, it shelled the civilians treating them 
  in effect as part of the enemy on enemy territory. The contingency had neither 
  been thought through nor answers found beforehand. It is notable that in about 
  half a dozen instances, or more, civilians taking refuge in Hindu Temples had 
  been killed by army shelling. Ever since the Government designated temples, 
  schools, and churches as places for refuge at the commencement of Operation 
  Liberation in May 1987, civilians have gone to them in times of crisis.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>However hazardous the security situation, 
  measures taken for the safety of civilians should have been raised in Parliament 
  and defence officials made answerable, so as to reaffirm these measures. This 
  does not happen in the Sri Lankan Parliament and it is partly the fault of the 
  Tamil representatives. We will first sketch the developments from the beginning.<u1:p></u1:p><a href="#_Toc515622132">[Top]</a></span></p>
<h1><a name="_Toc515622135"><span lang=EN-GB>Early Preparations<u1:p></u1:p></span></a><span lang=EN-GB></span></h1>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>During December 1999 in the run up 
  to the presidential election, the LTTE shelled several areas along the south 
  of the peninsula from across the lagoon, including Chavakacheri and the eastern 
  suburbs of Jaffna town. A part of the aim was to influence the voters whom it 
  urged to vote UNP. Also where the shells fell was carefully monitored by infiltrators, 
  so as to determine gun settings for different locations.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>During the same month the LTTE took 
  some strategic locations on the east coast near Elephant Pass and also much 
  of the sparsely populated Kerativu and Ariyalai salients, which were separated 
  from Pooneryn by a short stretch of the lagoon, and were dangerously close to 
  Jaffna town. These gains were left uncontested. The gap between Sangupiddy and 
  Pooneryn was formerly covered by a ferry service, and the logistics would have 
  posed no problem for the LTTE.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Following the fall of Elephant Pass, the LTTE&#146;s 
  progress towards Jaffna from the south-east was decisively blocked after a 
  battle at Kilaly on 5<sup>th</sup> May. Abandoning this route, on 10<sup>th</sup> 
  May, the LTTE attempted to advance on Jaffna via the Thanankilappu-Kerativu 
  and Ariyalai salients. The Army withdrew from Navatkuli junction, leaving a 
  stretch of the A9 in LTTE hands.<u1:p><span lang=EN-GB><a href="#_Toc515622132">[Top]</a></span></u1:p></p>
<h1><a name="_Toc515622136"><span lang=EN-GB>The Advance towards Jaffna<u1:p></u1:p></span></a><span lang=EN-GB></span></h1>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>Just afterwards the LTTE attacked 
  the eastern defences of Jaffna about 3 miles east of the city going southwards 
  from the Bo-Tree junction in Chemmani. Fighting was heavy with the LTTE using 
  cannon. The LTTE tried to make up for smaller numbers by making effective use 
  of cannon - two of which were in use. The Army pulled back to a new line in 
  Colombagam. How heavily the LTTE had committed itself in this offensive is revealed 
  by the fact that it lost 55 cadre on the very first day.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>The LTTE&#146;s attempt to breach 
  Jaffna&#146;s defences went on for three days before it was abandoned. Despite 
  having the resources, the Army made no concerted attempt to retake Navatkuli 
  and push the LTTE back across the salient. It was a bad period just after the 
  fall of Elephant Pass and the Army appears to have been thinking of preventing 
  the LTTE from landing and making new inroads elsewhere. An attempt to advance 
  from Nagarkovil to Pt. Pedro was a distinct possibility. But from a logistical 
  point of view the Kerativu salient was very convenient.<u1:p></u1:p><a href="#_Toc515622132">[Top]</a></span></p>
<h1><a name="_Toc515622137"><span lang=EN-GB>The Advance on Chavakacheri<u1:p></u1:p></span></a><span lang=EN-GB></span></h1>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>During the three days when the LTTE tried to move towards 
  Jaffna, it had free use of the two salients to induct fighters and materials. 
  The LTTE had staked a lot on taking Jaffna town and its overseas propaganda 
  even announced its capture. Despite heavy casualties the event did not materialise. 
  Having failed to take Jaffna town, the LTTE turned its attention in an easterly 
  direction. Its first target was Navatkuli followed by Kaithady junction, a strategic 
  location held by the Army. The resources and concentration the LTTE put into 
  this operation can be judged from the fact that it was directed by the LTTE&#146;s 
  leading military commanders:- viz. Colonels Banu, Sornam, Karuna, Jim Kelly 
  Thattha and Theepan; and Lt.Col. Vidusa, a woman.<u1:p></u1:p></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>Among the commanders in the field 
  were Lawrence, Mahendi, Robert, Parani, Pushpan, Senkolan, Illampirai, Thamayanthy, 
  Kapilan, Gnanatheepan, Arul, Umaran, Suman, Anbu, Mervyn, Illanthirai, Kuhan 
  and Dinesh. Among the women leaders were Keerthana, Priya, Kantha, Latha and 
  Thilaha. The attempt to overrun Jaffna was led by Lawrence and Mahendi who were 
  from Jaffna. 1500 cadre or more appear to have been involved in the operation.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>According to LTTE sources (e.g. Tamil 
  Net and its journal Erimalai (Volcano)), the Army withdrew from Kaithady on 
  17<sup>th</sup> May after an engagement lasting 12 hours. From the point of 
  defending Thenmaratchy, this was a major setback for the Army. <u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>Testimony received from civilian sources 
  said that the LTTE shelled the Kaithady area and advanced from the west (along 
  A9) and from the south (i.e. the Thanankilappu area). They reached Kaithady 
  junction late in the night on the 17<sup>th</sup>. The army personnel who were 
  west of the junction in the Elders&#146; Home and Nuffield School area, moved 
  on to the Kopay road, north-west of the junction. They withdrew from Kaithady 
  North to Kopay during the 18<sup>th</sup> morning. The remaining army positions 
  were east of the junction towards Chavakacheri. At Kaithady itself the Army 
  offered very little resistance. This is of some importance for the incident 
  taken up below. <u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>According to other civilian sources 
  from near Chavakacheri, they saw truckloads of soldiers being dispatched towards 
  Kaithady. Some time later they saw soldiers running back in disarray, having 
  discarded some of their accoutrements. It would follow from this that despite 
  the Army&#146;s manpower, Kaithady was lost because a section of the soldiery 
  did not want to fight. This was a major problem faced by the Army at that time. 
  There was also another reason in Thenmaratchy.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>Curfew was imposed on 10<sup>th</sup> 
  May soon after Navatkuli came under attack. On the 12<sup>th</sup> curfew was 
  lifted for 3 hours. Owners of commercial establishments in Chavakacheri brought 
  lorries into town to remove their goods. The Army prevented them saying that 
  they would not quit Chavakacheri and some of those who came to remove their 
  goods were assaulted. A large number of their lorries were commandeered. This 
  had an adverse effect on the morale of the soldiers, which was already low. 
  They got it into their head that the Army command had decided on total withdrawal.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>This is evident from the fact that 
  soldiers started stopping civilians and commandeering push cycles and motor 
  cycles. Civilians tried to avoid riding on the streets or if necessary took 
  a woman passenger along. Once running away was uppermost in the minds of the 
  soldiers, they lost interest in fighting. The result was disastrous both for 
  themselves and the civilians.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>From Kaithady the LTTE advanced towards 
  Chavakacheri in two columns. Jim Kelly Thattha led the column along the Mattuvil 
  road from Kaithady North and Theepan (a native of Vanni) moved along the A9 
  trunk road. The column that went to Mattuvil was able to fire mortar shells 
  at Army positions on A9 to the south from the interior. The Army abandoned camps 
  on the A9 and pulled back towards Chavakacheri without offering resistance.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>The abandonment of Kaithady was to 

  prove a great setback to the Army by leaving the interior areas exposed. Kaithady 
  was by contrast situated in open space that was easy to defend. Advancing east 
  through Mattuvil from Kaithady North, the LTTE was able to surprise the Army 
  at Pandiththalachchi on the Kanagampuliyady-Puttur Road on the 19<sup>th</sup> 
  morning. An army convoy of several trucks carrying injured soldiers was followed 
  by two armoured vehicles. The Army had not expected the LTTE so soon. The LTTE 
  let the trucks pass and attacked the two armoured vehicles, killing 13 soldiers. 
  Kanagampuliyady is a strategic junction of five roads north of Chavakacheri.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>The Army fought for the bodies of 
  the soldiers and heavy fighting erupted. There was heavy shelling of the civilian 
  areas of Mattuvil, Kerudavil and Kalvayal from which the Army had already withdrawn. 
  By losing Kaithady, further to losing the Jaffna (Kandy) Road, the Army lost 
  two other important link roads to Palaly and Valikamam. These were the Kaithady-Kopay 
  Road and the Chavakacheri-Puttur Road. The Army is now solely dependent on the 
  Kodikamam-Nelliady Road leading to Vadamaratchy.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>By 20<sup>th</sup> May, civilians 
  in Nunavil, Mattuvil and Chavakacheri West suddenly found themselves under LTTE 
  control. In one part of Mattuvil, LTTE women came to civilian homes at dawn 
  and asked for mammotties and baskets to build trenches. In general civilians 
  were confidently told to dig trenches and manage for two days, after which the 
  fighting would have shifted eastwards and they would be safe. Others were advised 
  to move to Manthuvil and Varany and come back in two days.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>In the meantime the Army too had been 
  planning its new defence line. From Kanagampuliyady, Sarasalai, the Army withdrew 
  south to Chavakacheri Ladies College on the 19<sup>th</sup> and redeployed themselves 
  in the former area the next day. Under Jim Kelly Thattha the LTTE massed to 
  attack Sarasalai. The area was then saturated with shells fired from Palaly 
  (Achchelu). 68 LTTE cadre were killed. (15 of the bodies are said to have been 
  taken to Jaffna Hospital, of which 11 belonged to women.) This effectively halted 
  the LTTE advance.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>Before withdrawing a short distance 
  to the north from Chavakacheri on the 19<sup>th</sup> night, the Army had looted 
  the shops in Chavakacheri town, from which it had earlier prevented most of 
  the owners from removing their goods. They also removed fuel stocks from the 

  MPCS. Among the establishments said to have been looted by the Army are Sri 
  Vigneswara Stores and RMS (Rasam Mills Stores). What remained was looted by 
  the LTTE after they entered Chavakacheri town on 20<sup>th</sup> May. In Chavakacheri 
  Base Hospital, a single doctor, Gnanasuthan, was attending to the patients, 
  several of them with shell injuries. A shell fired by the Army fell in the hospital. 
  Everyone who could move scattered. That was the end of the civilian presence 
  in Chavakacheri.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>The Army line was now protected by 
  a bund some distance along the Vannatthipalam road towards Puttur to the north-west, 
  through Sarasalai and then by-passing Chavakacheri Hindu College, crossing the 
  Kandy Road at Sangathanai just east of Chavakacheri and then south to Allarai. 
  Despite a few advances by the Army, the lines have not changed much since then. 
  Realising that its advance was checked, the LTTE launched the next option - 
  evacuating the civilians to the Vanni. We will return to this after looking 
  at an incident that also tells us how each side manipulated the news.<u1:p></u1:p><a href="#_Toc515622132">[Top]</a></span></p>
<h1><a name="_Toc515622138"><span lang=EN-GB>The Singular Fate of Kaithady Elders&#146; 
  Home<u1:p></u1:p></span></a><span lang=EN-GB></span></h1>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>Apart from the tragedy itself, the 
  particular relevance of this incident is that it is an illustration of the deplorable 
  attitude of both sides towards the safety of civilians. On 17<sup>th</sup> May, 
  the LTTE organ Tamil Net, announced the capture of Kaithady and the Government 
  was charged with malicious propaganda for claiming that the LTTE had been shelling 
  populated areas in Jaffna.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>On 21<sup>st</sup> May, both the Tamil 
  Net as well as the Government media reported the shelling of the Old People&#146;s 
  (Elders&#146;) Home at Kaithady. The Government&#146;s 6.00 PM SLBC Tamil News 
  accused the LTTE of using civilians as shields and said that the military were 
  taking special measures to protect places of worship and charitable institutions 
  such as orphanages. Although nothing specific was said, there was a strong hint 
  that its forces had hit a sensitive civilian target. However 165 minutes later, 
  the 8.45 PM SLBC English news said that the LTTE had hit the Old People&#146;s 

  Home killing 15 elders and injuring 24. The Colombo Press reported it the next 
  day saying that the shelling of the Home by the LTTE took place on the 20<sup>th</sup>. 
  It was not generally known in Colombo that from the 18<sup>th</sup> the Home 

  was under LTTE control.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>By contrast the Tamil Net&#146;s handling 
  of the incident was very professional. It quoted <i>&#145;aid agency sources 
  in the north&#146;</i> as saying that artillery shells had hit the Old People&#146;s 
  Home on Friday 19<sup>th</sup> May and that 15 elders were killed and 31 injured. 
  It added that the Sri Lankan Army had been shelling the general area of Kaithady 
  heavily after the LTTE overran its positions around this junction town on 17<sup>th</sup> 
  May.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>It was a perfect report. But those 
  who had been following Tamil Net with a critical eye would have noticed that 

  the TN had lost no time in announcing the LTTE&#146;s capture of Kaithady. But 
  it took apparently two days for it to report the shelling of the Elders&#146; 
  Home and the LTTE is never slow in exploiting an event of propaganda value. 
  There were no &#145;aid agencies&#146; there to report the incident. The LTTE 
  which feeds the Tamil Net were the only agency there. The ICRC got there more 
  than two months later. We shall see that there was some truth in the claims 
  of both the Government and the LTTE and both were suppressing much. It is seldom 
  in a war of this intensity that the world is so blind to what is going on.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>We received persistent reports from 
  responsible persons that the Old People&#146;s Home was shelled by the LTTE. 
  This seemed at variance with what was reported by both sides. What seemed a 
  straightforward inquiry about dates of shelling and casualty figures elicited 
  what were at first sight contradictory responses. An attendant who was at the 
  Home said that on 17<sup>th</sup> May the Kaithady area was shelled from the 
  general direction of Maravanpulavu (i.e. from behind LTTE lines) and shells 
  were falling everywhere. About noon, one shell fell on the Home, and he knew 
  for a fact that four elder women were killed. The staff then fled the Home, 
  after which the elders were on their own. He had heard subsequently that the 
  Army had shelled the Home on the 19<sup>th</sup>, killing about 19 elders.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>Another inquiry from some elders, 
  now at Moolai, Valikamam North, while not contradicting the attendant&#146;s 
  testimony, also reported, puzzlingly, that the elders generally blamed the LTTE 
  for what happened. <u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>In a further inquiry by other persons 
  who went to Moolai, they got talking to a relatively young and steady elder, 
  who told them that 17 elders were killed when the LTTE shelled the Home on the 
  17<sup>th</sup> and three were killed when the Army shelled the Home on the 
  20<sup>th</sup>. He sent away another elder who came to listen saying that he 
  was talking something private. He had been in Kaithady throughout and come to 
  Valikamam in July. Interestingly, no one was trying to deliberately mislead. 
  What is given below was largely pieced together painstakingly by a dedicated 
  social worker.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><b><span
lang=EN-GB>17<sup>th</sup> May:</span></b><span
lang=EN-GB> The Army had pulled back from the surrounding areas and were in the 
  area of Kaithady at Nuffield School, the Faculty of Ayurvedic Medicine and the 
  Elders&#146; Home. At 11.00 AM a shell coming from the general direction of 
  Maravanpulavu (behind LTTE lines to the west) fell on the Elders&#146; Home, 
  killing several elders. The Army who were in the area advised the shifting of 
  the inmates. Nearly all the staff quit the place. Four deaths of women were 
  witnessed. The LTTE entered the Home after the Army left, and going by the testimony 
  of an elder, they apparently removed the dead and badly injured.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><b><span
lang=EN-GB>18<sup>th</sup> May:</span></b><span
lang=EN-GB> In the morning Mrs. E. Thurairatnam who was in charge of the Home, 
  hired a car and went to Jaffna to inform the civil authorities of the state 
  of things. The Army withdrew from Kaithady North towards Kopay later in the 
  day. <u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><b><span
lang=EN-GB>18<sup>th</sup>-22<sup>nd</sup> May:</span></b><span
lang=EN-GB> After the Army quit on 18<sup>th</sup> May, the Kaithady area was 
  subject to shelling by the Army. Several elders witnessed LTTE cadre in the 
  premises apparently also firing at army lines to the north. Several shells fired 
  by the Army, some possibly retaliatory, fell in the compound. Since no staff 
  were present, numbers and what happened when are unclear.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>A staff member, who ran away on the 
  17<sup>th</sup> and went back later, learnt that 3 elders were killed by shelling 
  on 20<sup>th</sup> May. About this there is general consensus. Apart from the 
  4 women whose death on the 17<sup>th</sup> was witnessed and the 3 who died 
  on the 20<sup>th</sup>, it was found that 11 other elders had died during 17<sup>th</sup>-22<sup>nd</sup> 
  May. There is no definite information about what happened to them. One of the 
  11 is said to have died on the 17<sup>th</sup>.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>

  which they had to cross on foot. 58 made it. 3 died of exhaustion. 3 gave up 
  and sheltered under bushes.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>

lang=EN-GB>15<sup>th</sup> July:</span></b><span
lang=EN-GB> The LTTE brought another batch of elders to the crossing point. The

lang=EN-GB>22<sup>nd</sup> July</span></b><span
lang=EN-GB>: After negotiations, the ICRC was enabled to cross no-man&#146;s land, 
  and collect the elders from a school near Kaithady. <u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>The following is the picture that 
  emerges:<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p>Number of original inmates of the Kaithady Home 189<u1:p></u1:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><u1:p></u1:p><u1:p></u1:p>The dead are accounted for 
  in the <a href="#Appendix">Appendix</a><b>.<u1:p></u1:p></b></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>According to the relatively young 
  and steady elder referred to earlier, 10 women and 4 men accepted the LTTE&#146;s 
  offer to take them to the Vanni, and two others were taken because they were 
  ill. The difference may be accounted for by persons taken earlier for reasons 
  of illness or injury. The elders in Jaffna are in very deprived conditions after 
  their ordeal in which some died. <u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>However the number of elders killed 
  by each party is not the issue. Both shelled without concern for institutions 
  protected even in conditions of war. The Appendix also gives the names of several 
  others killed in the Kaithady area during 17<sup>th</sup> to 22<sup>nd</sup> 
  May when the area experienced a <i>&#145;shell malei&#146;</i> (rain of shells) 
  particularly from the Army. The shelling seems to have stopped after the matter 
  received publicity on 21<sup>st</sup> May. Most inmates of the Home are clueless 
  about where the shells were coming from and who was firing them. A great deal 
  however remains to be explained. Why was no meaningful action taken to relieve 
  the elders during those crucial five days?<a href="#_Toc515622132">[Top]</a></span></p>

<h1><a name="_Toc515622139"><span lang=EN-GB>The Thenmaratchy Exodus<u1:p></u1:p></span></a><span lang=EN-GB></span></h1>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>The initial shelling into civilian 
  areas was by the LTTE. They had used shelling as during a conventional military 
  advance allowing the civilians to fend for themselves. Among those killed by 
  shelling during the LTTE advance were a son and a daughter of District Land 
  Officer Vellupillai of Mattuvil South. Two others were killed in the house in 
  front of his. At this time the Army was in the area.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>Once the LTTE advance was halted, 
  these same areas were shelled heavily by the Army. The LTTE announced a cease 
  fire for the 27<sup>th</sup>. LTTE vehicles fitted with loudspeakers roamed 
  the area and told the people that they cannot find safety by escaping to some 
  other part of the Jaffna peninsula because the entire peninsula was going to 
  become a war zone. The Vanni, they were told, was the only safe place for them. 
  The people were asked to proceed to a school in Kaithady from where they would 
  be given transport to the Vanni.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>This campaign was articulated by Paapa 
  and Parani from the LTTE who belonged to that area. By this time the LTTE well 
  knew that their operations were at a standstill. A few panicked and set off 
  on foot and on bicycles to Kaithady and Maravanpulavu on the Kerativu road. 
  But most people reacted differently. Those who could avoid the LTTE and move 
  to the army-controlled area did so. Some dug bunkers and stayed put. Still others 
  sought temples and churches for refuge.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>Then instead of directly asking the 
  people to go to the Vanni, the LTTE urged them to move to Maravanpulavu for 
  temporary refuge, promising them relief. They evidently calculated that once 
  people had taken that step, it would be easy to move them to the Vanni. A particular 
  experience is of interest.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>In order to avoid the shelling a number of people in 
  Nunavil went south crossing the old railroad into the rice fields and took refuge 
  in Kollankirai Pillaiyar Temple. Some LTTE cadre brought a mortar nearby and 
  fired shells towards army lines. The Army fired back. The people were left with 
  no alternative but to move west to Maravanpulavu. Such conduct on the part of 
  the LTTE has been long known to the people (see &#145;<i>the</i> <i>Broken Palmyrah&#146; 
  </i>for instances in 1987<i> </i>and also <a href="bul21.htm">Bulletin No.21</a> 
  for a similar instance in the Mannar District on 29.6.99 where the LTTE was 
  trying to force about 3000 refugees in Vidatthal Thivu into the LTTE-controlled 
  area).<u1:p></u1:p></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>While the people were at Maravanpulavu, 
  an Air Force Kfir dropped bombs and two persons were killed. 18 others were 
  injured. This was on 26<sup>th</sup> May and the 27<sup>th</sup> was the first 
  day that the LTTE moved civilians to the Vanni. About 550 people went on the 
  first day including the injured persons and their families, and they were taken 
  in about 24 tractor loads. The Air Force attacked several times, but the one 
  above was the only sortie that caused civilian casualties. <u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>The bulk of the people at Maravanpulavu 
  were unwilling to go and there were heated protests. The LTTE (Regi, Parani 
  and Pushpan were among those in charge) then let them do as they pleased. Even 
  as the Army was firing shells, these people began a trek to Kaithady and then 
  to the &#145;tharavai&#146;, before crossing the lagoon bed to the army line 
  at Neervely in Valikamam. Many others who got into the army line in Thenmaratchy, 
  used the Kodikamam-Varany-Pt.Pedro road to get into Vadamaratchy. Several of 
  these people were able to use road transport and take some of their essential 
  goods along. Several vehicles moving from the &#145;tharavai&#146; to Neervely 
  ran into marshy patches and had to be abandoned.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>After that first day when the LTTE 
  transported 550 people to the Vanni, those accepting their offer dwindled to 
  a trickle. 1000 is about the total number who took this offer. Once people had 
  been brought to Maravanpulavu, the LTTE&#146;s offer of transport appeared safe 
  and tempting. The alternative was a relatively dangerous trek. The LTTE claimed 
  that 5000 people had gone to the Vanni. But internally, the number mentioned 
  by some cadre was 1200. The ICRC has said in a statement (Sunday Island 3.9.00) 
  that more than 3000 civilians crossed into the Vanni. We learn that this is 
  based on the figures of GA, Killinochchi.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>The Council of NGOs in Jaffna has 
  given a figure of 47,000 displaced families from the recent disturbances now 
  registered in the army controlled zone, the bulk of them being from Thenmaratchy. 
  Of the estimated 100,000 persons who fled Thenmaratchy, we may say that several 
  tens of thousands left their areas after the LTTE had come into control of them.<u1:p></u1:p><a href="#_Toc515622132">[Top]</a></span></p>
<h1><a name="_Toc515622140"><span lang=EN-GB>The Destruction of Chavakacheri Town<u1:p></u1:p></span></a><span lang=EN-GB></span></h1>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>Chavakacheri town was the second largest 
  town in the Jaffna peninsula. It had a major base hospital, government offices, 
  schools, including Dreiburg College, one of the oldest schools in Jaffna, several 
  places of worship and its sprawling bazaar. Following the forced exodus from 
  Valikamam in October 1995, it was for some months the administrative centre 
  of Jaffna. We now learn that a good part of the town has been badly damaged 
  and is now no man&#146;s land.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>The LTTE first shelled the town and 
  the Army and civilians pulled back. A civilian who approached the town through 
  Dutch Road was turned back by the Army, indicating that the two sides were facing 
  each other in the town area. The extent of the destruction can also be gauged 
  from two civilian experiences of the shelling in this area given in this bulletin.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>It may be recalled that on 10<sup>th</sup> 
  May the LTTE had asked the civilian population to pull out of Jaffna town and 
  later some shells fell in Passayoor and Gurunagar. However several doctors at 
  Jaffna Hospital decided to stay put and this time the ICRC stayed with them. 
  The ICRC was evidently prevented from declaring the Hospital a protected area 
  because of the presence of the Army&#146;s Brigade HQ just behind. Had the LTTE 
  not been turned back from Jaffna town, it may have once again suffered the same 
  fate as Chavakacheri. Having in advance decided to withdraw from the peninsula, 
  the LTTE fought the Indian Army in 1987 and the Sri Lankan Army in 1995, withdrawing 
  into Jaffna City, and vanishing after causing maximum damage to the city.<u1:p></u1:p><a href="#_Toc515622132">[Top]</a></span></p>
<h1><a name="_Toc515622141"><span lang=EN-GB>Civilian Experiences<u1:p></u1:p></span></a><span lang=EN-GB></span></h1>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>Many of those suddenly caught up in 
  these disturbances had to go through the additional agony of not knowing the 
  whereabouts of their near ones from whom they were separated. They had to get 
  hold of a few things and follow their neighbours. We begin with the experience 
  of a young father, Kumar, from Chavakacheri, who is now in the Vanni:<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><i><span
lang=EN-GB>&#147;It rained shells [about 21<sup>st</sup> May]. We had no opportunity 
  to collect any of our belongings. We fled taking along our goat and her two 
  new-born kids. Sivankovilady (the precincts of Sivan Temple) is as desolate 
  as a graveyard. Vaiththy had died. Chavakacheri, Kalvayal and Mattuvil have 
  been flattened. One cannot bear to look at Sivankovilady. The houses of many 
  people have been flattened. Many have also been killed. All their bodies have 
  been buried in their front gardens and along roadsides. An unbearable stretch 
  of death... Finally, [before leaving for the Vanni,] I untied our mother goat 
  and her two kids at Kaithady, in the hope that they would fend for themselves.&#148;</span></i></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>Mrs. S was among a group of 20 people 
  who had taken refuge in a house at Sarasalai. An army patrol came there and 
  took all of them to a camp and screened them. All were released except two young 
  boys, one of whom was a psychiatric patient. Their fate remains unknown. The 
  others were escorted to a safe area.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>The wife of a school principal in 
  that group, who did not want to go, gave the others the slip. The principal 
  went in search of her and was shot and injured by an army ambush party. He was 
  later sent to Pt. Pedro hospital in a critical condition.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>L was with her brother and son. They 
  came to Mattuvil from Kaithady and joined a group of refugees at the Kalvayal 
  (Sella) Pillaiyar Temple. On 8<sup>th</sup> June, her son was lying down on 
  the floor next to the temple priest&#146;s son, when a shell fired by the Army 
  fell there. She went to her son and found him covered with pieces of flesh and 
  blood. The flesh and blood came from the priest&#146;s son who was mangled. 
  9 including the priest were killed in the incident. They crossed into Neervely 
  on 10<sup>th</sup> June when shelling became heavy owing to an operation. The 
  people felt that they could not stay on and the LTTE too did not then interfere 
  with their going.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>Earlier many of those trying to leave 
  were harassed by the LTTE and in some cases people were assaulted. In one incident 
  a group of 50 persons was crossing into the army controlled zone. Three LTTE 
  cadre blocked them, held the bicycle of the leading person and asked angrily<i>, 
  &#147;Are you going to go and get beggar&#146;s food from the Army?&#148; </i>The 
  younger boys in the group argued back, <i>&#147;We had been in the Vanni and 
  returned, we know what it is like there. We will never go there again.&#148;</i> 
  Because they were a large group they pushed the LTTE cadre and moved on. Others 
  have said that until 10<sup>th</sup> June the LTTE had prevented them from leaving, 
  as they were angry over the very poor response to their call to move to the 
  Vanni.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Most of those left behind moved into the army-controlled 
  zone on the 10<sup>th</sup> June. In some cases the LTTE had asked people to 
  leave saying that they were going to mine the area and the approaches to it. 
  There was a huge crowd waiting to cross the final stretch to the army check-point 
  on the northern bank of the lagoon bed. They had to wait in the sun as the soldiers 
  summoned them in small groups of about 50. The checking was slow, then followed 
  by registration before they were sent to a camp or to friends as they wished.<u1:p></u1:p></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>Owing to the large crowd waiting to 
  cross on 10<sup>th</sup> June, some had to go back and come the next day. There 
  were also reports that some of those who went back were killed or injured by 
  shelling. A number of persons with elderly or disabled relatives did not attempt 
  to move at all and remained where they were.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>While the LTTE was moving in from 
  Kaithady, D loaded his motorbike with household items and was moving towards 
  Chavakacheri. His family was away in a safe area. An LTTE shell fell into the 
  area and a soldier sustained an injury on his forehead. His companions asked 
  for the motorcycle promising to bring it back after taking the injured man to 
  the nearest first aid post. D waited two hours with shells falling around him, 
  but his motorcycle did not come back. He later stopped some cyclists and managed 
  to get away with his things. He has since not been able to trace his vehicle.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>J lived in Chavakacheri with his wife 
  and child and despite shelling by the LTTE decided to stay on. On the morning 
  of 12<sup>th</sup> May someone pointed out to him that his back wall was missing. 
  He found that it had been demolished by a shell blast and that a young woman 
  in the house behind had been killed and her father injured. Badly shaken he 
  spoke to some soldiers nearby. They told him with a note of uncertainty that 
  they would stay on, but advised him to move about one &amp; a half miles northward 
  where it would be safe.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>J took his family and some necessities 
  and moved with a group of about three dozen people to a house in Periyamavady. 
  This is a short distance east of Chavakacheri and then south towards the lagoon. 
  on 22<sup>nd</sup> May, J&#146;s wife looked into the field through a window 
  and saw a soldier on the ground pointing a gun at the window. She quickly moved 
  away when about 4 bullets came crashing in. After a silence the soldiers shouted 
  at the inmates to come out. Two ladies who could speak Sinhalese went out and 
  identified themselves as civilians.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>The soldiers then came forward. The 
  officer scolded them that they should never have come to the area which is dangerous 
  and that whenever they see a suspicious movement they radio for artillery support. 
  He gave them ten minutes to pack their things and get ready to be escorted out. 
  J dug a hole and buried some of his valuables.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>The party left half an hour later 
  and went to Puttur Junction, Meesalai. Discovering that he had left behind some 
  of his child&#146;s necessities, J went back to Periyamavady the next day. On 
  the way he ran into a sentry. A soldier asked him what he wanted. Then he asked 
  J for a description of the place where the things were kept. The soldier then 
  asked him to come there the same time the next day and that he will have the 
  stuff. J went at the appointed time and the soldier fetched the goods from behind 
  a tree and told him that the house was now in no-man&#146;s land and it is risky 
  to go there. J thanked the soldier and left. On 25<sup>th</sup> May the party 
  left for Vadamaratchy. On the 27<sup>th</sup>, the day the LTTE declared a cease-fire, 
  J returned again and told an army captain that he would like to retrieve the 
  valuables he had buried.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>The captain obligingly radioed some 
  of his men to help J and warned J to keep right behind the men. J carefully 
  followed three soldiers, and dug his things out. He learnt that the place was 
  booby-trapped. Those who got to their houses found doors and even gates missing. 
  Inside everything was poured out, with the chinaware smashed.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>There are still a number of people 
  left in Thenmaratchy. For example, 3 old people are living in Navapuram, Kaithady. 
  About 60 refugees are living close to Navatkuli High School. The Hindu priest 
  at the temple along Kandy Road in Kaithady, is still reported to be there. The 
  LTTE is already said to have carried away from Pooneryn several tens of lorry 
  loads of goods which belong to the people, and has not yet finished. Unlike 
  the people who returned to Valikamam in 1996, those who return to Thenmaratchy 
  would hardly have any houses to live in.<u1:p></u1:p><a href="#_Toc515622132">[Top]</a></span></p>
<h1><a name="_Toc515622142"><span lang=EN-GB>The Army<u1:p></u1:p></span></a><span lang=EN-GB></span></h1>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>Except for what has been mentioned 
  earlier, particularly the shelling, and despite the tense situation, major complaints 
  about the Army&#146;s conduct towards the civilians were few. One pertained 
  to 10<sup>th</sup> July when the Army sustained 19 killed in an operation in 
  Ariyalai. Some misbehaviour and rudeness towards civilians on Palaly road in 
  the Tinnevely area was reported. In Ariyalai too civilians who had fled the 
  area in May and had just returned faced assault by the Army. <u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>One reason for what happened was that 
  the Army had suffered more than a hundred injured apart from those killed. They 
  had, according to local sources, crossed Chemmany bridge and gone into Navatkuli. 
  A large number of ambulances were carrying casualties, and owing to a shortage 
  of ambulances, injured soldiers were seen being driven in pick-ups with fellow 
  soldiers holding up bottles of saline. At Tinnevely junction there was traffic 
  blocking the ambulances. Some soldiers began beating up civilians.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>Some civilians crossing into Neervely 
  complained that they were being detained after checking until the next batch 
  was called, for the protection of the soldiers. Others have also said that they 
  were well received, and were happy about the Army serving them refreshments 
  after registration at a local school.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>A particular factor that has helped 
  army-civilian relations is a general perception by the former that they and 
  the Jaffna civilians are on the same side - or at least neither want&#146;s 
  the LTTE to win. This came to the surface during the darker days following the 
  10<sup>th</sup> May when the LTTE tried to move into Jaffna City. Demoralisation 
  among troops returning from the front was evident, and mutiny seemed a real 
  possibility.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Soldiers from the front stopped in a house in Chundikuli 
  and asked for water. After refreshing themselves they said, <i>&#147;We are 
  going back and cannot fight anymore. You come to some deal with the Tigers and 
  live with them.&#148;</i> On Stanley Road, soldiers went house by house in the 
  neighbourhood and said that they were going home. Here was a clear message, 
  <i>&#147;We are tired. The Tigers are now your problem.&#148;</i></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>These were trying times when the people 
  already traumatized by earlier experiences of displacement were not sure about 
  their fate. The Government was in a panic and was trying several foreign sources 
  for help. Finally a change of command which placed Generals Janaka Perera and 
  Sarath Fonseka in charge, together with the induction of new weaponry, slowly 
  restored morale and the security forces began to fight back.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>However, on the military front there 
  has been a stalemate, in spite of the LTTE having relatively few cadre and auxiliaries 
  on the ground. This owes to the fact that the Army moves out in numbers and 
  theoretically it takes just one LTTE observer with a walkie-talkie who can spot 
  places and direct shellfire accurately to harass them effectively.<u1:p></u1:p><a href="#_Toc515622132">[Top]</a></span></p>
<h1><a name="_Toc515622143"><span lang=EN-GB>The LTTE<u1:p></u1:p></span></a><span lang=EN-GB></span></h1>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>The LTTE had, despite all the blunders 
  of the Army, miscalculated their ability to take Jaffna relying on fire power 
  and were caught up in a stalemate they had not bargained for. It was facing 
  the problems of a conventional army that had over-extended its cadre who were 
  also human. Fighters committed to the field for a given duration have to be 
  relieved. Once the Army started fighting back, the cadre too were made to fight 
  without a break suffering hundreds of their mates killed. Civilians in the area 
  also received reports of the LTTE&#146;s border force personnel, whose duty 
  was extended, deserting to return home.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>Although people outside the battle 
  zone tended to overestimate the LTTE&#146;s capacity to take Jaffna, those who 
  were among them saw cadre who were tired and fatigued. After listening to propaganda 
  speeches, the LTTE cadre had come there expecting the people to be grateful 
  for being liberated. It came as a shock to them to find that the people were 
  trying all available ruses to get away from them, and this then turned to anger. 
  Their subsequent offensive operations too were costly. About 40 women cadre 
  were killed in Nagar Kovil in early July. As reported in the last bulletin, 
  the LTTE is preparing for another concerted attack in Jaffna. Considering that 
  the new recruits have been subjected to a greater degree of coercion, the risks 
  are also heavy.<u1:p></u1:p><a href="#_Toc515622132">[Top]</a></span></p>
<h1><a name="_Toc515622144"><span lang=EN-GB>Civilian Reactions<u1:p></u1:p></span></a><span lang=EN-GB></span></h1>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>A notable feature of the presidential election in the 
  Chavakacheri electorate was an unprecedented victory by the UNP candidate, with 
  the PA a poor second. There is also a very mundane reason for it. LTTE infiltration 
  in Thenmaratchy was considerable and the people were afraid to discuss the 
  LTTE. A particular reflection of this is the 11 murders of civilians by the 
  LTTE from June 1997 to March 1998, in the Thenmaratchy Division (our Special 
  Report No. 10). This incidence of executions by the LTTE was significantly 
  higher than in other divisions. When the LTTE put it about in the area that 
  it wanted them to vote for the UNP candidate Wickremasinghe, many of them did 
  so passively. Local observers have attributed the high UNP vote to areas where 
  LTTE infiltration was high.<u1:p></u1:p></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>But today after being displaced to 
  Valikamam and Vadamaratchy, they are much more free in talking about the LTTE 
  and their opinions are frequently scathing. What many people experienced as 
  they left Thenmaratchy were taunts from LTTE cadre<i>, &#147;So you are running 
  away? We will come there as well!&#148;</i></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>Things had come to a pass where there 

  was no love lost between the people and the LTTE and both knew it. For people 
  in Jaffna in general, keeping away from the LTTE had become the main priority, 
  while the compulsions of the LTTE were to impose themselves on the people.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>Although the LTTE did use leaders 
  from Jaffna in trying to recapture their areas, the rank and file are conscious 
  that it is cadre from other areas, particularly the East, who have died by the 
  hundreds in an attempt to recapture Jaffna. This has resulted in simmering tensions 
  that can be eased only by creating conditions for enforced recruitment from 
  Jaffna. Paapaa, the commander of the LTTE&#146;s Border Force had told people 
  during late May that the LTTE&#146;s original plan had been to train 2000 civilians 
  and leave them in charge of defending Thenmaratchy. Observing the civilians 
  fleeing towards the army lines, he said bitterly, &#147;We have been deceived.&#148;</span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>Many people in Thenmaratchy, who visited 
  their homes after taking refuge in churches and temples, found them looted. 
  When they complained to the LTTE, they blamed it on their Border Force. But 
  in reality, the LTTE had been loading movables and livestock into tractors and 
  sending them to the Vanni. There was also a parallel operation in the army-controlled 
  or marginal areas. Here thieves with the connivance of elements in the Army 
  had stolen livestock and items like colour television sets, which were then 
  sold for much lower prices.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The looting in the LTTE-controlled area, which was 
  the policy of an institution, angered people even more. A sarcastic remark now 
  heard among the refugees is that the LTTE got their &#145;<i>Thani Nadu&#146; 
  </i>in Thenmaratchy. The expression could mean a separate state as well as bare 
  land. It is also notable that in several instances LTTE cadre advised civilians 
  who had helped them not to go to the Vanni.<u1:p></u1:p></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>Another incident of interest concerned 
  the Saivite Children&#146;s Home in Kaithady, where a number of orphans and 
  children without means were looked after. The LTTE were keen on transporting 
  the whole lot of them to the Vanni and Paapaa, the commander of the Border Force, 
  went there. K.V. Tharmarajadurai who was in charge, knew what it would mean 
  and firmly resisted it. It is also learnt that the LTTE complained about this 
  to their leaders. Tharmarajadurai led the children away to Valikamam and they 
  are now housed in Mallakam.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>When the refugees reached Vadamaratchy 
  and Valikamam, several community organisations came forward to offer them food 
  and refreshment, but the government machinery is said to have been slow in providing 
  relief in adequate quantities. The education authorities are said to have been 
  quite good in making arrangements for the schooling of those displaced. The 
  NGOs too have helped. The Nuffield School for the Deaf and Blind at Kaithady 
  has been moved to Vaddukkottai. Despite some early anxiety, the children made 
  it to the army-controlled area before 17<sup>th</sup> May.<u1:p></u1:p><a href="#_Toc515622132">[Top]</a></span></p>
<h1><a name="_Toc515622145"><span lang=EN-GB>Civilian Casualties<u1:p></u1:p></span></a><span lang=EN-GB></span></h1>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>Initial reports of civilian casualties 
  placed the number dead at 500 or much higher. But now that the dust has settled, 
  we can have a better idea. The appendix gives a list accounting for of about 
  100 of those killed. Most of the names that came to us were collected by a few 
  political activists who know the people and the places intimately. We also note 
  that judging by two testimonies in this bulletin, our knowledge about the civilian 
  casualties in the environs of Chavakacheri is quite incomplete. An allowance 
  must also be made for the injured who died in the Vanni. It will thus not be 
  amiss to take a working figure of 150 to 200 for the civilian dead in the peninsula. 

  Many more have been permanently impaired by injuries.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>Shelling by the Army was heaviest 
  from the 18<sup>th</sup> to about 23<sup>rd</sup> May, but as seen from the 
  appendix, regular shelling into civilian areas continued. A significant number 
  also died as the result of shelling by the LTTE. (See Appendix.)<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>Among designated places of refuge 
  shelled by the Army resulting in civilian deaths are :- Kaithady Kayitaviddy 
  Kandasamy Kovil (18<sup>th</sup> May), Chavakacheri Amman Kovil, Chavakacheri 
  Sivan Kovil, Mattuvil Sivan Kovil and Kalvayal Sella Pillayar Kovil (8<sup>th</sup> 
  June). The Kaithady Old People&#146;s Home had been shelled by both the LTTE 
  and the Army.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>A large number of the dead civilians 
  would have survived if they had received proper guidance from the Government 
  and the Army. The Army was facing uncertainties within and the controlled media 
  reports were intended mainly to pacify the South, and no one was then talking 
  about civilians in the battle zone. The civilians were told by the Army that 

  they would not quit Chavakacheri. Then under curfew the Army withdrew and started 
  shelling the area. Civilians trying to escape the shelling had also to contend 
  with the curfew and on the balance many decided to stay put.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>A group of civilians moved north from 
  Chavakacheri towards Kanagampuliyady. They approached Ladies&#146; College with 
  trepidation because they knew that the Army had camped there, and there was 
  curfew on. To their surprise they found that the Army had pulled out.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>Equally, the LTTE showed no concern 
  for the civilians, and the LTTE media which played to an expatriate audience, 
  concentrated on a triumphalistic coverage of the military events. The LTTE journal 
  <i>&#145;Erimalai&#146;</i> (Volcano) published in Paris, listed its military 
  successes and stopped significantly on 20<sup>th</sup> May. Hardly a word was 
  said about what the civilians had been through. Apart from the 15 who were said 
  to have been killed at the Old People&#146;s Home, the Tamil Net mentioned only 
  about 9 other civilian dead from Thenmaratchy during May.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>The nature of the politics of the 
  LTTE is that it would highlight civilian casualties by the hundreds when there 
  is a fairly clear case for putting the blame on the State and gaining some advantage. 
  Thus in May 1987 when an Army advance into Jaffna was imminent, the LTTE propaganda 
  spoke of hundreds of civilians killed in carpet bombing by the SLAF.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>But if the LTTE were to give the true 

  picture of the calamity that overtook the civilians in Thenmaratchy, it would 
  raise questions about the LTTE&#146;s approach to the whole problem, and why 
  its insistence on taking Jaffna, imposing conditions of total war on the people, 
  when the whole world wants it to negotiate. Moreover, the people were living 
  peacefully enough and were trying to keep life going and improve it. They were 
  not looking to being liberated by the LTTE in this manner.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>With total ruin heaped on them, and 
  with the destruction of records and everything of cultural, historical and educational 
  value, the folk of Thenmaratchy have been rendered a people without a past and 
  without a future.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>Thus the LTTE&#146;s coverage was 
  carefully crafted to stir the nationalistic vanity of the Tamil expatriate community 
  by keeping attention away from the extent of civilian suffering and destruction, 
  and by feeding their desire for vicarious triumph. When the content of reporting 
  is scanty, even those who have a concern for the people tend to reassure themselves 
  that things are not so bad, so as to keep their own sanity. This has, to some 
  extent, happened in the rest of Jaffna.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>An important reason for the calamity 
  is the disarray evident in the Army, and its lack of will even to anticipate 
  obvious dangers and take timely action. This problem is partly to do with the 
  inability of the Southern polity to put in place a viable political strategy.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>It is a frightening thought that the 
  increasingly sophisticated weaponry that is being acquired by the two sides 
  who have shown scant concern for civilians, may once again be unleashed on them 
  without notice in a more terrible orgy of destruction.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>It is also notable that no international 
  agency or the media got into the area when it mattered. Both combatants had 
  succeeded in keeping it that way. Understandably the ICRC requires the consent 

  of both sides to go into the area and it did so briefly only on 22<sup>nd</sup> 
  July to transport some of the elders. That again signifies the lack of interest 
  in the civilians by both combatants. One wonders at how the record of such an 
  extended ordeal for the civilians can become so shrouded in this era of mass 
  communication.<u1:p></u1:p><a href="#_Toc515622132">[Top]</a></span></p>
<h1><a name="_Toc515622146"><span lang=EN-GB>The Fate of Persons Taken to the 
  Vanni<u1:p></u1:p></span></a><span lang=EN-GB></span></h1>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>With the screws being progressively 
  tightened in the Vanni, the fate of people who had been taken there is one of 
  unmitigated misery. Several of them have said that they are barely managing 
  with rice porridge and are badly in need of cash. They find it impossible to 
  manage unless they join the Border Force or the Auxiliary Force by going for 
  military training, which will enable them to obtain provisions at a controlled 
  price. It not they have to pay black market prices.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>From the 67 families who were forcibly 
  taken from Iyakachci to the Vanni last December, 7 persons were detained for 
  allegedly being close to the Army. According to our sources, one was later released.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>The screws are also being tightened 
  on evangelical and pentecostal church groups in the Vanni who feel called by 
  their faith to remain pacifists. They and their ministers are being refused 
  visas by the LTTE to leave Vanni. We learn that only clergy from three mainline 
  churches are being issued visas. We reliably understand that the current action 
  against certain churches was put into effect after an assembly of evangelical 
  and pentecostal ministers in the Mullaitivu District addressed a letter to the 
  LTTE hierarchy, expressing their inability to co-operate in military training 
  that is now compulsory.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>Nothing could better illustrate the 
  plight of Thenmaratchy refugees in the Vanni than their own words. We give testimonies 
  from two persons who have featured earlier:<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><i><span
lang=EN-GB>Dharshi: &#147;I have been unable to find a church. The nearest is 
  10 to 15 miles away. I have no bicycle and even my slippers I left behind when 
  I fled... Food is the main problem here. Parthiban and Thanga sit in the front 
  compound and feed the children Suvanya and Lavanya. I feel unbearably dejected. 
  There is no employment. When we will get to go home I cannot say. I feel gloomy 
  when I look at myself in the mirror. I have become so thin. Prices of goods 
  are so high here that we could hardly buy anything. We constantly eat &#145;kanji&#146; 
  (rice porridge), and sometimes we do not get even that. I still don&#146;t know 
  where &#145;thamby&#146; (younger brother) is.&#148;</span></i></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><i><span
lang=EN-GB>Kumar: &#147;To whom can I pour out my sorrows? We wander as orphans 
  in the Vanni. We have no one here. Moreover my little girl fell from a school 

  bench and broke her hand. We took her to Akkarayan Hospital where it was set 
  in plaster-of-paris. My mother had an enormous flow of blood from her stomach. 
  We hospitalised her and she came back only today. We had no means of taking 
  her to hospital and finally I had to appeal to the &#145;Iyakkam&#146; (Movement 
  - the LTTE). She is now well. Having no job I am a quandary. There is no possibility 
  of employment here. If I think of everything my heart will break. We eat on 
  most days &#145;kanji&#146; in the mornings and rice and sambol for lunch. Things 
  are so expensive. All that I saved and purchased through living abstemiously 
  are gone. I simply cannot bear the sight of my children suffering. How are we 
  to live? Even a panadol tablet costs Rs. 6/=. May God have mercy.&#148;</span></i></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>Given this reality, the LTTE&#146;s 
  original plan to shift 50,000 to 100,000 people from Thenmaratchy into the Vanni 
  appears in its true light. The people who have gone to the Vanni are today virtual 
  prisoners.<a href="#_Toc515622132">[Top]</a><u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<h1><a name="_Toc515622147"><span lang=EN-GB>Early September<u1:p></u1:p></span></a><span lang=EN-GB></span></h1>
<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB>With the onset of the campaign for the general 
  elections, the Army launched a multi-pronged operation into the LTTE controlled 
  territory, and reports indicate that it had pushed the LTTE a short distance 
  further east of Jaffna City. Fighting was heavy with both sides reportedly losing 
  more than 100 dead on 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> September.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>It was also a revelation to the civilians 
  of what their plight would be if the LTTE advances into Valikamam that is densely 
  populated. The sound of the fighting could be heard clearly in the Mannar Island 
  70 miles south. Residents in the suburb of Chundikuli were also able to observe 
  low-flying helicopters overhead, firing missiles at targets 3 or 4 miles to 
  the east. Several shells believed to have been fired by the LTTE, fell in the 
  area of Roman Catholic cathedral in Gurunagar. An old man sustained injuries 
  in Old Park Road and a young woman was killed in Kopay. Many civilians have 
  shifted to safer areas and all in Jaffna are keeping their fingers crossed.<u1:p></u1:p><a href="#_Toc515622132">[Top]</a></span></p>
<h1><a name="_Toc515622148"><span lang=EN-GB>Claims &amp; Dilemmas: 25 years After 
  Duraiappah<u1:p></u1:p></span></a><span
lang=EN-GB></span></h1>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>27<sup>th</sup> July 2000 was the 
  25<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the murder of Jaffna&#146;s mayor and former 
  MP, Alferd Duraiappah. He may not have represented any great principle or ideal 
  in politics. But he had one great virtue, he was a killer neither in private 
  life nor in politics. He did not aspire to lead the Tamil people, nor did he 

  care to project himself outside the Jaffna electorate. Inside the electorate 
  his politics was simple. He tried to make everyone feel that he was their family 
  member. He even tried to befriend those who regarded him an enemy and attended 
  their functions uninvited. He knew everyone by name, and he could often be seen 
  in a Muslim tailor&#146;s shop near the Jaffna Court where he practised, half-seated 
  on a table, chatting to ordinary people, waving at passersby and inquiring after 
  their affairs. It suited him to have government patronage to pass on and so 
  he aligned himself with the SLFP.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>He posed a challenge to the nationalist 
  TULF (Federal Party) in the prestigious Jaffna electorate and nowhere else. 
  It irked the nationalists that this man who was oblivious to nationalist claims 
  and dealt only with jobs, transfers, market buildings, a stadium, public lavatories 
  and lamp posts could be popular with the people. Nationalist sentiment was often 
  secondary and did not always translate into votes. He catered to people who 
  wanted life to go on and the people had that choice by right.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>The nebulous and even vicious campaign 
  against Duraiappah as a traitor was articulated by the TULF and there is strong 
  circumstantial evidence of TULF instigation and acquiescence in the murder. 
  One of the assassins became the leader of the LTTE, and the murder marked its 
  stormy eruption. The incipient Tiger Movement were once known as the &#145;boys&#146; 
  of TULF leaders. Today the horse has all but changed places with the rider, 
  and where do the Tamil people stand after 25 years of this?<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>Many have been killed, and many children 
  are being offered no brighter future than to carry a gun. Then we have the tragedies 
  of widows, orphans, the maimed, those broken in mind and the social evils of 
  illicit liquor and prostitution. A particular irony is that throughout this 
  crisis people have been quitting this country and establishing themselves abroad 
  to pursue what Duraiappah offered in politics - to carry on the normal business 
  of life - and having made that choice, also then became extreme nationalists. 
  What they saw as impractical at home became abroad, an obsession. There were 
  indeed also many others who went into the liberation struggle with high ideals, 
  became disillusioned and confused and went abroad to live under conditions of 
  alienation. There is heavy pressure on them to drop their ideals and join the 
  mainstream so as to keep their sanity.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>The present tragedy of the people 
  of Thenmaratchy should be another eye opener. Many years of war did not do much 
  damage to the area. Most of the people were self-sufficient farmers having their 
  own plot of land, mango, coconut and jak trees, and rice fields. Today they 
  are refugees, a number of them are dead or maimed, and whenever they return 
  home there will be the nightmare of mine fields.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>Most of these people rejected Tamil 
  nationalist aspirations as represented by the LTTE, turned their backs on its 
  call to move to the Vanni, and took varying degrees of risk in moving to the 
  army controlled area. Rather than a pro-Army or anti-LTTE choice, it was a choice 
  for the normal business of life to go on. By the same token they would like 
  the Army to throw the LTTE out so that they could go back to their mango trees, 
  jak trees and plantain groves and live without undue interference.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>The LTTE&#146;s claims have been voiced 
  so loud and received so uncritically that the LTTE would be very slow in coming 
  to terms with the unenviable position in which it has placed itself and the 
  Tamil people. The ordinary LTTE cadre who angrily accused people fleeing towards 
  army lines of begging food from the enemy, did not understand that even in the 
  Vanni they would have lived on government food. The point is that if they are 
  left alone, the people need not beg form anyone.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>Even more serious are the consequences 
  of the event for the &#145;Thimpu Principles&#146; the LTTE ideologues insist 
  upon. The key demand therein for the recognition of the Tamils as a nation is 
  based upon their perceived oppression by the &#145;Sinhalese Nation&#146;. It 
  had a certain political validity in 1985. But to insist upon it today, the LTTE 
  should at least have been careful not to create a situation where a large section 
  of the Tamil people look to the &#145;Sinhalese&#146; Army to keep them away 
  from their would-be liberators. This absurdity is the ultimate consequence of 
  a chain of events resulting from the political murder of Alfred Duraiappah, 
  and Prabhakaran has lived to demonstrate that logic.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>The TULF has never accepted responsibility 
  for what it procreated, but several of its members, starting with Amirthalingam, 
  have been killed over the years while trying to make amends. It is overwhelmingly 
  clear today that what the Tamil people want is a political settlement for the 
  business of life to go on in conditions of dignity.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>Ideally the Tamils would like a federal 
  solution. But within the constraints of the situation there is a political process 
  going on, and the Tamil representatives have a duty to contribute to it positively. 
  There is greater virtue in contributing to create healthy traditions under which 
  power would be exercised, than to isolate themselves on a maximalist position. 
  The latter course would leave them appealing to the Tamil electorate on a chauvinistic 
  platform and it is the last thing the Tamil people need.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>The event also poses problems for 
  governments, peace groups, NGOs and academics who evaluate phenomena and help 
  to make policy. In the Chavakacheri electorate at the last presidential election, 
  the PA polled 3392 and the UNP 7490. This was widely interpreted as overwhelming 
  support for the LTTE, and such interpretations have uncritically featured in 
  evaluating the claims of the LTTE. When such claims are used to disrupt and 
  destroy the lives of local communities, they should be looked at much more critically.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>The fact remains that although 7490 
  persons around Chavakacheri cast a pro-LTTE vote, when it came to choosing between 
  the LTTE and the Army for their immediate survival, the people demonstrated 
  their will very clearly by voting with their feet. Only about 1000 went with 
  the LTTE and again it was often a choice forced on them by circumstances. This 
  aspect has received very little publicity. <u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>In the heat of the crisis where people 
  were trapped amidst shelling, no international agency could intervene successfully. 
  They were able to provide relief only after the people had extricated themselves. 
  In spite of the gravity of the situation, the demand for intervention from the 
  local publicity organisations was non-existent. Individuals, who wanted their 
  relatives brought out of danger rather than being forced to go to the Vanni, 
  could not get public attention. By contrast when 600 civilians around Pallai 
  in the south-east of the peninsula, came within the army-controlled area last 
  April, several organisations in Jaffna, including some university students, 
  accused the Army of using them as human shields and called for intervention 
  to get them out. The UNHCR representative visited the area and contradicted 
  the claim about civilian shields. This is the peculiar nature of the situation. 
  The rest of Jaffna too may face the plight of the people in Thenmaratchy in 
  the coming months. Facing future crises requires a worldwide response and it 
  means frankly facing up to the nature of the LTTE and the viability of its claims.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>The humanitarian law is inadequate 
  to evaluate what is going on and may even distract from the key issues. The 
  LTTE shelled civilian areas and then moved into these areas and fought the Army. 
  The Army in turn shelled these areas. Both parties have acted contrary to the 
  Geneva Conventions in not providing for the civilian population so as to protect 
  them from the fighting; and also in destroying Chavakacheri town (Articles 13 
  (Protection of the civilian population), 16 (Protection of cultural objects 
  and places of worship), and 17 (Prohibition of forced movement of civilians) 
  of Protocol II). But after so many years of war, this becomes almost a side 
  issue.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>In order to come to terms with what 
  is going on, one needs political criteria. The LTTE claims and enforces what 
  amounts to property rights over the Tamil people, their lives and what belongs 
  to them. Its right to kill dissent has not been seriously questioned. It believes 
  in its right to spurn negotiations, invade the habitations of the people, take 
  over their children, turn them into destitutes even as their fields converted 
  to minefields, and blast them back to the Middle Ages. This right claimed by 
  the LTTE is the key issue.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>The LTTE spokesman Anton Balasingham 
  says it from London that they would take Jaffna, as though Jaffna were their 
  property having nothing to do with its people. It is this aspect that makes 
  political negotiations an anathema to them. Rather than challenge these presumpti<span style='color:black'>ons 
  the tendency among peace groups has been to accommodate them. The people of 
  Jaffna have in April 1996 and today in Thenmaratchy, eloquently demonstrated 
  that these claims of the LTTE do not have their consent. This is not a force 
  making its bizarre claims from the interior jungles of Cambodia or form the 
  mountain fastness of Afganisthan, but is asserting them from every major Western 
  capital, from the very citadels of the Rule of Law. Not to check it would be 
  a grave affront to cilivilised norms. These claims too have their origin in 
  the usurpation of the right to Alfred Duraiappah&#146;s life 25 years ago.<u1:p></u1:p></span><span lang=EN-GB><a href="#_Toc515622132">[Top]</a></span></span></p>
