<h2>&nbsp; </h2>
<h2><a name="_Toc515538049">The killing of soldiers</a></h2>
<p>The afternoon began normally at St. Sebastian's junction on 11th October. About 
  2.00 p.m schools were about to close, and an old lady, as was her wont, had 
  taken her place at the junction to sell Jumbo (Naval) fruit to the children 
  on their way home. Two soldiers who regularly passed that way on bicycles, stopped 
  as a matter of habit, to buy Naval fruit from the lady and chat to her - a fatal 
  habit as it turned out. On this day two LTTE cadre sneaked up to the soldiers, 
  shot them unawares and vanished through the convent and then through the hospital 
  premises, jumping over fences, and through the open space with bushes that lie 
  between the Thalvupadu and Talaimannar roads. These two roads had check points. 
  But the space in between was uncovered. </p>
<p>As the schools closed, people became aware of the incident. While the bodies 
  lay on the road, the children rushed home and&nbsp; civilians vacated the area. 
  Others coming into the area and many expecting the army at any time, went into 
  nearby houses. The bodies were discovered later by policemen who passed that 
  way, and the army, camped near the market area 3/4 mile away, were informed.<a href="#_Toc515538048"> 
  [Top]</a> </p>
<h2><a name="_Toc515538050">The army arrives</a></h2>
<p>The army arrived at 2.30 p.m, by which time the area was largely deserted. 
  Surprisingly, given the sensitive nature of the situation, no officer of rank 
  was seen among the party. The senior-most officer was probably a junior(second) 
  lieutenant - no&nbsp; insignia of rank was seen on his uniform. Witnesses said 
  that some of the men were stone drunk. On seeing the bodies, the men went berserk 
  and opened fire at random. </p>
<p>One group went towards the hospital, entered houses, pulled men out and beat 
  them with gun butts and kicked them with boots. About five men were warded with 
  serious head injuries. Another group went to Panamkattikodu, a fishing village 
  that had suffered most during all the troubles. Again houses were entered into 
  and people were assaulted. A fisherman woke up to find a gun barrel pointed 
  at him. He grabbed the gun barrel and pushed the soldier away. More soldiers 
  came in and the man was beaten and kicked as he protected his head with his 
  hands. </p>
<p>Soldiers went about the area shouting filth in Sinhalese, breaking windows 
  and demanding that the inmates come out. Those who came out were assaulted, 
  abused and kicked. In the house of a bank official, Michael, several women were 
  cowering inside, and were afraid to come out when the soldiers called. The soldiers 
  fired into the house nearly missing the women. The women screamed that they 
  had been afraid to come out. The soldiers went away. Probably for similar reasons 
  a grenade was fired from a launcher into the house of the vice - principal of 
  the Convent Girls' School. Police commandos at the BMC sentry point also went 
  berserk, going into houses and assaulting people. <a href="#_Toc515538048"> 
  [Top]</a> <br>
  <br>
</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc515538051">The Killing of Cyril Ranjith (Cyril Master)</a></h3>
<p>Cyril Ranjith was a Sinhalese married in Mannar and long time resident there. 
  As soldiers moved down Convent Road they first entered the house of a bank employee. 
  Only his ten year old son and another boy who had taken shelter there were at 
  home. The soldiers were about to shoot the two when the junior officer came 
  along, grabbed the gun, turned it away and `requested' the men to move on. In 
  another house they found a nine year old boy with the mother. The boy was kicked 
  and assaulted and still carries a boot mark on his abdomen. </p>
<p>A few yards down one group of soldiers entered the house of Cyril Master. An 
  elderly shop keeper and an old lady had taken shelter in his house. He hid them 
  behind and stayed in the hall after assuring them that they would be safe. The 
  soldiers asked for his name and went away. Another group that was behind came 
  in, shot him in the face and went away. The bullet went through the neck and 
  shoulder, leaving Cyril Master dead in a pool of blood. <a href="#_Toc515538048"> 
  [Top]</a> </p>
<h3><a name="_Toc515538052">A ritual without purpose</a> </h3>
<p>There was no strategy or plan behind the actions of the soldiers. The junior 
  officer was not giving any orders, and no one was directing them. All the officer 
  did was to go behind the men and cajole them to move on, but not with any particular 
  end in view. </p>
<p>The Brigadier arrived from Thallady with a group of officers about 20 minutes 
  later. He walked down the road behind a group of men and apparently turned back 
  upon being told of Cyril Master's murder. He asked the officers to recall the 
  men, and was overheard telling another officer, &quot;The Tigers are somewhere 
  else and see where these fellows are looking!&quot; </p>
<p>People recalled that the Indian Army (IPKF) had a drill to surround an area 
  within a few minutes - day or night - if an incident took place. By comparison 
  tthe Sri Lankan army had no plan or&nbsp; strategy to tackle even a routine 
  military contingency.<a href="#_Toc515538048"> [Top]</a> &nbsp; </p>
<h2><a name="_Toc515538053">The public relations exercise</a></h2>
<p>The civilians were called out to St. Sebastians and kept for two hours for 
  an identity check. Since the Brigadier could not speak Tamil, the people were 
  addressed by Jamaldeen, HQI, Police. He told them that the Tigers had done something 
  extremely despicable as shooting men at a holy place. The people, he said were 
  innocent, though some concealed information about Tiger activities in the area. 
  He then apologised for `inconveniences'(sic) the people underwent as a result 
  of the incident. </p>
<p>That evening soldiers and policemen closely, but politely, questioned the old 
  man who had sheltered at Cyril Master's until the old man said that he did not 
  know who killed his friend. The coroner's report merely stated that the death 
  had been due to a bullet injury. The matter was effectively hushed up, with 
  all the incompetence and dastardliness. <a href="#_Toc515538048"> [Top]</a> 
  <br>
  <br>
</p>
<p><b><span style='font-size:18.0pt;
'>After effects<u1:p></u1:p></span></b></p>
<p>The event was about the worst shock the townsfolk received in the wake of promised 
  peace and normality. Relations between the forces and the people had been generally 
  good. It had become normal for many people to teach their children to speak 
  of Police Mama (Uncle) and Army Mama. After this experience children were once 
  shivering at the sight of uniformed personnel. Abuse shouted in the Sinhalese 
  language would have also left unpleasant impressions. The situation outwardly 
  returned to normal quickly. This is partly attributed to the feeling of discomfort 
  among soldiers that they had managed to shoot dead the only Sinhalese living 
  in Mannar. </p>
<p><b>Peace and the Politics of Disempowerments of the people <u1:p></u1:p></b></p>
<p>This may be one among several incidents of this kind happening in the government 
  controlled areas of the North - East. But what it portends should not be lost 
  sight of. The significance of the place and timing of the incident was not lost 
  on the people. It was a time when the area would have been teeming with school 
  children. Had the army arrived immediately instead of half an hour late, something 
  far worse could easily have happened. Given the record of the Tigers, one need 
  not entertain too many doubts about the intended purpose. </p>
<p>The only body in the area that could protest and call for effective remediale 
  action is the Roman Catholic Church. It moreover has a duty and right to do 
  so, and not less because of the venue. But merely condemning the behaviour of 
  the Army is not going to achieve much. But there is then a heavy price to be 
  paid for also being critical of the LTTE. In the end between the two forces 
  having scant respect for the people, the people are silenced and marginalised. 
  Given the nature of the situation, it is the LTTE that routinely capitalises 
  on their alienation. </p>
<p>After 17 years the army is literally at square one with nothing of the professionalism 
  needed to tackle a delicate political problem. The new junior defence minister 
  has ben addressing soldiers. But he too has shown no inclination to talk to 
  them politically and explain their role. He has mainly concentrated on re-assuring 
  them that the government would preserve the unitary character of Sri Lanka. 
  Nothing very helpful in that. </p>
<p>The government and the media are currently focussing very much on the so called 
  peace talks taking place at high level. As usual little attention is being paid 
  to what is happening at the level of ordinary people, and the efforts being 
  made by the LTTE to transform the hopes that people had placed on the new government. 
  Peace talks have in our situation been such a very volatile affair, that it 
  is irresponsible not to address what needs to be done to retain the confidence 
  of the people in the event of their failure. What recent events point to is 
  that there is no institutional machinery in place, no machinery for accountability 
  to the people, to prevent a repetition of the disasters of June 1990 if and 
  when the talks come unstuck. <a href="#_Toc515538048"> [Top]</a> </p>

<h3><a name="_Toc515538055">Issues:</a></h3>
<p><b>1</b>. The attack by the LTTE going by past experience, and the location, 
  and timing were intended to cause maximum damage to the civilian population, 
  provide potent fodder for propaganda mills and thereby give the LTTE additional 
  legitimacy. Such attacks have become more cynical in the use of civilians and 
  the results not less predictable. Such attacks will go on whether there are 
  peace talks or no. After more than a dozen of years, is it the government&#146;s 
  aim to continue to respond to such attacks through the&nbsp; agency of its armed 
  forces exactly as the LTTE wishes? </p>
<p><b>2</b>. The new government did at first recognize the need to understand 
  the alienation of the Tamil minority and to address this as a matter of urgency. 
</p>
<p>But the distortion of priorities that has accompanied the peace talks with 
  the LTTE may lead to a very dangerous situation. The issues raised during the 
  discussions which were publicized by the LTTE and the government, each for its 
  own reasons, are all to do with Jaffna. Most of these are purely material in 
  nature- transportation, flow of goods, rebuilding the Public Library and so 
  on. None of these can be said to be qualitatively similar as with issues like 
  loss of life, disappearances, mental trauma and human rights in general. </p>
<p>It is also significant that realization of basic human rights which has become 
  a major issue in the South has not featured in any significant way in relation 
  to the North-East. Again the East and Rural North have been almost forgotten 
  in the excitement of negotiations. That is how the LTTE would want it. But for 
  the government, it is a dangerous trap. </p>
<p>When the euphoria is over and peace makers feel chastened, the armed forces 
  are once more likely to vent their anger on the ordinary people. The Army Commander 
  has said that should the peace process fail they would hit the LTTE hard. As 
  in the past, those hit the hardest would no doubt be the civilians. <a href="#_Toc515538048">

<h3><a name="_Toc515538056">Recommendations:</a></h3>
<p><b>1</b>. Immediate measures should be set in motion to make the armed forces 
  accountable. The HRTF has investigated and named military officers in connection 
  with the Eastern University disappearances of 175 persons in September 1990. 
  Judicial proceedings should be immediately instituted to make those guilty accountable. 
  A start must be made in providing judicial redress for the victims in all similar 
  incidents in the past. </p>
<p><b>2</b>. The incident in Mannar could be treated as a test case. A&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  proper inquiry should be made with a view to punishing those guilty and for 
  instituting procedures by means of which civilian interests can be safeguarded. 
  It should be recognized that the normal judicial machinery available in the 
  South is defective when it comes to the North-East. For instance a magistrate 
  in the North-East has in practice very little authority. He dare not ask for 
  members of the armed forces to be produced in court. </p>
<p><b>3</b>.The government should try to understand the alienation of the people 
  of the North-East. The reasons are often deep-seated. The LTTE is not interested 
  in addressing this, but only in using it. The historical role of the state in 
  violence and colonization are all part of it. The government could for instance 
  set up a committee that would go beyond formal channels of inquiry in trying 
  to understand the fears of the people who live in those areas. <a href="#_Toc515538048">
