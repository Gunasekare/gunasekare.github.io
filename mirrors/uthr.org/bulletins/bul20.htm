  MILITARISATION</span></a><span
lang=EN-GB></span></h2>
<p class=MsoBodyText><b><span lang=EN-GB>T</span></b>he Vanni has been the focus 
  of war news from Sri Lanka ever since the <b>LTTE</b> importuned a large number 
  of civilians in Jaffna into the Vanni at the end of 1995 and engineered a humanitarian 
  crisis. As the result of effective lobbying no doubt, the <b>UN Secretary General, 
  Mr.Boutros Ghali</b> expressed his concern about the situation there and the 
  Vanni was thrust into international attention. The Government therefore was 
  obliged to be seen as caring for the people there by providing food and medicine, 
  while the <b>LTTE</b> tried all means to mould the civilians&nbsp; and civilian 
  life to service their military needs. The Vanni became thus the last fortress 
  of the Liberation Tigers. The Government on the other hand while verbally espousing 
  concern for the civilians, has been subtly applying pressures to make life difficult 
  for them, forcing scores of thousands to leave the Vanni and move into refugee 
  camps. For example essentials for a farming community such as kerosene, rope, 
  fertiliser and basic medicines for a malarial region and even panadol were either 
  banned or always in short supply. The <b>LTTE</b> for its part always administered 
  supplies sent by the Government keeping its military needs in view and profited 
  from encouraging black-marketeering, artificially aggravating shortages.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>On school-children and the young there was always heavy pressure 
  to join the <b>LTTE</b>. The <b>LTTE</b>&#146;s military successes at Mullaitivu 
  and Killinochchi and even halting the northward military advance had nothing 
  in them for the civilians. Their children were turned into cheap cannon fodder 

  in a war that was only bringing progressive ruin on the Tamil people. In the 
  so-called cleared, liberated or Government controlled areas, an oppressive and 
  debilitating regime has been imposed on the Tamils on the pretext of security 
  considerations. The Government has evaded world-wide censure only by not having 
  these offending regulations on the statute book. They are imposed covertly, 
  illegally and administratively. By so doing they are made all the more worse 
  by being arbitrary, while&nbsp; making legal redress impractical for the ordinary 
  man.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>A graphic illustration of the fate of Vanni folk is the refugee 
  camps in Vavuniya. Confined to these camps the inmates are allowed out for a 
  few hours at a time after obtaining a pass. They cannot leave Vavuniya for another 
  part of the country as the means of obtaining clearance are way beyond them. 
  These once hardworking farmers are now idling in camps, living on meagre government 
  handouts, with no proper schooling for their children, under conditions utterly 
  ruinous to both community and individuals. This has now gone on for close upon&nbsp; 
  three years. The camps being under government control with a police guard, the 
  NGOs are not allowed to intervene directly. At Poonthottam camp with 8500 inmates 
  for instance, the thatch was in tatters. A refugee said that he did not bathe 
  for three days as he had been sitting in the rain. To the rest of the country 
  and to the Tamils abroad vocally supporting the <b>LTTE</b>, these people have 
  by now become &#145;out of sight, out of mind&#146;.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB>Where the State is concerned, subjecting 
  Tamils to such a regime has meant rampant corruption and a degradation of state 
  functions and state machinery. It is a worrying comment on the Sri Lankan State 
  that by its inability to address security concerns imaginatively and intelligently, 
  keeping democratic ideals in view, it has been moving in the direction of conjuring 
  up images of apartheid, an arbitrary form of it without legal sanction.</span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText2>When the Vanni saga began in November 1995 with the UN Secretary 
  General&#146;s expression of concern, it passed off as a false alarm after it 
  became widely known that the <b>LTTE</b> had forced the people out of Jaffna. 
  But today the alarm is a very real one and it should not be too late for the 
  people when the world reacts.&nbsp;<a href="#_Toc515621277">[Top]</a> </p>
<h3><a name="_Toc515621279"><span lang=EN-GB>Recent Developments</span></a></h3>
<p class=MsoBodyText2>The Army halted its northward advance along the A9 trunk 
  road and changed tactics after losing Killinochchi last September with heavy 
  casualties to an <b>LTTE</b> onslaught using cannon and suicidal waves of fighters. 
  The losses among the <b>LTTE</b> too were heavy at 700 or more killed, and were 
  comparable with the Army&#146;s losses of considerably more&nbsp;&nbsp; than 
  1000. Both sides were in crisis and the <b>LTTE</b> launched an ambitious and 
  somewhat heavy-handed recruitment drive. But its success was very limited. </p>
<p class=MsoBodyText2><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp; </span>Each of the two sides had 
  lost between 2000 and 4000 killed during engagements in the Vanni. In deploying 
  about 4 to 5 thousand cadre for the attack on Killinochchi, the <b>LTTE</b> 
  thinned down its defences at Mankulam, which it had defended for several months, 
  enabling the Army to capture it with ease. Such indications suggest that the 
  present strength of the <b>LTTE</b> is below 10,000.&nbsp; </p>
<p class=MsoBodyText2><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp; In the meantime from last December 
  the Army adopted tactics where it had surprise on its side and has by now taken 
  control of considerable territory on either side of the A9 between Vavuniya 
  and Mankulam. By taking over the famed Roman Catholic shrine of Madhu which 
  also functioned as a <b>UNHCR</b> supervised refugee camp and the surrounding 
  agricultural region, a large segment of the Vanni population has been brought 
  under Army control.</span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText2><span lang=EN-GB>It is now estimated that about 125,000 
  civilians in the Vanni have come under Army control and 150,000 to 200,000 live 
  under <b>LTTE</b> control. A number well above 50,000 have gone to India and 
  a smaller number to Jaffna, over the last 3 years.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText2><span lang=EN-GB>The recent operations have been conducted 
  with hardly any loss of life. In villages people woke up to find themselves 
  among the Army. Farming villages not under Army control too hope that the Army 
  would move in, in a like manner. The immediate reasons for them are economic 
  and the protection of children. Under Army control they hope to obtain Rs.1200 
  for a bushel of paddy instead of the Rs.500 the <b>LTTE</b> pays them. Apart 
  from drastic reductions in prices of food and fuel, the cost of hiring a tractor 
  to prepare an acre of land for sowing would drop from Rs.5000 to Rs.2500. Even 
  rope for tying cattle has presently to be purchased in the black market for 
  smuggled goods. Their present disposition is to do with tiredness from what 
  both sides have very unreasonably imposed on them and has nothing to do with 
  any love for the Government.</span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText2><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp; On the whole the civilians are relieved 
  that the recent military operations passed without causing them much hurt or 
  damage . But there is anxiety about future uncertainties. They were tired of 
  the regime to which the <b>LTTE</b> had subjected them. Food rations to displaced 
  families though inadequate, became regular after the Army take-over. Necessities 
  such as batteries, milk food and medicines are available at normal cost. But 
  for the refugees who were displaced from Killinochchi, Jaffna and other areas 
  where military operations are taking place, it is going to be rising frustration 
  with oppressive regimentation of a different kind. </span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText2><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp; These refugees are now without means, 
  living on dry rations. Earlier many of them formed the mainstay of farm labour 
  in the surrounding areas. For example Adampan was a flourishing agricultural 
  area which had its harvest in mid-April. But the refugees from Madhu who used 
  to work in those fields have this time been prevented from going there by the 
  Army because it is still under <b>LTTE</b> control. Apart from them those who 
  ran small shops, were involved in the fish trade, or used to fetch items for 
  sale from the Government controlled area, are now out of work.</span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText2><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp; Out of sheer desperation many children 
  and even teenage girls started queuing up with plates outside the Army camps 
  at mealtimes. This gave room for rumours placing individuals at risk. When the 
  Army took over Madhu in late March, the civilians had to register for dry rations. 
  The Army made an announcement calling upon &#145;Maaveerar&#146; (Great Heroes 
  &#150; <b>LTTE</b> men and women who died in action) families to register first. 

  Taken in an unguarded moment, several of them went forward and were casually 
  registered without anything being given away. Today the Army is said to be getting 
  much information from persons who once had ties with the <b>LTTE</b>.<a href="#_Toc515621277">[Top]</a></span></p>
<h3><a name="_Toc515621280"><span lang=EN-GB>Deprivation, Hysteria and Social 
  Disintegration</span></a></h3>
<p class=MsoBodyText>With large sections of the Vanni population coming under 
  Army control, the <b>LTTE</b> took measures to retain some of the weaker sections 
  under its control.&nbsp; Recruiting among them is easier and their presence 
  ensured relief supplies. Many of the fisherfolk from Jaffna who were displaced 
  to the Vanni during the 1995 Exodus had settled comfortably over the years at 
  Vidatthalthivu and Pappamoddai on the Mannar mainland coast. Early this year 
  the Army indicated its new strategy by a westward move from A9. Just before 
  the second move towards Madhu in late March, the <b>LTTE</b> asked the refugee 
  fisherfolk in Vidatthalthivu and Pappamoddai to remove themselves northwards 
  to Kalliady, Illuppaikkadavai, Vellankulam and further north.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>The <b>LTTE</b> is thus squeezing them into a smaller area 
  where conditions are difficult. Their earnings have dropped as they&nbsp; now 
  face increased risk and harassment from naval patrols operating out of Karainagar. 
  There is also a water problem in their congested new habitations in the villages 
  mentioned above. Along with an inadequate supply, water has to be purchased 
  at Rs.2/= for a pot. For a variety of reasons including a reduction of supply 
  by the Government, the <b>LTTE</b> taking a share and disruption of administrative 
  arrangements, the provision of dry rations to the displaced in several areas 
  is very irregular. The people have heard the Government claiming over the radio 
  that they are being given rations monthly. But in the Adampan/Parappankandal 
  area for example, rations have been given only once since the beginning of this 
  year.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>Vast numbers of people in the area north of Illuppaikkadavai/Kalliady 
  are suffering from repeated bouts of malaria. The proportion is more than 50% 
  according to some observers. This condition can be overcome with proper medical 
  care. For permanent relief from the commoner&nbsp; &#145;Vivax&#146; variety, 
  a commonly used treatment involves a supervised dosage of &#145;Chloroquin&#146; 

  and &#145;Premaquin&#146; taken over a cycle of 8 weeks. These drugs too are 
  in short supply. But these people, in addition to not having had proper nutrition 
  for 9 years and having undergone displacement for 4 years, are made to endure 
  malaria on top of their vastly reduced resistance. Almost everyone is physically 
  very weak, having a skeletal appearance.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB>Amidst this deprivation there are shocking 
  events, the like of which have not been heard of in this country for more than 
  150 years. These have followed the new displacement into the Illuppaikkadavai, 
  Vellankulam areas. The parents of a new born babe quarrelled over the father&#146;s 
  inability to find the money for purchasing milk food for the infant. Then they, 
  together, killed the baby. In another incident the parents became so desperate 
  without cash, that they poisoned themselves and the children to death.</span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB>There have been several cases, two of them 
  well-established, where even in a generally impoverished environment, persons 
  have been killed on lonely jungle tracks for their money. In one incident it 
  was made to appear that the murdered person had hanged himself.</span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB>In Jeyapuram, close to Mulankavil, a displaced 
  family originally from Jaffna arrived, desperately hungry and without money. 
  They sought relief by digging up some wild yam, which they did not know was 
  poisonous. Th entire family perished.</span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB>Medical and educational services are in 
  a state of breakdown. Even in a relatively better off area such as Adampan, 
  there was only one clinic served by an RMP (Registered Medical Practitioner) 
  who was trying to leave. Antibiotics are not available. There is no panadol 
  in hospital, but it is available in the black-market for Rs.5 a tablet. Due 
  to the absence of refrigeration facilities, infants have not been given their 
  routine vaccines that are given in the rest of the country. It has been suggested 
  that the <b>MOH</b> Mannar could arrange for monthly visits to the area with 
  the vaccines carried in boxes of ice. </span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>An incident which illustrates the attitudes of both the Army 
  and the <b>LTTE</b> took place at Uyilankulam on 17<sup>th</sup> April. An <b>ICRC</b> 
  convoy carrying food was crossing into the <b>LTTE</b> controlled area. Some 
  policemen at the final checkpoint may have moved forward a little into no-man&#146;s 
  land as the convoy passed. The <b>LTTE</b> opened fire and killed three of&nbsp; 
  them. Technicalities aside it was an ungracious gesture, considering that it 
  was government food coming to them. The Army closed the entry point for about 
  12 days&nbsp; preventing all movement, demanding a guarantee that the <b>LTTE</b> 
  will not do it again. It is understood that agreement was reached.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB>But recently the ground situation has changed 
  and the <b>LTTE</b> has removed its permanent establishments in the area. Consequently 
  it has become easier for civilians to cross over into the Army controlled area. 
  The <b>LTTE</b> sentries withdraw north and come to their check point near Uyilankulam 
  (i.e Kattankulam) only at 11.00 AM. Many civilians get to the Army point before 
  then.<a href="#_Toc515621277">[Top]</a></span></p>
<h3><a name="_Toc515621281"><span lang=EN-GB>The Drive for Militarisation : The 
  General Trend</span></a><span lang=EN-GB></span></h3>
<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB>Amidst this anarchy of crime, starvation, 
  sickness and hopelessness the <b>LTTE</b> intensified its recruitment drive. 
  There was full-day propaganda blaring through loudspeakers, street dramas and 
  interruption of schools, playing on despondency and hopelessness. The Vanni 
  become anything but the pride and glory of the Tamil people the <b>LTTE</b> 
  said it would be when it attempted to evacuate wholesale the citizenry of Jaffna 
  into the Vanni in November 1995. It used to be the boast of <b>LTTE</b> propaganda 
  that areas under its control were virtually free of crime and discontent. Now 
  in the Vanni the tragic, inhuman reality behind fascist rhetoric was being laid 
  bare and the <b>LTTE</b> could not care less.</span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB>The <b>LTTE</b> had some success in Vidaththalthivu 
  where in the prevailing confusion amidst evacuation and uncertainty, some joined 
  its ranks out of frustration and desperation. But recruitment was not so successful 
  in the Adampan/Parappankandal area because the people were not so despondent 
  and the <b>LTTE</b> had evacuated everything of theirs some weeks ahead in anticipation 
  of the Army moving in. </span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB>In a school having classes up to the O Level 
  (Year11) in Mulankavil, a teacher took his whole class of about 20 and joined 
  the <b>LTTE</b>. The children were quickly removed away from the area so as 
  to put off distraught parents.</span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB>During April the <b>LTTE</b> moved towards 
  militarisation of the civilian population. All shop keepers, teachers and students 
  were compelled to take compulsory training. The first few days involved physical 
  exercises. In the Mannar mainland area the training was staggered. After Mulankavil 
  and Puthukkudiyirppu, the training of shop keepers in the Adampan/Parappankandal 
  area began towards the end of April. Training in this area was disrupted by 
  the <b>LTTE</b> pulling out its structures.</span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText3>The purpose of those who received the first stage of their 
  training in the Mannar area appears to be that of posting them as sentries to 
  inform the <b>LTTE</b> of fresh military advances. This would help the <b>LTTE</b> 
  to direct its artillery. Rumours had been afloat that the compulsory training 
  will be implemented at all levels to include village headmen and&nbsp; <b>AGA</b>s. 
  These new orders were received with widespread resentment. For shop keepers 
  who absented themselves, it meant closure of their shops as punishment. The 
  <b>LTTE</b> told those who resisted verbally that they do not deserve to live 
  in Tamil Eelam and should move out of the Vanni.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText3>A fisheries society in Vidaththalthivu was told by the <b>LTTE</b> 
  that they must all come for training. One member objected on grounds of personal 
  conviction. The <b>LTTE</b> replied that he must then leave Tamil Eelam. The 
  member said that the <b>LTTE</b> must then give him a letter saying that he 
  was forced to leave, if not,&nbsp; when he returns, he may like the expelled 
  Muslims find it difficult to prove his claims. The situation then becoming unsettled 
  due to Army movements, the <b>LTTE</b> left them alone for the&nbsp; present.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB>These moves to forcibly induct civilians 
  made them apprehensive of coming under Army control. That the <b>LTTE</b> is 
  anxious is clear. In his May Day speech in Mallavi, <b>Karikalan</b>, a senior 
  leader, said that their Leader<b> Prabhakaran</b> would surely find a strategy 
  to push the Army all the way south to Vavuniya. In Koddadichcholai in the East, 
  a woman leader said that they are proud to observe May Day despite all the difficulties.</span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB>Signs of disillusionment within the <b>LTTE</b> 
  have also been evident for some time. When <b>LTTE</b> cadre in the Vanni visit 
  their homes during a break riding a motor cycle or driving a pick-up, it poses 
  an attraction for the children to join up. But the older intimate friends in 
  the village of the visiting cadre are often told, <i>&#147;Don&#146;t come into 
  this organisation. What you see from outside is not the reality inside. We too 
  are waiting for a chance to leave&#148;.</i></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB>Because of attempts to induct school children 
  into the <b>LTTE</b>&#146;s military machine, parents are reluctant to send 
  their children to school and school attendance had dropped to an estimated 20%.</span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB>Except for trying to move the refugees and 
  their equipment out, the <b>LTTE</b>&#146;s attentions in what was left to them 
  of the Mannar District were half hearted, as the Army had started reconnaissance 
  moves and were expected to bring the entire district under their control. Their 
  more systematic and far-reaching attentions were in North Vanni &#150; the Killinochchi 
  and Mullaitivu areas.<a href="#_Toc515621277">[Top]</a></span></p>
<h3><a name="_Toc515621282">North Vanni: Towards Total Militarisation</a>&nbsp; 
</h3>
<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB>Although the Army was pushed back about 
  3 miles north from Killinochchi town last September, it took control of the 
  Oddusuddan sector in December and is now within 14 miles of Mullaitivu town. 
  This also entailed enormous displacement northward. For many it meant loss of 
  livelihood and great difficulty in getting rations. Farmers who fled from their 
  homes and fields in the area around Oddusuddan got into very desperate straits. 
  One family for example sowed on rented land in Murippu and the crops were destroyed 
  by floods. Closer to the Army controlled area, there is occasional shelling 
  by the Army, such as in Tharmapuram, where several displaced schools are also 
  situated. Those travelling out of the eastern sector have to pass through Vattakachchi, 
  which is subject to shelling, to Murikandy and then to Uyilankulam near Mannar. 
  They are advised not to travel alone in case of shell injury. A traveller met 
  a seven year old girl pushing a bicycle and her father walking behind. He had 
  no strength from having starved the previous day. For these once prosperous 
  people, even a cup of plain tea has become a luxury. Although education is in 
  disarray, some schools have done unexpectedly well due to displaced teachers 
  from Jaffna, with one student in Mullaitivu scoring 4 As at the A Levels.</span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB>Amidst this anarchy and hardship which would 
  only increase with time, the <b>LTTE</b> has launched an ambitious programme 
  of militarisation. We describe below the first stage.<a href="#_Toc515621277">[Top]</a></span></p>
<h4><a name="_Toc515621283"><span lang=EN-GB>Schools</span></a><span
lang=EN-GB> </span></h4>
<p class=MsoBodyText><b><span lang=EN-GB>Anbu</span></b>, the <b>LTTE</b> leader 
  in charge of schools has ordered that all&nbsp; school children from year 9 
  (13 years) and above must as the first step undergo 3 weeks of physical training 
  for 1 hour a day during school hours. This training is conducted by <b>LTTE</b> 
  cadre or by young teachers who have been given a month&#146;s training by the 
  <b>LTTE</b>. <span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp; This will be followed by the second step 
  which comprises 2 weeks of weapons training. First they would be given three 
  types of guns &#150; M 16, AK 47 &amp; G 3 &#150; along with grenades, would 
  be taught how to dismantle and reassemble them, and how many bullets each gun 
  could fire and their killing range. Next they would be trained how to take up 
  positions, and move under cover from one position to another. &nbsp; The same 
  training procedure has to be followed by the teachers parallely, but after school 
  hours. The lady teachers have been ordered to stitch T-shirts and slacks for 
  purposes of training.</span><span
lang=EN-GB> </span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>Having heard rumours about compulsory training, most parents 
  kept their children away from school when schools reopened in&nbsp; April. But 
  children continued to be sent to tutories which are doing roaring business. 
  The <b>LTTE</b> then approached tutory staff and told them that should school 
  absenteeism continue at this rate, the tutories would be closed. The tutory 
  staff then told the students that they should not come there unless they are 
  attending school. This put the parents and their children in a quandary. But 
  the <b>LTTE</b>&#146;s next move made it impossible to avoid training by staying 
  away from school.<a href="#_Toc515621277">[Top]</a>&nbsp; <b><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp; 
  </span></b></p>
<h1><a name="_Toc515621284"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;
'>Compulsory Training for the People&#146;s Militia</span></a></h1>
<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB>Having begun with schools the <b>LTTE</b> 
  drew up a scheme for a universal people&#146;s militia. The <b>LTTE</b> summoned 
  a meeting of village headmen (<b>GS</b>s), a part of the government administration, 
  who were to be the linchpins of the People&#146;s Militia. Each <b>GS</b> normally 
  has about 150-300 families under him. The <b>GS</b>s were told that they would 
  be responsible for compliance with the regulations, were given forms for each 
  family, and were asked to return with the completed forms. Each head of the 
  family has to fill in details about members, their age, sources and amount of 
  income, cases of serious illness and so on. The people from 15 upwards were 
  to be placed in 3 categories: 1<sup>st</sup> &#150; 15 to 35 years, 2<sup>nd</sup> 
  &#150; 35 to 45 years &amp; 3<sup>rd</sup> &#150; 45 years and above.</span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB>The 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> categories 
  will be compulsorily trained in the village camps being organised. Those in 
  the 3<sup>rd</sup> must go for training unless they can establish that they 
  are seriously ill. Even if they are granted exemption, they must be present 
  in the grounds while the others are training. </span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB>The people will be allowed to collect their 
  relief rations sent by the Government only upon the <b>GS</b> certifying that 
  the person underwent training. Thus those 15 and above who stay away from school 
  will get caught to the Militia. There is again a discrepancy between those training 
  in schools and those meant to be trained in the Militia. The former would also 
  include 13-14 year olds. Local observers suggest that this group would be used 
  as reserves. Orders have already been issued and Militia training is expected 
  to commence during the course of May.<a href="#_Toc515621277">[Top]</a></span></p>

<h3><a name="_Toc515621285"><span lang=EN-GB>The Co-operatives</span></a><span lang=EN-GB></span></h3>
<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB>The co-ops are the bodies distributing government 
  rations. As an allied move, the <b>LTTE</b> called up meetings of co-op administrators 
  in different areas. They were told that the co-ops would from now function directly 
  under <b>LTTE</b> overview. Rations, they added, should be given only to those 
  coming with certification from the <b>GS</b>. At one meeting a co-op administrator 
  complained that because the <b>LTTE</b> divert part of the rations coming in 
  for their own use, the co-ops run out of food to give those coming later in 
  the line who are entitled. The <b>LTTE</b> spokesman responded that it is the 
  fault of the co-ops. He added, <i>&#147;If you tell us the number you serve, 
  we will leave that amount and take the rest&#148;.</i></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB>In the Mullaitivu area, co-op administrators 
  protested that if they carried out the orders given by the <b>LTTE</b>, they 
  would get into trouble with their superiors outside the Vanni. The <b>LTTE</b> 
  spokesman replied, &#147;<i>If you will not work as we want, you can handover 
  everything to us and go</i>&#148;.<a href="#_Toc515621277">[Top]</a></span></p>
<h3><a name="_Toc515621286"><span lang=EN-GB>The Leader</span></a><span lang=EN-GB> 
  </span></h3>
<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB>According to the new rules no one is allowed 
  to leave the <b>LTTE</b> even after the completion of the mandatory 7 years. 
  When this was introduced some months ago, those attaining the age of 35 were 
  permitted to get married, after which they would remain in the organisation 
  but perform non-combat duties. Those who had left the organisation but were 
  in the Vanni were ordered to report back and deserters too were rounded up. 
  The number so brought back is said to be about 2000. There is said to be no 
  shortage of weapons. A section of those reinducted have been addressed by the 
  Leader, <b>Mr.V.Prabhakaran</b>.</span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB>About the first week of May the Leader addressed 
  a secret conference of all area leaders of the <b>Propaganda Wing</b>. He was 
  hard on them for their low effectiveness. This he said had resulted in an appallingly 
  low level of recruitment. To shame them, he delivered an emotional eulogy on 
  the achievements of the <b>Military Wing</b>, with references to Killinochchi, 
  Mullaitivu, the SL Army&#146;s aborted northward advance on A9 and the achievements 
  of suicide cadre. He gave them a time frame in which to take steps to boost 
  recruitment.</span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB>The Leader further ordered them to conduct 
  daily pocket meetings in every village. The lack of variety in propaganda material 
  too came up for discussion. While the <b>LTTE</b> controlled Jaffna, in addition 
  to the <b>Eelanatham</b> daily, the <b>Viduthalaippuligal</b> (Liberation Tigers) 
  came out monthly. At present the <b>Eelanatham </b>continues to be published 
  daily, but the second is irregular. The Leader asked them to regularise <b>Viduthalaippuligal</b>, 
  and to put out additional leaflets.</span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB>Some of the measures mentioned above are 
  being implemented and for the others orders have been given. Delays and modifications 
  may be occasioned by constraints and public resentment. These are high handed 
  and even fascist measures to impose on a helpless, starving, sickly, frightened 
  and an almost hysterical population, brought to this point by their liberators 
  by methodically blocking all saner alternatives. <b>Whatever the personal merits 
  of the Leader, his charisma and endurance, his manner of struggle, as we have 
  always said, is a mockery of liberation, and renders the Tamils objects of contempt. 
  A heavier responsibility rests with those sections of the Tamil elite who flattered 
  his vanity, without whose services this tragedy could not have been prolonged 
  for so long.</b></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB>Take one example: The Leader has moved far 
  towards using the food sent by the Sri Lankan Government for the displaced as 
  wages for military service in warring against the same government, on the grounds 
  that it is a genocidal government. He knows that human rights concern from around 
  the world, and rightly so, would never allow the government, whatever its inclinations, 
  to completely stop the food supply and starve the people. It is moreover a concern 
  he never allowed his own people.</span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB>Most Tamils have doubts about his cause, 

  those directly affected are often angry such as the victims of the Jaffna Exodus, 
  and one day the survivors of the Vanni ordeal too will be angry. Yet the Tamils&#146; 
  historical experience of the Sri Lankan state and the regular humiliations they 
  face, constantly reinforce a gut feeling of sympathy for his cause. It is of 
  course most often the self-indulgent feeling of those at a safe distance from 
  his organisation.</span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText2>To understand this and move some way towards eradicating 
  such gut feeling, we also need to confront and come to terms with attitudes 
  and practices of the State and of the Southern elite, that contribute to it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#_Toc515621277">[Top]</a>

<h2><a name="_Toc515621287"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;
'>Civilians and the Security Regime</span></a></h2>
<p class=MsoBodyText2><span lang=EN-GB>Earlier we referred to Tamils coming out 
  of the Vanni who are confined to refugee camps in subhuman conditions. There 
  are now about 14,000 such refugees in Vavuniya. This measure has no legal sanction. 
  It is hard to make a list of such unlawful measures. Being unlawful, they are 
  often individual and arbitrary innovations increasingly going out of control. 
  To take a common sort of example, an old man had come out of the Vanni and was 
  in Vavuniya trying to get a pass to travel to Trincomalee and join his daughter. 
  Instead of going to a refugee camp where the procedure to come out is arduous, 
  he submitted his application and boarded himself at the Hindu Youth Council 
  for Rs.30 a day. 52 days later a Tamil police officer passing by saw him and 
  inquired. The old man who had practically exhausted his money was living on 
  bread and plain tea, asked the police officer to buy some for him.</span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB>After further inquiries, the officer checked 
  and found that the old man&#146;s application had not even been faxed to the 
  Trincomalee police to check on his daughter, and took steps to dispatch him 
  there. In such matters Tamil civilians have no rights and the Police are not 
  bound by any obligation to perform their self-imposed duty expeditiously. In 
  the meantime, after 52 days, the old man had begun to starve.</span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText2><span lang=EN-GB>In another instance a displaced elderly 
  man on a wheel chair with an ailment wanted to go from Vavuniya to Colombo to 
  consult a specialist. The Police wanted a letter from the <b>DMO</b>, Vavuniya, 
  stating that consultation for the ailment was unobtainable in Vavuniya. It was 
  in clear breach of a man&#146;s right to travel within his own country and to 
  consult a doctor of his choice. Moreover this case and that above relate to 
  persons who are clearly neither terrorists nor suicide bombers.</span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB>Getting permission to travel out of the 
  North has been made a tedious process. In Mannar town which serves a large area, 
  it means hanging about for several whole days at the pass office to see the 
  police officer, even paying a bribe through an agent, and much paper work. Those 
  who plan systems do not even know if they work, and make the public suffer instead. 
  For example, for a person coming from the <b>LTTE</b> area to travel abroad 
  or to Colombo, someone in the cleared (Army controlled) area has to stand guarantee. 
  Someone in Mannar town for example has to surrender the local Army identity 
  card and is given a temporary pass to remain in Mannar &#150; not valid for 
  travelling out of town. The person going abroad upon completing arrangements 
  in Colombo has to send the guarantor by fax, copies of the visa and ticket. 
  These are then produced to the Police who in turn ask the Colombo Airport by 
  fax if the traveller has left. A lady who stood guarantee for an old lady going 
  to India submitted the fax and went and hung around at the pass office to get 
  back her Army identity card (which again has no legal recognition). At length 
  she learnt that the Colombo Airport never responds to such queries from the 
  local police.</span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText2>The illegality of the whole range of practices, including 
  compulsory registration in Colombo &#150; in practice for Tamils only &#150; 
  and the need to carry the registration form around are underpinned by one singular 
  fact : When an Inspector General of Police and the Attorney General were asked 
  about registration and the need to carry the form in Colombo, they responded 
  that these were not necessary. But it goes on. There is a particularly interesting 
  absurdity. Sections of the security forces run rackets to smuggle persons from 
  the North into Colombo in their vehicles for about Rs.20,000 per head. There 
  have been cases of smuggled persons being apprehended by the Police in Colombo 
  and then let off, because there are no legal grounds for prosecution. The most 
  the Police can do is to detain the person on grounds of suspicion under the 
  <b>PTA</b> and have the detention order extended from time to time by tame magistrates, 
  knowing well that there is no case. The bulk of the Tamil detainees belong to 
  this category. Being made to work in this moronic regime has a strong corrupting 
  influence on security officials.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB>The system drives the policeman to ask not 
  what law this person is in breach of, but rather how much he can pay? These 
  practices have spawned a host of shady lawyers and agents, claiming to be able 
  to bribe police officials and even magistrates. It brings about the degradation 
  of the whole system of law, and of the State itself.</span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB>With the Government bereft of any political 
  strategy to integrate the Tamils into the national fabric, these security regulations 
  become more and more oppressive and arbitrary with every bomb that goes off 
  in Colombo. They may be bearable for a few months. But continued indefinitely 
  with no end in sight they become in effect a system of apartheid under the name 
  of security, but without a legal framework. <a href="#_Toc515621277">[Top]</a></span></p>
<h5><a name="_Toc515621288"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;
'>Countering An Impending Tragedy</span></a></h5>
<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB>A very perilous situation now confronts 
  us in the Vanni that could carry the tide of events in several unexpected directions. 
  Like every fascist movement the <b>LTTE</b> will run the course of destroying 
  itself. It is also characteristic of them that in their final inferno they try 
  to take large numbers of their own people down with them.</span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>Thanks to the Government&#146;s procrastination, the <b>UNP</b>&#146;s 
  opportunism and the volatility of the Southern political scene, a political 
  solution to the ethnic problem once more looks distant. This created despondency 
  in the ordinary Tamil mind, that if the <b>LTTE</b> is finished, they would 
  be cheated once again. In many unseen ways the failure to have a political solution 
  in place generates the dynamism to prolong the conflict. Had the Government&#146;s 
  &#145;Peace Package&#146; been a fact of life today, we would have faced a far 
  less daunting situation in the Vanni. There would have been hope for the people, 
  and hence more resistance to the <b>LTTE</b>&#146;s impositions. Indeed there 
  is resistance even today.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB>It is imperative that we face up to, in 
  advance, the limitations of the Sri Lankan Forces. When operations were started 
  in Jaffna during 1995, without any provocation from below the Air Force bombed 
  a refugee concentration in Navaly killing 120 civilians in July and again in 
  Nagar Kovil killing about 40 civilians in September. In the Vanni today, the 
  <b>LTTE</b>, unlike in Jaffna in 1995, is doing everything possible to blur 
  the distinction between combatants and non-combatants. A couple of aerial attacks 
  like the ones above in Jaffna, and total mobilisation is bound to be seen as 
  legitimate, with the people feeling that they were with their backs to the wall.</span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB>The experience in 1995 (as recorded in our 
  <b><a
href="..\SpecialReports\spreport6.htm">Special Report No 6</a></b>, <b>The Jaffna 
  Exodus</b>) could give us ideas for the protection of civilians. There is a 
  compelling case for enabling International NGOs to go into the <b>LTTE</b> controlled 
  areas and organise safety zones for the civilians. If the Government Forces 
  are enjoined to conduct themselves with restraint, it may well turn out that 
  large numbers of <b>LTTE</b> cadre, many of whom are fighting for the lack of 
  an alternative, would surrender when the opportunity arises.</span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>Most of the displaced persons in the Vanni would have come 
  out into the Government controlled area by now, if not for Government restrictions. 
  Those who come out have been confined to camps in sub human conditions, while 
  there is land in Vavuniya for them to live independently in temporary&nbsp; 
  abodes. This is part of the mindset of a state machinery that has lent complicity 
  to displacing Tamils and Muslims in Trincomalee urban limits, settling Sinhalese 
  in their place and regularising the new occupation [see for example <b>Special 
  Report No 8</b>]. The present plight of Tamil refugees also has much to do with 
  state ideology rather than with legitimate security concerns.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB>Urgency demands that the immediate concern 
  should be directed towards the civilians in the conflict zone. International 
  agencies should be enabled to go into the area with such quantities of food 
  and medicine as are deemed adequate. This will not save the <b>LTTE</b> which 
  is in the process of destroying itself. But it would do much to protect the 
  people and keep them away from the <b>LTTE</b>.</span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>The political solution too can no longer be delayed. From 
  the time of the <b>B-C pact</b> of 1957 it has been our experience that delay 
  and defensive pleading eroded credibility and caused governments to renege on 
  their commitments. The country itself has continued to remain an intellectual 
  and economic backwater, dominated by paranoid and increasingly security&nbsp; 
  conscious ruling interests, thus unable to realise its potential. Indeed a mental 
  framework dependent on interests which cannot countenance the truth, leads inevitably 
  to intellectual degradation. The 1980s and particularly the Southern insurgency, 
  amply revealed that the Tamil militancy was to a considerable extent a pretext 
  for the repressive laws and military machine these ruling interests called into 
  existence. The country needs a new vision, not a repackaging of discredited 
  notions. What the President has been saying in public, goes a considerable way 
  in that direction.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>A demand for federal status for, broadly speaking, the North-East, 
  with far-reaching provisions for autonomy, would be irresistible in the modern 
  world. There should be a concerted attempt by all concerned to bring this about. 
  This alone would help the Tamils to find their feet, and for the State to dismantle 
  this system of creeping apartheid that is increasingly enveloping the lives 
  of Tamils. Eventually there should be a demilitarised&nbsp; North-East, with 
  no more than a token presence of the national army.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB>As for the Tamil diaspora, it is these issues, 
  and especially the protection of civilians in imminent danger, towards which 
  they should direct their considerable lobbying powers. The Tigers and the destructive 
  power they wielded were indeed for the most part the creation of an ideologically 
  driven state that was pushing the Tamil people to live at the end of their nerves. 
  It was for them a regime of violence with impunity &#150; both mob violence 
  and state violence. Lands they had farmed for several decades, and their own 
  homes, often enough ceased to belong to them, having been snatched away overnight 
  by gazette notifications hatched in secret.</span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB>But propping up the Tigers in their present 
  form would only further the decimation of the Tamil community. And it can be 
  done only at the expense of children of families in the Vanni, who are groping 
  for survival amidst starvation, fear and disease. A struggle that ultimately 
  leaves Tamil children and teenage girls holding empty plates, queuing outside 
  Sri Lankan Army camps at mealtimes, is no liberation struggle.</span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB>The nature of the Tigers and where they 
  would carry the Tamil people have been well understood for many years. But thanks 
  to the opportunism of many, this has been obfuscated and the suffering of the 
  Tamil people prolonged. The following was written by <b>Dr.Rajani Thiranagama</b>, 
  the 10<sup>th</sup> anniversary of whose murder falls this year, in the context 
  of the Indian Army&#146;s advance into Jaffna in October 1987 :</span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><b><i>&#147;&#133;&#133;&#133;&#133;They continued to lure 
  the army, just to run away, letting the people face the result. It was cruelest 
  of all when they told the people that another 500 to 1000 must die for them 
  to have a viable international publicity campaign. This was not an isolated 
  instance or statement of a group without contact with the leadership. It was 
  pronounced at many places and in many forms. When the people were starving, 
  wandering around like dogs for rice, the Tigers issued leaflets asking the people 
  to boycott Indian distributed food.</i></b></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><b><i><span lang=EN-GB>When the children were dying with 
  diseases, they threatened those who cared for them, ordering them not to issue 
  Indian drugs. Did they offer alternatives, so that we could eat Tiger food and
