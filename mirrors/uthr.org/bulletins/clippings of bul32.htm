<p class=MsoBodyText>Associated Press, Thu May 8, 2003 01:57 EDT . - - COLOMBO, 
  Sri Lanka - (AP) International peace monitors said Thursday that revenge killings 
  of political opponents and former military spies mostly blamed on Tamil Tiger 
  rebels could pose a &#147;serious threat&#148; to the truce in Sri Lanka - &#145;s 
  civil war. The University Teachers of Human Rights of Jaffna a group founded 
  by teachers in the Tamil heartland to keep track of the human rights situation 
  in Sri Lanka - &#145;s northeast said last week that the rebels had killed at 
  least 15 ethnic Tamils, who were allegedly Sri Lankan military informants, since 
  the cease-fire was signed in February 2002. </p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>The rebels had been fighting for a separate state since 1983, 
  claiming discrimination of minority Tamils at the hands of the majority Sinhalese.

<p class=MsoBodyText>The rebels last month pulled out of peace talks, accusing

  <span class=header1><b><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:Arial'>S.Lanka 
  rebels said recruiting fewer children</span></b></span></p>
<p>By Lindsay Beck </p>
<p>COLOMBO, May 8 (Reuters) - The United Nations said Sri Lanka's Tamil Tiger 
  rebels were recruiting fewer child soldiers but international truce monitors 
  criticised the rebels on Thursday for alleged political killings. </p>
<p>The United Nations Children's Fund said the number of reported cases of child 
  recruitment had declined each month since the beginning of 2003, with just eight 
  cases in April, down from 92 in January. </p>
<p>&quot;We still haven't seen significant releases of children, but we're hoping 
  that will change once relief mechanisms are in place,&quot; said UNICEF official 
  Sarah Lendon. </p>
<p>Action to stop the recruitment of children is seen as a test of the rebels' 
  sincerity in peace talks. </p>
<p>There have been persistent complaints of the rebels' recruiting children as 
  young as 12 despite past pledges to stop the practice and a ceasefire holding 
  since February last year after 20 years of civil war. </p>
<p>The Norwegian-brokered peace process is seen as the best chance for ending 
  the war that has killed 64,000, after four previous bids failed, although the 
  Tigers suspended direct peace talks with the government last month. </p>
<p>UNICEF said despite the suspension, with the rebels say is over a lack of progress 
  in rebuilding Tamil areas, it is pushing ahead to start construction in late 
  May of transit centres to house released children while their families are traced. 
</p>
<p>But Nordic monitors overseeing the truce said a series of attacks on political 
  opponents was undermining the ceasefire and created a climate of fear in the 
  Tamil-majority north and east. </p>
<p>&quot;Such attacks, especially when they appear to be systematic, spread fear 
  among the population, create political oppression and are deliberately undermining 
  the peace process,&quot; the Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission said in a statement. 
</p>
<p>Monitors said the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, fighting since 1983 for 
  a separate state for minority Tamil people, denied involvement in the killings.<a href="#_Toc40327031">[Top]</a></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The Norwegians monitoring the ceasefire in Sri Lanka&nbsp; 
  have come under increasing fire from two minority Tamil organisations for ignoring 
  the killing of soldiers and Tamil political activists. </p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>The University Teachers for Human Rights (Jaffna), an academic 
  outfit that made a critical assessment of the 20-year civil war in the island 
  and the Eelam Peoples Democractic Party (EPDP), an anti-LTTE militant group, 
  have separately accused the Norwegian led Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission for remaining 
  silent over a string of LTTE murders in recent weeks.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>The UTHR said the Norwegians were maintaining a &#147;notable 
  silence&#148; on these killings and only referred complaints against the LTTE 
  to the police. </p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>The teachers&#146; human rights group also blamed the government 
  saying that the police lower rankers did not have proper instructions from the 
  top on how to handle these LTTE killings due to the ongoing peace process. </p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>In recent weeks, the LTTE has gunned down soldiers belonging 
  to a till-recently secretive deep-penetration unit that once hunted the LTTE 
  leadership in the jungles and also have been targetting rival EPDP cadres.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>The teachers say that both in the Tamil populated north and 
  east, as well as in greater Colombo areas, the LTTE has mobile pistol-squads 
  operating on mo-bikes who act as a rapid deployment force when scouts spot a 
  target. </p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>The EPDP has asked that their cadres be re-issued with weapons 
  that they had to surrender when the government-LTTE truce came into effect in 
  February last year. </p>

<p>May 08, Colombo: Officials of the Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission (SLMM) have

  country. </p>
<p>It also said that these criminal acts are direct attacks on the foundations 
  and development of democracy and have no place in a civilized society. Such 
  attacks spread fear among the population, create political oppression and are 
  definitely undermining the peace process. </p>

<h3><a name="_Toc40326415"></a><a name="_Toc40327033">Tiger killing spree rocks 
  Sri Lanka truce</a></h3>
<p>Agence France-Presse</p>
<p class=MsoList>Colombo, May 8</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>Sri Lanka has lodged a strong protest over a series of killings 
  of political leaders and former intelligence operatives by Tamil Tiger rebels 
  in violation of a truce, a senior minister said on Thursday. </p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>The protest was conveyed through Norwegian peace facilitators, 
  government spokesman and constitutional affairs minister GL Peiris said, adding 
  that the authorities will deal with the perpetrators under normal criminal law.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>&#147;The government has protested strongly about the assassinations,&#148; 
  Peiris said. &#147;Criminal law will be applied against those responsible for 
  the killings in and around Colombo and the east (of the island).&#148;</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>Official figures show that about 25 military informants, 
  operatives and Tamil political activists had been gunned down since the rebel 
  Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) entered into a Norwegian-brokered truce 
  on February 23 last year.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>The Scandinavian team monitoring the truce said the attacks 
  were a serious threat to the stability of the ceasefire which is the basis for 
  peace negotiations between the government and the Tigers.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>The talks have been suspended since April 21 when the Tigers 
  said they were pulling out in protest against what they see as slow delivery

<h3><a name="_Toc40326416"></a><a name="_Toc40327034">Fear of army withdrawal 
  leads to flight of capital from Jaffna</a></h3>
<p class=MsoList>Hindustan Times</p>
<p class=MsoList>P K Balachanddran</p>
<p class=MsoList>Colombo, May 2</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>Afraid that the Sri Lankan army will one day withdraw from 
  the Jaffna peninsula and the LTTE will take over, many Jaffna businessmen are 
  moving their capital to Colombo in South Sri Lanka, says the latest report of 
  the University Teachers for Human Rights-Jaffna (UTHR-J).</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>&#147;The people are by no means enthusiastic about moving 
  the army out. In the event of moving the army out, a number of traders are planning 
  to wind up their operations in Jaffna and several of them have moved substantial 
  capital to Colombo,&#148; the report says.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>The report accuses the Scandinavian ceasefire monitors, the 
  international (Western) backers of the peace process, and the Sri Lankan government, 
  of wantonly allowing the LTTE to threaten, kidnap, extort and kill at will, 
  only to keep it at the negotiating table.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>The report recalls that at the last round of peace talks 
  in Hakone, in Japan, in the third week of March, both the LTTE and the Sri Lankan 
  government shot down a proposal to entrust the monitoring of Human Rights to 
  a neutral international body. Instead, they entrusted the task to the Sri Lanka 
  Human Rights Commission, knowing fully well that the SLHRC did not have the 
  ability to do the job in the conflict ridden environment in the Tamil North 
  East. Also, it had not demonstrated independence in its work thus far, the report 
  added.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>A former head of Amnesty International, Ian Martin, was at 
  the talks venue in Hakone, specially invited to help set up a system to monitor 
  human rights violations. But he was ignored.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>The fear of Jaffna businessmen of an army withdrawal and 
  a take over by the LTTE is well-founded because the LTTE has been pressing the 
  government to move the army out from Jaffna town and other populated areas in 
  the peninsula. In fact, it withdrew from the peace talks on April 21, saying 
  that the army must first be moved out of the populated areas and must shrink 
  the High Security Zones (HSZ) in the Jaffna peninsula.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>Tamil Guardian, an acknowledged mouthpiece of the LTTE, has 
  stated in an editorial in the latest issue, that the LTTE is unlikely to return 
  to the negotiating table without significant concessions in this matter. This 
  puts the government in a fix. And sure enough, the appeasers in the government 
  have begun to exert pressure on Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>Meanwhile, the LTTE is getting tougher. Reacting to Wickremesinghe&#146;s 
  contention on April 30, that the army was moving out of Subhash and Gnanam Hotels 
  in Jaffna town, the LTTE&#146;s Political Wing leader S.P. Tamilchelvan has 
  pointed out that the place that the army will be moving into is still in the 
  middle of a very thickly populated area. The new location is next to the Telecom 
  Office, near the main Jaffna post office, the Multipurpose Cooperative Society, 
  Veerasinghanm Hall, the fish market and the stadium, all places where people 
  converge.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>The government&#146;s move was against the &#147;letter and 
  spirit&#148; of the Ceasefire Agreement which sought to minimise military presence 
  in populated areas, Tamilchelvan pointed out.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>But very significantly, and despite all the sound, fury and 
  posturing on the issue, the LTTE has not been able to organise a mass movement 
  in its support. Jaffna watchers say that the LTTE obviously lacks genuine public 
  support on this issue.&#148; The people may not like the army, but certainly 
  they don&#146;t want the LTTE back,&#148; says D.Siddharthan, the leader of 
  the Peoples&#146; Liberation Organisation of Tamil Eelam (PLOTE). He also said 
  that may Tamil expatriates were visiting Jaffna, not to buy or rebuild property, 
  but to sell them, while the guns were silent!</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>The UTHR-J reports gives a list of political opponents, civilians 
  and Sri Lankan armymen killed by the LTTE since the signing of the Ceasefire 
  Agreement in February 2002.Atleast 15 army informants have been killed, some 
  in the heart of Colombo. In Batticalao, the LTTE has been telling the people 
  that despite its assurance at Hakone that it will not recruit children for its 
  combat units, the old order to every Tamil family to give one child to the movement, 
  still stood.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>The UTHR-J points out that the Sri Lankan government, the 
  SLMM and the international donors have callously brushed this grave human rights 
  question under the carpet. Pleading for a long term view of the human rights 
  issue, the report recalls what happened in Sierra Leone. There too, the foreign 
  peace brokers had cynically installed a criminal rebel gang in power only for 
  the sake of a settlement. But eventually, Britain had to deploy troops to clear 
  the mess, created by this criminal outfit.<a href="#_Toc40327031">[Top]</a></p>
<h3><a name="_Toc40326417"></a><a name="_Toc40327035">Tamil human rights group 
  accuses rebels of killings of political opponents</a> </h3>
<p class=MsoBodyText>Associated Press, Fri May 2, 2003 05:52 EDT . - - COLOMBO, 
  Sri Lanka - (AP) A Tamil human rights group in Sri Lanka - accused the Tamil 
  Tiger rebels Friday of carrying out revenge killings and other abuses. </p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>The University Teachers of Human Rights of Jaffna said the 
  Liberation Tigers of Tamileelam had killed at least 15 Tamils, who were allegedly 
  Sri Lankan military informants, since a Norway-brokered cease-fire between the 
  rebels and government was signed in February 2002. </p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>&#147;The (rebels&#146;) intelligence activity and targeted 
  killings have intensified ... as the LTT endeavors to eradicate political opponents 
  and military enemies,&#148; the rights group said in an e-mail sent to news 
  organizations in Colombo. </p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>There was no immediate reaction from the rebels. </p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>The group said reports of surveillance, harassment, and abduction 
  by the rebels have also increased. Warning of more killings, it said the rebels 
  were taking advantage of the truce to carry out the murders. </p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>Before the cease-fire was signed, the government lifted a 
  ban on the rebels, and dismantled road blocks and removed checkpoints in Colombo, 
  making it easier for the rebels to move around. </p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>The rebels had been fighting for a separate state for 19 
  years, claiming discrimination at the hands of the majority Sinhalese. The conflict 
  killed at least 65,000 people, many of them civilians. While the cease-fire 
  put an end to the fighting, the rebels last week pulled out of peace talks, 
  stalling the island nation&#146;s peace process. </p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on Monday appointed a 
  committee to investigate the allegations after several Sri Lankan newspapers 
  reported on the killings. <a href="#_Toc40327031">[Top]</a></p>
<h3><a name="_Toc40326418"></a><a name="_Toc40327036">Human Rights Group Charges 
  That Ltte&#146;s Priority Has Now Become Assasinating Opponents Before The Coming 
  Elections</a></h3>
<p class=byline>By Walter Jayawardhana reporting from Los Angeles</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) after their most 
  recent peace discussions with the Ranil Wickremesinghe government at Hakone, 
  Japan had changed its priorities from child recruitment to assassinating its 
  political opponents before the elections, charged a leading human rights organization 
  in Sri Lanka. </p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>&#147;Their policy&#148; had now become, &#147;elections 
  and democracy, yes but after killing or crippling the remaining political opposition,&#148; 
  said University Teachers for Human Rights-Jaffna (UTHRJ)</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>In a 23 page report issued May 2, 2003 that painstakingly 
  documented details of many political killings by the LTTE, the human rights 
  group said even after the United States, now widely considered to be a key player 
  in the resolution of the Sri Lankan problem requested the LTTE to renounce violence 
  and also heaped praises on the peace process the LTTE appeared more confident 
  about killing its political opponents, with the Ranil Wickremesinghe government&#146;s 
  complicity regarding such matters taken for granted. </p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>In the report numbered 32 the UTHRJ charged Norway and Japan, 
  the main external actors dealing directly with the LTTE for not making the terrorist 
  group&#146;s assassinations and other attacks on its political opponents a critical 
  concern in the peace process. It said , &#147;Their bottom-line has appeared 
  to be that human rights must be pushed, but not beyond a point where the LTTE 
  might break off talks. This may partially explain why the LTTE&#146;s continuing 
  attacks on Tamil opposition groups has not featured as a critical concern in 
  the peace process, even though any entity promoting resolution of this conflict 
  would unhesitatingly acknowledge how critical democratic participation is to 
  lasting peace.&#148;</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>The report pointed out as far as the assassinations are concerned 
  the situation in the East has become so out of hand. It said, &#147;Having got 
  the message that the MoU will do little to prevent or punish political killings, 
  the LTTE is now quite open about it. Members of opposition parties, particularly 
  in the East, dare not leave their political offices. They visit their homes 
  at great risk. The incidents ... illustrate the kind of impunity the LTTE enjoys 
  now. Even in the heart of Batticaloa town, LTTE spies quite openly hang out 
  with cell phones. When they spot a target they summon the death squads who would 
  come promptly on motorcycles or auto rickshaws. Under the MoU, the LTTE&#146;s 
  political opponents have been deprived of the weapons they had for their protection, 
  while the LTTE goes about with arms and has shot people in public, while the 
  Police and the Army did nothing. In Jaffna things can be subtler and for that 
  reason more chilling.&#148;</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>The report also said in details that the LTTE after an year 
  of the Memorandum of Understanding with the Ranil Wickremesinghe government 
  now saw it had alienated the common people and saw it did not have a dependable 
  electoral base. The report said the terrorist group&#146;s absurd claim that 
  they were the sole representatives of the people was based on the Tamil National 
  Alliance&#146;s seats held by its grovelling MP&#146;s. This shaky foundation 
  was also demolished when the TULF leader Anandasangary asserted the independent 
  identity of the party. The report charged that LTTE political head P. Thamilselvan 
  had ordered now that that the TULF should get rid of Anandasangary as leader. 
  The report charged that the LTTE now wanted to use TULF as its front led by 
  Mavai Senathirajah as a LTTE front accepting few LTTE members in to the TULF. 
  The report called such an arrangement &#147;a Tiger in Sheep&#146;s clothing&#148;. 
</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>The report categorically said if the army was removed from 
  Jaffna town, the most popular Tamil politician who was elected with the highest 
  number of votes, V. Anadasangary and his supporters in the TULF&#146;s Stanley 
  Road office would not be safe.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>He reminded how a former mayor of Jaffna of the TULF was 
  killed by the LTTE left the Stnley Road office of his party close to army brigade 
  headquarters and moved to the Mayors office in Nallur. </p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>The UTHR(J) said, &#147;Contrary to hopes raised by the ceasefire 
  and the MoU, impunity persists in the North-East, especially on the part of 
  the LTTE. The two crucial and inseparable areas of violations that we have consistently 
  highlighted are child conscription and attacks on political opponents. The two 
  go on in parallel and independently of each other with slack periods followed 
  by periods of intense activity. At present child conscription appears to have 
  subsided while the LTTE&#146;s intelligence activity and targeted killings have 
  intensified, both in the North-East and the South, as the LTTE endeavours to 
  eradicate political opponents and military enemies. </p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>&#147;By the end of April newspapers were reporting that 
  at least 15 Tamils working as informants to the Sri Lankan military had been 
  killed since the beginning of the cease-fire in February 2002. The latest killing 
  occurred in Colombo on April 26<sup>th</sup>, causing the Government to launch 
  a long delayed investigation. Reports of surveillance, harassment, abduction 
  and murder of rival Tamil political party members have also increased.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>&#147;It appears that the LTTE has adopted a programme of 
  first things first. In Batticaloa after the Hakone talks, the LTTE spread the 
  word that whatever was said in the press about the peace talks, each family 
  was still required to provide a child recruit. But intense scrutiny on the issue 
  has made conscripting children outright more difficult. Since Hakone, the LTTE 
  has launched a renewed effort to silence independent local observers and political 
  groups. Their policy: elections and democracy, yes, but after killing or crippling 
  the remaining political opposition.&#148;<a href="#_Toc40327031">[Top]</a></p>
