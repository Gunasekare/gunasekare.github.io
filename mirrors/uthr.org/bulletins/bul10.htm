<h2> <a name="_Toc515550427">Introduction:</a> </h2>
<p>We last covered Trincomalee District in June 199 <span class=MsoHyperlink><span style='color:windowtext;
text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>(<a
href="..\Reports\Report13\Report13.htm">Report No.13)</a></span></span> just prior 
  to the election of the new government. About a week after the resumption of 
  war in April 1995, there was the major incident where the LTTE massacred more 
  than 40 migrant Sinhalese fisher folk at Kallaru(Kallara) near the northern 
  extremity of the district. The annual migration of these west coast fisher folk 
  during the south-west monsoon is a long established tradition (see for instance 
  Ceylon Census 1901). There was also an incident where the army went berserk 
  in the resettled Muslim village of Pudavaikkaddu, just south of Kallaru and 
  Thiriyai, killing five Muslim civilians. This followed an LTTE attack on the 
  soldiers. Since then Trincomalee has been relatively quiet on the surface. The 
  complacency was however shattered by the brutality and utter indiscipline displayed 
  by the army at Killiveddy on 11th February 1996. The lesson to be drawn here 
  is that it is dangerous to be complacent simply because&nbsp; violations by 
  the forces are few and far between, and more especially when nothing was done 
  about these violations. Most people are barely aware that these violations do 
  take place. </p>
<p>On 23rd February the army going into a quarry in Kanniya, west of Trincomalee 
  town, asked workmen whether they saw Tigers escaping that way. When the workmen 
  replied in the negative, four of them were made to lie down. Two married men, 
  Suppiah Rasendiram(31) and Arumugam Subramaniam(24), both of Technical Institute 
  Refugee Camp, Uppuveli were shot dead and Velayutham Subramanium was injured.&nbsp; 
  Complaints about such incidents are duly recorded by the MP for Trincomalee 
  and forwarded to the President and the Defence Ministry. Typically as we shall 
  see, nothing happens. Shortly after the outbreak of war in April last year, 
  two civilians were abducted in China Bay by men identified as being from the 
  nearby air force camp. The DIG Police in Trincomalee promised to inquire into 
  the matter and have the men released. To date nothing has happened. Following 
  the shooting of a Muslim homeguard by the LTTE in Mutur during May 1995, Muslim 
  hoodlums close to the armed forces killed three Tamils in reprisals. The Superintendent 
  of Police promised to take action against the miscreants who were identified. 
  Nothing happened. It also turns out that these hoodlums terrorised not just 
  the Tamil population, but also the Muslim population that does not want trouble 
  with the Tamils. On 10th August '95 at Senaiyoor, Kattaiparichchan, the army 
  called out and shot dead Pathiniyar Subramaniam(55) and Visvalingam Thavarajah(43). 
  An attempt to shoot the village headman was thwarted by women(the army has since 
  withdrawn from Kattaiparichchan). A complaint was made to the authorities by 
  the MP concerning this incident in the area under the Mutur Battalion. Nothing 
  is known to have been done beyond an acknowledgement of the complaint. Such 
  occasional incidents in a locality followed by&nbsp; long periods of calm is 
  bound to inspire complacency. The key question that needs to be asked is why 
  no action is taken? Why is no one held answerable? A closer look at the Killiveddy 
  incident suggests that the rot goes to the very top. Punishing a few of those 
  in the lower ranks, or more accurately getting them out of public view, does 
  nothing to change matters. </p>
<p>Since the outbreak of war, as a measure to strengthen deployment in the North, 
  the army has been withdrawn from some of the outlying areas. The army has been 
  withdrawn from coastal areas north of Kuchchaveli. Consequently the civilians 
  who were living in Thiriyai and Pudavaikkaddu have also abandoned their homes 
  and come into army controlled areas closer to town such as Nilaveli and Jamaliya. 
  In the south of the district the army has evacuated from Verugal, Ichchilampattai, 
  Sampur and Kattaipparichchan. The LTTE now moves freely in the villages just 
  east of, and south of Mutur town. These changes have no doubt made the army 
  feel insecure. For Tamil villages in the area, life has been made extremely 
  difficult. In a move apparently aimed at denying supplies to the LTTE, these 
  villagers have to come into Mutur daily to get their supplies and carry back 
  very restricted quantities of food and oil just enough for about a day. Typically 
  there are long queues of people carrying firewood on bicycles, who file past 
  check points into Mutur to sell their firewood and carry back supplies. In turn 
  people from Mutur hardly venture out and depend on those coming in for supplies 
  of firewood. The economy of those living in LTTE controlled areas is almost 
  one of primitive subsistence. Selling firewood to the town residents is their 
  main source of cash. </p>
<p>Until very recently women coming into town complained of being almost stripped 
  at check points by women service personnel. Any provocation by the LTTE is usually 
  replied with a volley of shells being fired into the LTTE controlled area. One 
  could easily guess how people in the LTTE controlled areas feel about the government 
  and the armed forces. </p>
<p>The Mutur sector is under the 22nd Brigade commanded by Brigadier Parami Kulatunge. 
  The eastern division is under the battalion commanded by Colonel Uthayakumara 
  based in Mutur, and the western&nbsp; division under Colonel Nihal Silva based 
  in Somapura(Kallar). Colonel Uthayakumara, when earlier based at Ichchilampattai 
  had a reputation for being a very reasonable and considerate officer. Nihal 
  Silva showed his ideological leanings when he was a major based in Mutur town.&nbsp; 
  In September 1994 he used his position to usurp the power of the civil administration 
  and personally supervise the settlement of Sinhalese encroachers on crown land 
  in Mutur town designated for public buildings. It is notable that even the local 
  Muslims who thought they had a powerful minister in M.H.M.Ashraff could make 
  no impact on the matter. This is in keeping with the&nbsp; not-so-hidden agenda 
  in Trincomalee District in which the central administrative machinery and the 
  military have worked in tandem&nbsp; for decades. </p>
<p>A healthier aspect of developments in the district is a certain communal amity 
  that has been coming about in recent times, which has remained unbroken despite 
  the strain of current violent events. Community and religious leaders have often 
  acted quickly to defuse tensions and prevent transient ill-feeling from getting 
  out of control. In this representatives from all communities, including some 
  members of the Buddhist clergy, have played a constructive role. </p>
<p>A recent event which led to some anxious expectations was the killing of Town 
  Councillor Sumathiratne in mid February. The gentleman was a Sinhalese fishing 
  merchant who appears to have been well regarded by the Tamils he employed. Most 
  people, including the local&nbsp; Sinhalese, put his death down to either cross 
  fire or mistaken identity during a skirmish between the LTTE and the army at 
  Sambalthivu. No one is too sure. </p>
<p>Sumathiratne's story must be set against the darker political motivations at 
  national level that have shaped developments in the area over the decades. But 
  it is also a story of how enlightened self-interest could have little truck 
  with communalism. Following the outbreak of war in June 1990, Tamil fisherfolk 
  and fish-merchants were completely ruined. With the Ministry of Rehabilitation 
  doing next to nothing for them, the gap was filled by Sinhalese entrepreneurs 
  like Sumathiratne. They provided capital to the Tamil fisherfolk and bought 
  their catch, deducting something regularly as repayment of capital. It was by 
  all accounts good business. Surviving in such situations also requires tricky 
  negotiations with all the forces in the area, and could be dangerous. Quite

<h3><a name="_Toc515550428">Kumarapuram, Killiveddy : Background</a> </h3>
<h4><a name="_Toc515550429">Locations:</a> </h4>
<p>Killiveddy lies about the 57th mile post on the northbound Batticaloa-Trincomalee 
  coast road after crossing Killiveddy Aru(River). The road then runs a further 
  mile north and comes to Dehiwatte Junction. It then proceeds 1 1/2 miles ENE(east-north-east) 
  with the bank of Allai tank to the right, past 59th mile post and comes to Palathadichchenai 
  (60 1/2th mile post) after a left bend. Mutur is a further 7 1/2 miles NNW. 
  A narrower road branches out from Somapura(formerly Kallar), off the Allai-Kantalai 
  Road, and runs north along the Allai LB main channel past LB3 settlement. It 
  then turns ENE through Dehiwatte colony and comes to Dehiwatte junction a further 
  mile ENE, where it joins the Batticaloa-Mutur (Trincomalee) Road. Killiveddy 
  River(or Kal Aru) itself branches off from Verugal River and flows into the 
  Allai Tank just east of Killiveddy village. LB3 which lies two miles west of 
  Killiveddy is also Tamil.(See map). </p>
<p>To get matters into focus, from Killiveddy village the Mutur Road runs a mile 
  north to Dehiwatte Junction, almost opposite which is Parathipuram (58th milepost). 
  The road then runs ENE to 59th milepost. An extension of the road in the opposite 
  direction from Dehiwatte Junction(i.e. WSW) leads a mile on to the edge of Dehiwatte. 
</p>
<p>Killiveddy is a very old village, south of which lie the predominantly Sinhalese 
  colony villages of the Allai scheme (late 50s). However Dehiwatte and Neelapola(formerly 
  Neelapalai) which lie to the northwest of Killiveddy are both Sinhalese colonies. 
  Neelapola lies at the northernmost tail end of the LB channel.The area is one 
  where Tamils have considerable interaction with the Sinhalese, and both communities 
  are bilingual. Relations have generally been good, with both communities attending 
  functions in each others' villages. With severe restrictions placed on Tamil 
  village shops, supposedly as a means of curtailing supplies reaching the LTTE, 
  Tamils regularly shop for groceries and items like batteries in the Sinhalese 
  and Muslim villages (eg. Thoppur). All these complicated arrangements for mutual 
  survival and welfare have given the three communities a strong vested interest 
  in continuing good relations. It is notable that the Sinhalese of the area have 
  been very much against the security forces being harsh with the Tamils, nor 
  has the LTTE attacked Sinhalese civilians in the area in any significant incident 
  since the late 80s. <a href="#_Toc515550426">[Top]</a></p>
<h4><a name="_Toc515550430">Kumarapuram:</a> </h4>
<p>Certainly by the late 60s, when the government installed an Air Force camp 
  about the head-works of Morawewa or Mudalikkulam in the west of&nbsp; Trincomalee 
  District, the issue of state sponsored colonisation of Sinhalese had come into 
  the open. The State had shown its hand and the issue had gone beyond the plane 
  of polite debate and of facts and figures. It is one of the main issues around 
  which the&nbsp; nationalist youth coalesced. Among the counter-measures to 'secure 
  the border areas' from further inroads by the state was to establish settlements 
  of Tamils on vacant lands in these areas. In towns and villages, loose coalitions 
  of activists worked in tandem to find new homes and occupations for Tamils displaced 
  by acute starvation on the estates in the mid-70s and then by the communal violence 
  of 1977 and 1981. From the onset of the civil war which followed the communal 
  violence of July 1983, the State and its forces did a great deal that makes 
  gory reading, not just to reverse such settlement efforts by Tamils, but also 
  to destroy old Tamil villages. </p>
<p>The residents of Kumarapuram themselves have diverse origins. Several of them 
  had come from the Hill Country. Some had first gone to Vavuniya during the 70s 
  and had then come to Kumarapuram. Others had come from Batticaloa District. 
  Some were landless folk from Killiveddy village itself. Kumarapuram is located 
  about half a mile from Killiveddy, about half the distance to Dehiwatte Junction. 
  The village was founded just after the communal violence of August 1981 by clearing 
  jungle to the east of the road, between the road and Allai Tank. The land itself 
  is not easy to cultivate. The people at Kumarapuram either cultivated vegetable 
  plots on land outside the village or worked as labour for the rice field owners 
  of Killiveddy. Unlike Killiveddy which produced a substantial educated middle-class, 
  those of Kumarapuram were very poor. </p>
<p>As the civil war gained in intensity, the Tamils of the area became displaced, 
  first in 1985 and again for a few months in 1990. Over this period a substantial 
  number of persons from Killiveddy fled to Western countries as refugees. The 
  number included Kumarathurai, who was among the key figures in founding Kumarapuram, 
  after whom it is named. Kumarathurai, as a known activist, was detained by the 
  army in January 1984 in a general tightening of repression. He was tortured 
  and released around mid-1986 when his village had for a time ceased to exist. 
  He is now a refugee in Denmark. The fratricidal tendency within the Tamil militant 
  movement also took its toll. The PLOTE had been the main movement established 
  in the area&nbsp; from the early 80s before even the LTTE was known in those 
  parts. After the LTTE's crackdown on the PLOTE in 1986, where recruitment is 
  concerned, the people have almost completely kept aloof. <a href="#_Toc515550426">[Top]</a></p>
<h4><a name="_Toc515550431">The first Killiveddy massacre and displacement:</a> 
</h4>
<p>During 1985 the Sri Lankan armed forces launched a general policy of terror 
  and displacement against Tamil villages in Trincomalee District, the signs of 
  which are all-too-visible to this day. The broken houses, the rusting frame 
  of the Government Paddy Stores and the ruined hull of the milk collection centre 
  are stark reminders of the former prosperity of the area against its present 
  penury. </p>
<p>On the night of 30th May 1985, a police party from Serunuwara entered Killiveddy-Akkarai 
  (South Bank) and took away 36 persons including women. They were massacred and 
  burnt at Sambalpiddy on the Allai-Kantalai Road. </p>
<p>On the same night itself the people of the area fled as refugees to places 
  such as Pachchanoor &amp; Thoppur, five miles away, and also to Trincomalee 
  town and beyond. The following morning(31st) the army came into Killiveddy village 
  along with police and homeguards and shot dead 8 mostly elderly persons, including 
  the Hindu priest's&nbsp; wife and a girl who had remained. </p>
<p>Was there another immediate context to the incident? We do also know that several 
  Sinhalese villages in the area, including Dehiwatte, were abandoned during that 
  period. Dehiwatte was attacked at least once by TELO. </p>
<p>May 1985 was a period just before then Indian brokered ceasefire of June when 
  things were very hot in the East. In the North there had been a number of massacres 
  and counter-massacres of civilians (eg. Valvettithurai and Anuradhapura, both 
  earlier in May 1985). On 9th February this year, the Deputy Minister for Defence 
  presented in parliament a report titled 'Massacre of Civilians' accounting for 
  about 2900 mostly Sinhalese civilians killed by 'armed terrorists' since November 
  1984. This listed attacks on Dehiwatte on 30.5.85 and 11.6.85 claiming respectively 
  5 and 13 Sinhalese civilian lives. There is of course no mention in the document 
  of the Killiveddy massacre on the first date given. </p>
<p>The Killiveddy incident received worldwide publicity when Mr. A.Thangathurai, 
  then ex-MP for Mutur and who is now MP for Trincomalee, spoke about it to the 
  correspondent of the London Times in Trincomalee. Just afterwards Mr.Thangathurai, 
  a native of Killiveddy, fled to Madras when the Minister for National Security 
  ordered his arrest 'for spreading false rumours'! </p>
<p>The survivors from Killiveddy returned when the Indian Peace Keeping Force 
  arrived in August 1987. The villagers fled again when the LTTE went to war with 
  the Sri Lankan Forces in June 1990 and were brought back about the end of 1990. 
</p>
<h4><a name="_Toc515550432">The situation just prior to the recent attack:</a> 
</h4>
<p>The army had two main camps in the area at 59th mile post, and at Dehiwatte. 
  A detachment from 59th Milepost under the command of a sergeant was posted at 
  the Killiveddy ferry-point. This unit was regularly rotated. This meant that 
  Dehiwatte Junction was fairly well covered from the three approach routes. There 
  were also the strategic army camps at Neelapola to the northwest and Mallikaitivu 
  to the north. The area around the junction is mostly open space, with Allai 
  tank to the east. For an LTTE party attacking troops in the area, the most natural 
  escape route is therefore towards Kankuveli and the Mahaveli River. This route 
  is south of the army camp at Neelapola. The other escape route is westwards 
  across the LB channel between the army camps at Dehiwatte and LB3. Trained professional 
  soldiers would therefore have had a very good chance of cutting off the attackers 
  as was no doubt intended by the military planners. Thus infiltration and escape 
  should normally have been very risky affairs. </p>
<p>During the day the soldiers readily came into Kumarapuram and Killiveddy villages 
  and mixed freely with the people, chatting and buying produce. The LTTE, sometimes, 
  came by night or summoned individuals by messages for inquiries elsewhere. Both 
  sides no doubt had their informers. People were regularly summoned for forced 
  labour by the army. The soldiers were well-known in the villages, and given 
  the current relatively disciplined behaviour of the troops, an atrocity such 
  as the one described below, was totally out of character. <a href="#_Toc515550426">[Top]</a></p>
<h4><a name="_Toc515550433">The massacre of 11th February 1996</a> </h4>
<p>About 5.00 p.m. Chokkalingam Stephen(51) from Kumarapuram with his wife and 
  a daughter were watering their patch of chilies at Dehiwatte Junction when two 
  soldiers from the Killiveddy detachment were bound thither from 59th Milepost. 
  They addressed Stephen by name, exchanged pleasantries with him and went on. 
  Just a little later firing noises were heard. Stephen's wife said that something 
  unpleasant had happened. Stephen went with his wife and daughter to one among 
  the few Tamil houses at the Junction that was predominantly a Muslim area. </p>
<p>Soldiers immediately ran from Killiveddy towards where the firing noises had 
  been heard. They then started firing wildly and taking reprisals. Among the 
  first victims were Kamaleswaran(13) and his employer Sivakolunthu Sinnathurai(about 
  60). The body of the latter was found the next morning with a leg severed. </p>
<p>The soldiers then went back towards Killiveddy, merged with others on the road 
  and went into Kumarapuram village. </p>
<p>Anthony Joseph(10) had gone to Killiveddy for tuition. His mother Moses Vijaya 
  had sent Tharmaletchumi(15), daughter of Arumaithurai(59), a girl next door, 
  to fetch her son. The latter was riding back to Parathipuram with Anthony on 
  the bicycle bar when the alarm was given. The two of them got into a nearby 
  shop along with others. Their gruesome fate will be described in the sequel. 
</p>
<p>As the soldiers came into Kumarapuram which was on the east side of the road, 
  people heard wild firing and frenzied shouts of 'Demala kattiya maranuwa'('Death 
  to the Tamils'). Thirupathy(45) ran eastwards, away from the road, with his 
  4 children, to the house of his sister Kamala(35). Then Kamala came running 
  holding the hand of her son Eeswaran (18) when he received a shot on his hand. 
  There were several people in Kamala's house with the doors and windows closed. 
  Soldiers fired through the doors and windows, while Thirupathy crouched under 
  a bed. Among those killed were Thirupathy's daughter Manjula(12) and Kamala's 
  daughter Sumathy(10). Two soldiers had entered the house through the front door 
  and another from behind. A young farmer who survived said that he could identify 
  the two soldiers who came through the front door. He had participated in forced 
  labour at the Killiveddy army detachment the previous day where he had seen 
  the two men. One of the soldiers came into the house with a knife. The other 
  pulled him back and sprayed the place instead with his automatic. </p>
<p>Soldiers then went to the house of Thiagarasa Thuraiyamma(65) further east. 
  14 people in the neighbourhood including children who had been playing near 
  the house had sheltered there with the doors and windows closed. Those in the 
  house included Thuraiyamma's daughters Parameswari(30) who was in an advanced 
  stage of pregnancy, and Vallippillai(25) holding her child of 1 1/2 years. Soldiers 
  forced the front door open and fired at the inmates through the door, as well 
  as from a side through a closed window. 7 in the house were killed including 
  Thuraiamma's two daughters above, another two adults and three children. Vallippillai's 
  1 1/2 old child survived. After the first round of firing ceased the children 
  who survived had screamed. This had provoked the soldiers into a second round 
  of firing. Thuraiyamma said that soldiers later entered the house and looted 
  about five sovereigns of jewellery that had been left with her for safe keeping. 
  After more than a week the house still had the strong stench of death, such 
  as was evident in Jaffna Hospital in the weeks following the incident of October 
  1987. There were bullet marks everywhere including holes in the roof. </p>
<p>Thangavelu Maruthai(57) saw the army coming towards her house. She called some 
  of the children who were playing near the house and got them inside. She then 
  stood at the door and pleaded with the soldiers not to shoot. The soldiers fired 
  inside and badly injured her father Govindhan(72). The father died shortly. 
  Also killed in that house was Stephen Padma(9), daughter of Maheswari(35).&nbsp; 
  Maruthai's brother Govindhan Palanivel fled from the house. The soldiers chased 
  him and fired at him, but he escaped with a minor injury. Maruthai could clearly 
  identify the two soldiers who came to her house. One was a dark man with a cut 
  on his face, known in the village as [Corporal] Kapila. The other was fair and 
  stocky. On previous occasions Kapila had been to her house asking for water. 
</p>
<p>Soldiers went around in this manner to several houses in the&nbsp; area leaving 
  behind death, injury and much physical destruction. In all 24 were killed including 
  7 children below the age of 12, the youngest being 3. The death toll would have 
  been higher had not many of the villagers run into the fields around. While 
  this was going on Stephen whom we had mentioned at the beginning, having left 
  his wife and child at Dehiwatte Junction, became extremely worried about his 
  other children. Of his 8 children 5 were at home. He cautiously moved towards 
  the village. He witnessed soldiers coming into the area also from Dehiwatte 
  and 59th Milepost army camps. In place of trying to chase after the Tigers who 
  had killed the two soldiers, this had all the hall-marks of an operation against 
  Kumarapuram. It was as though the soldiers from the other camps had come only 
  to give cover to their comrades doing their work at Kumarapuram or to join in 
  the destruction. The coming of soldiers from other camps was also witnessed 
  by others. When Stephen got home the next morning after spending an anxious 
  night in the surroundings, he found that his daughter Padma had been killed 
  by bullets which struck her full in the face. His daughter Letchumi(18) was 
  injured about the middle just above the leg. </p>
<p>Among the most gruesome of events took place in the twin grocery cum tea shop 
  just across the road from Kumarapuram. This was where Tharmaletchumi and Anthony 
  had taken shelter. Further behind the shop was an open space where children 
  were playing a ball game. Thambipillai Sittampalam(36), a labourer, when he 
  heard firing noises near Dehiwatte Junction called the children and got everyone 
  into the shop. Those in the shop included passers by and customers. From inside 
  the closed shop they first heard the click of soldiers' boots as they ran from 
  Killiveddy towards the location of the incident. A little later the soldiers 
  opened fire into the tea boutique killing Suthakaran(12). The people in the 
  tea boutique shifted to the grocery part. The soldiers then banged the grocery 
  door and shouted for the Mudhalali(owner) asking for 'gini petty'(boxes of matches). 
  The soldiers went to the back of the shop and asked everyone to come out. The 
  shopkeeper went out with his wife and child and they were not harmed. The soldiers 
  went into the grocery shop and opened fire closer to the ground level. Sittampalam 
  who was under a table saw streaks of light and then the shop was covered in 
  smoke. </p>
<p>Since the place was dark the soldiers found a mat, placed a dry palm leaf on 
  it and set it on fire. A soldier raised his automatic to fire when in the dim 
  light another noticed the fifteen year old girl Tharamaletchumi trying to creep 
  away and hide behind the others, some of whom were injured. He stopped the first 
  soldier who was about to fire. The soldiers then went out dragging Tharmaletchumi 
  along and took her to the broken down former milk collection centre on the same 
  side of the road about 30 yards towards Killiveddy. </p>
<p>While being forced out Tharmaletchumi pleaded that she was not from Kumarapuram, 
  but was from Parathipuram. Her 10 year old charge Anthony too went out shouting 
  Akka, Akka(Sister Sister), trying to cling to her. The soldiers shot Anthony 
  in the middle and left him for dead. Tharmaletchumi was gang raped on the grass 
  patch which must have been once the verandah of the building. The following 
  morning she was discovered shot dead. Her face had marks of the bestial passion 
  of her tormentors. She must have passed out by the time the men had finished 
  with her. More than a week later the place where the deed was done was marked 
  by a patch of dry blood that had caked in the sun. Anthony spent the night in 
  the open, injured and frightened. Only the next morning did he find himself 
  able to ask others who came out to restore him to his mother Vijaya. <a href="#_Toc515550426">[Top]</a></p>
<h4><a name="_Toc515550434">The Morning After:</a> </h4>
<p>Most villagers were too terrified and exhausted to move out of their homes. 
  Many of them had spent a crowded night with dead bodies among them. Some who 
  had managed to get out of the area had telephoned people in Trincomalee. The 
  MP for Trincomalee who had been in Colombo came to know about the incident early 
  in the morning. Killiveddy was his own village. The army did not allow people 
  into or out of the area until about 9.30 a.m. when it came to be known that 
  the brigadier of the twenty second group, which had its head quarters in Trincomalee, 
  and DIG Police/Trincomalee were coming to the area. At about 11.00 a.m. the 
  army came with buses and asked for the injured to be loaded inside, to be conveyed 
  to Mutur and Trincomalee. Stephen who had lost a child and two of whose children 
  were injured felt very angry when he found that the soldiers were from the same 
  area. He asked angrily, &quot;Were you shooting elephants or were you shooting 
  people?&quot;. The soldiers replied, &quot;Two of our boys were killed, so we 
  too went killing&quot;.&nbsp; The people refused to take the injured into the 
  buses until the ICRC which had arrived gave them an assurance of their safety. 
</p>
<p>The 28 injured were taken to hospitals in Mutur and Trincomalee. Autopsies 
  for the dead were performed in Mutur. The villagers said that the dead unborn 
  child was taken out of its dead mother Parameswary. Many of the 28 injured had 
  cut injuries and said that the soldiers had assaulted them with axes. Among 
  the children subject to axe injury, often on their face, were 2 children of 
  Nadarajah Kanapathipillai, Niroshan(6) and Thamesan(3).<a href="#_Toc515550426">[Top]</a></p>
<h4><a name="_Toc515550435">What was behind the incident?</a> </h4>
<p>The area in question came under the battalion commanded by Colonel Nihal Silva. 
  The rampage at Kumarapuram had started at about 5.30 p.m. and went on for about 
  two hours. From the events witnessed it was clear that the neighbouring camps 
  had been alerted and had come to the area. It would be extraordinary if Colonel 
  Silva had not been notified immediately. Why no attempt was made to bring the 
  soldiers under control is a question that needs to be answered. It is also significant 
  that the troops did not attack Killiveddy village itself or even the houses 
  at Dehiwatte Junction, but had instead targeted Kumarapuram whose people were 
  the poorest and the most vulnerable in the area. Was it sheer incompetence or 
  was it deliberate? Whether these matters are going to be answered by an official 
  inquiry is in question, given the record of cover ups. </p>
<p>Following the attack on a similar village , Mylanthanai, in the Batticaloa 
  District in 1992, where about 35 civilians were killed, this has been the first 
  attack on Tamil civilians of a comparable scale. Spontaneity does not seem to 
  explain this breach of relative discipline after more than 3 years. There have 
  been incidents in the Eastern Province where more than 30 soldiers were killed 
  in recent times and where the army conducted itself towards civilians with commendable 
  discipline. Many local observers are clear that this incident could not have 
  taken place without instigation from a higher level. We have reliable testimony 
  from several sources who are certainly not anti-government, that an officer 
  of considerable&nbsp; seniority had instigated the reprisals. The words he is 
  said to have used were to the effect, &quot;Turn the place into powder&quot;(&quot;kudu 
  karanda&quot;). </p>
<p>These sources also said that this officer was in the 59th Milepost army camp 
  when the shooting of the soldiers took place. He with a party of men tried to 
  proceed towards Dehiwatte Junction. They were prevented by firing from the LTTE. 
  Likewise a group that had tried to come from Dehiwatte too was prevented. Both 
  parties went to Dehiwatte Junction only after the LTTE had made their escape. 
  A CTB bus was stopped, made to pick up the bodies of the soldiers killed and 
  transport them to Dehiwatte army camp. The senior officer then went to Dehiwatte 
  army camp. The fact that soldiers at Killiveddy immediately proceeded to the 
  scene is also an indication that they did not expect the escaping the LTTE men 
  to come that way. </p>
<p>We also assert here that the Sinhalese in the area have been very much upset 
  by the incident and were full of sympathy for the people of Kumarapuram. Buddhist 
  monks in Trincomalee who were contacted had also expressed their grief. It is 
  also noteworthy that among those who visited Kumarapuram and consoled the people 
  was a Buddhist monk from the area. <a href="#_Toc515550426">[Top]</a></p>
<h4><a name="_Toc515550436">A case of Government inaction:</a> </h4>
<p>We have remarked earlier that complacency about what appeared to be occasional 
  and untypical violations, together with inaction on complaints about such, lies 
  the groundwork for a tragedy such as that which transpired at Kumarapuram. The 
  Government and the Defence Ministry had been given several indications that 
  something was terribly wrong in the area coming under the battalion commanded 
  by Colonel Nihal Silva. On 18/2/'95 the MP for Trincomalee complained by letter 
  to the President about the draconian manner in which the people of Kanguveli 
  were harassed&nbsp; by Lieutenant de Silva who was in charge of Neelapola army 
  camp. The complaint mentioned the humiliation and assault of people, the use 
  of forced labour to dig trenches and the regular abuse of people, including 
  women, in foul language. A reply was received from Chandrananda de Silva, Secretary, 
  Ministry of Defence, dated 9/5/'95. The reply denied all charges made against 
  Lieutenant de Silva. He was instead credited with being a good social worker 
  who organised shramadana(voluntary community service) for the improvement of 
  local agriculture. It was clear that there was no process of inquiry in which 
  the people and their representatives were involved. The reply to all practical 
  purposes was drafted by the likes of Colonel Nihal Silva. </p>
<p>What was happening was that complaints to the political authorities were routinely 
  passed on to the defence ministry, which then asked the army to investigate 
  complaints about itself. This was a parody of natural justice. It was because 
  of more than 10 years of blundering by an expanding military establishment that 
  there were calls to appoint, after many years, a civilian administrator as defence 
  secretary. The change however has not evinced greater sensitivity to the interests 
  of civilians than one has seen from retired generals. <br>
  &nbsp; </p>
<p>On 6th March 1995&nbsp; Sellappa Perinparajah of Kanguveli sent an appeal to 
  President Kumaratunge saying that he was in hiding from Lieutenant de Silva 
  who sought to take his life. This was backed by the MP's letter to the Deputy 
  Minister for Defence. Perinparajah had indicated that one of his sons had been 
  shot dead by the army during the 80s and another had joined a militant group. 
  Perinparajah was among the few in the area who dared to complain about the army's 
  behaviour to persons who would be able to pursue the matter. As it turned out 
  nothing was done. About early June 1995 another Perinparajah passing through 
  paddy fields near Neealapola army camp was abducted. His body was discovered 
  near an irrigation channel opposite Kanguveli, towards the Sivan Temple.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  Evidently it was realised that the wrong Perinparajah had been killed. About 
  12.00 noon on 24th June, S.Perinparajah was seen near the Mallikaithivu army 
  camp and was not seen alive thereafter. His body was found the following day 
  at Chakkaravattai, half a mile from Mallikaithivu along the Menkamam Road. The 
  tragedy was communicated by the MP to the authorities in Colombo. </p>
<p>On 26th June the MP&nbsp; lodged a complaint regarding Kidnapillai Prabakaran 
  and Chitravel Indran of Manalchenai, Mallikaithivu, who had been badly injured 
  as the result of being assaulted by the army. The army also prevented them from 
  being conveyed out of the area for medical treatment. All these are instances 
  of serious misdemeanours that had been communicated by responsible persons to 
  the authorities and where no restraint had been imposed on the conduct of military 
  officers and personnel. The message effectively&nbsp; given to them was that 
  all violations would be overlooked. It is a state of affairs where the repressive 
  power of the army increases in proportion to its ineffectiveness. </p>
<p>What transpired after the massacre at Kumarapuram lacks a sense of gravity 
  on the part of the authorities giving thus the impression of a cover up. The 
  military top brass were aware that something serious had happened. Yet, until 
  about 11.00 a.m. the next day no attempt was made to bring relief to the injured. 
  Colonel Nihal Silva continued to remain in charge of the area while a military 
  team which included his immediate superior, who too was answerable, was inquiring 
  into the matter. The only action taken was evidently to shuffle the men between 
  two neighbouring camps - according to some sources in the area, 59th Milepost 
  to Palatthadichenai and vice versa. The people were then supposed to identify 
  the culprits while the wolf remained in charge of the sheep pen. This was superfluous 
  once it was clear that the army was involved. </p>
<p>It was then up to the officers in charge to reveal why this had happened, why 
  they could not stop the rampage though it went on for two hours, what orders 
  they gave, who disobeyed, why there was no immediate relief brought to the injured 
  and so on. The tragedy had been in the making owing to neglect, indifference 
  or complicity from the very top. Would the demand of the people not to have 
  a repetition of such behaviour be addressed by merely punishing a few louts 
  for momentarily indulging in some of their base passions? Should not there be 
  a commission of inquiry to fully go into the institutional aspects of such tragedies? 
</p>
<p>As we release this report, we were given to understand that the Government 
  has instituted action on the basis of the committee's findings. We also understood 
  that the action may go further than what we have been accustomed to in the past. 
  If so the case for a full public inquiry by a commission is further strengthened. 
  We also understand that two soldiers have been remanded over the killing at 
  the&nbsp; quarry in Kanniya. <a href="#_Toc515550426">[Top]</a></p>
<h4><a name="_Toc515550437">Coverage in the press:</a> </h4>
<p>Towards the end of October 1995, the LTTE massacred civilians in a number of 
  villages towards the East when a sizeable contingent of the foreign press was 
  here to cover the military operation in Jaffna. The LTTE was readily blamed 
  for the massacres and foreign pressmen going to the Ministry of Information 
  and Tourism for their accredition were canvassed by officials to visit scenes 
  of LTTE atrocities. We believe that foreign coverage of these atrocities was 
  necessary to restrain the LTTE. But why this partiality as opposed to when Tamil 
  civilians are massacred? During those massacres by the LTTE some reports brought 
  out how LTTE cadre on the mission to massacre had gone among Sinhalese villagers 
  they knew well and even raped women whom they had moved among on friendly terms. 
  This was done by armed men in Kumarapuram as well. Should these not be treated 
  as part of the common brutalisation and degradation the whole country has been 
  going through, rather than place ethnic labels on individual events? </p>
<p>The reluctance to face up to tragedies that befall Tamil civilians is evident 
  in the way some correspondents covered the massacre. Even on the 16th of February 
  one major English daily gave headline prominence to security officials in Colombo 
  claiming that there was no evidence of army involvement in the massacre. More 
  than a week later the area had not been visited by any representatives of the 
  local mainline or the foreign press. </p>
<h4><a name="_Toc515550438">An Historical Note:</a> </h4>
<p>The agricultural region which forms the hinterland of Mutur was referred to 
  as the Province of Cottiar by colonial writers. It had a close connection with 
  Koneswaram temple in Trincomalee and is known to have been very prosperous for 
  much of the millennium until about the 18th century AD. Since the colonial era 
  beginning in the 16th century, the people of the region had the misfortune of 
  having their fate decided very much by external events and decisions taken elsewhere. 
  From the onset of the European colonial era, shipping from rival European powers 
  called regularly in the Bay of Cottiar for anchorage and resupply. The region 
  was then ruled by a Wanniar referred to by Baldaeus as the &quot;King of Cottiarum&quot;, 
  with the King of Kandy as suzerain. Tenant in his book on Ceylon quotes the 
  Dutch writer Valentyn who wrote that in 1675 there were constantly from 80 to 
  100 ships, bringing clothes and other wares from the Coromandel coast of South 
  India, to be bartered for arecanuts, palmyra sugar and timber. The country surrounding 
  the port of Mutur was then said to have been 'full of villages; rich in arable 
  and pasture lands; producing large quantities of rice for exportation, and importing 
  merchandise annually to the value of 1,00,000 pagodas'. But within a century 
  the country had fallen to ruin, mainly owing to conflict resulting from power 
  struggles involving rival European powers who also formed alliances with local 
  interests. </p>
<p>The state of the region is described in considerable detail by the Dutch resident 
  administrator at Trincomalee, J.F. Van Senden, in the diary of his visit in 
  June 1786 with a view to revitalising agricultural production. The population 
  then was a shadow of what it had been in times of prosperity. What he saw were 
  people who had lost much of their traditional skill and often living close to 
  subsistence level. It was also Van Senden who made the first record of the Kanguveli 
  Tamil inscription dealing with a large field dedicated to Koneswaram Temple. 
  He was struck by the contrast between the prosperity signified by the inscription 
  and what he then saw in the village. It was Van Senden&nbsp; who first contemplated 
  colonising the area. He was thinking of importing Chinese and Javanese labour 
  and then advised against it. He observed that the local inhabitants who had 
  suffered from years of misrule and anarchy were also feeling insecure, and were 
  easily provoked to rebellion. He also cited the assassination of his predecessor, 
  Schorer. Van Senden recognised that it would not serve the economic interest 
  of the colonial power to introduce changes while the people still felt insecure. 
</p>
<p>During the British era the first major irrigation works involving the Allai 
  Tank were completed in 1928 and there was a gradual revival of the prosperity 
  of the region. The first major colonisation effort was however undertaken after 
  Independence in the late fifties as part of the Allai Scheme. Most of the new 
  settlers came from Feeder Districts in the South chosen by the government. Tamil 
  representatives had constantly complained that giving preference to settlers 
  from outside the province was contrary to the Land Settlement Ordinance. Once 
  a majoritarian-nationalist ideological motivation took precedence in such schemes, 
  economics and the wellbeing of the people took second place. This motivation 
  was reflected in the case of Neelapalai which was first meant for people of 
  the area. During about early 1958 C.P. de Silva who was then the Minister concerned, 
  brought rough elements from colonisation schemes around Polonnaruwa and settled 
  them overnight at 'Neelapola'. RB1 was earlier given to Tamils and Muslims who 
  were displaced by the 1958 communal violence. The land was later given to Sinhalese. 
</p>
<p>However many of the local inhabitants benefitted from the scheme and the area 
  regained much of its former prosperity. Social relations between farmers from 
  different communities remained fairly good. But the eruption of State instigated 
  communal violence in the South during July 1983 had its repercussions in the 
  region. We have already described the depopulation and destruction wrought mainly 
  in the Tamil areas and the primitive conditions to which&nbsp; the Tamil people 
  have once more become subject. Whatever else had changed over the last 200 years, 
  if Van Senden were to come again he would readily recognize the people whom 
  he had then described as being sullen and rebellious. </p>
<p>The current situation resulted because the ideological orientation of the State 
  did not allow it to deal with the Tamil problem in a rational manner. When youths 
  are rounded up in Trincomalee today those from Mutur are more suspect of having 
  insurgent leanings, and security forces personnel often speak of&nbsp; Mutur 
  as being the home of the LTTE. If there is any truth in this, it reflects the 
  ineptness of the State. To start with the LTTE hardly had any base in the region. 
  The militant loyalties of the population were mainly PLOTE and TELO in that 
  order. When the LTTE struck against the other groups in 1986, the population 
  in that area would normally have become hostile to the LTTE. This is again reflected 
  in the present aloofness of many villages. But on the other hand, the government 
  forces had already subjected most of the villages to violence and displacement. 
  Owing to this situation the people had no alternative but in some sense to develop&nbsp; 
  sympathy for the LTTE, which is the only group that is fighting the State now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;As we had pointed out, the people of all communities are tired of the 
  war and have shown a determination to resist the resurgence of communal violence 
  among themselves. This provides an opportunity for peace provided the political 
  initiative is advanced with sensitivity. But firstly the armed forces need to 
  be subject to strict control and the people need to see that there is a determination 
  by the State to respect human rights and be accountable. &nbsp; <a href="#_Toc515550426">[Top]</a></p>
