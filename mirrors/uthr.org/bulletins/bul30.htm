      wasn't so much that criticism was dangerous; it was pointless. Still I never

    <p><font size="-1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b><i><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>&quot;In 
      general all people who were independent or who stuck to their own opinions 
      were roughly handled or put to the side when the time came for favours. 
      You could be boycotted; you could be driven out of business. These things 
      were noticed by most people, who learned from the fate of others. It was 
      pure force applied to politics and it meant that the Nazis got anything 
      they wanted&#133;[Such were the reflections of people who lived through 
      the Nazi take-over&#133;]</span></i></b></font></p>
    <p><font size="-1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b><i><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>&quot;Perhaps 
      the basic reason for [the absence of resistance] was that there was no Nazi 
      Coup d'etat. Instead there was a series of quasi-legal actions over a period 
      of at least six months, not one of which by itself constituted a revolution, 
      but the sum of which transformed Germany from a republic to a dictatorship. 
      The problem was where to draw the line. But by the time the line could be 
      clearly drawn, the revolution was a fait accompli, the potential organs 
      of resistance had been individually smashed, and organised resistance was 
      no longer possible. In short, the splendid organisation [of the socialist-led 
      Reichsbanner for the protection of the Republic] was to no avail; in the 
      actual course of events it was every man for himself&#133;.&quot;</span></i></b></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>The 
  international funding gathering for the GoSL and LTTE, hosted in freezing Oslo 
  on 25<sup>th</sup> November, ended on a note of confidence in the peace process. 
  The fly in the ointment with consequences yet to unfold was India declining 
  to participate. The LTTE leader's Martyrs' Day speech on the 27<sup>th</sup> 
  that followed with a conditional renunciation of separatism was interpreted 
  as an additional bonanza.</span></font><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'> 
  </span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>There 
  is however no promise of a season of goodwill and reconciliation even though 
  putative leaders smile and shake hands. The cease-fire and removal of travel 
  restrictions in government-controlled areas have eased the day to day life of 
  civilians, leading to a semblance of normality. But significant sections of 
  the people in the North-East are anxious and feel their very right to exist 
  threatened by this peace process. Many more feel condemned to a long drawn-out 
  period of political and moral suffocation under a totalitarian dispensation. 
  </span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>In 
  the country as a whole the supporters of the process and its opponents, driven 
  together though they have very little in common, are digging behind frozen positions. 
  Almost nothing is being done to challenge the chauvinist ideologies on both 
  sides that are at the root of the conflict. If anything they are being strengthened 
  by the growing feelings of insecurity of their base. The admission of any wrong 
  doing by their side with a view to correction is seen as fatal to their interests. 
  What is more surprising is the current role of civil society and sections in 
  the South generally regarded as more objective, open and enlightened.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>The 
  two incidents at Kanjirankudah and Trincomalee that we dealt with in our last 
  bulletin, where the victims were Tamil civilians, are now treated as closed 
  affairs. Versions circulated, a commission report and a magistrate's report 
  exonerate the security forces. Their glaring deficiencies have not been challenged. 
  On top of these comes the chill wind of the High Court verdict on the Mahilanthanai 
  Massacre of 9<sup>th</sup> August 1992 in the Batticaloa District, close to 
  the Polonnaruwa border. </span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>In 
  the face of international pressure, the case was taken up 8 months after the 
  massacre against a record of routine covering up. After the identification parade 
  before the Batticaloa magistrate on 2<sup>nd</sup> April 1993, the case was 
  moved to the Polonnaruwa Magistrate's Court. This was done by the Attorney General, 
  the present Defence Minister, on a plea on behalf of the accused that they were 
  not safe in Batticaloa. The victims' plea to the Appeal Court that they could 
  not function in security in Polonnaruwa was refused on 10<sup>th</sup> October 
  1993. On 8<sup>th</sup> March 1994, the Polonnaruwa Magistrate found that there 
  was a case against 21 soldiers and referred the matter to the Attorney General. 
  </span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>The 
  hearings on Mahilanthanai finally began at the Colombo High Court on 2<sup>nd</sup> 
  October 2002 with the bench comprised of the Tamil judge Sri Skandarajah. The 
  accused requested an all-Sinhalese-speaking jury, which the Judge allowed. The 
  Jury of seven gave their verdict on 25<sup>th</sup> November, unanimously declaring 
  all the 18 accused army personnel not guilty, the other three being dead. The 
  Judge, who disagreed, instructed the Jury again and sent them back to reconsider 
  their verdict. The Jury came back with the same verdict. </span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>For 
  those who followed the proceedings in the Tamil Press the verdict was a matter 
  for shock and disbelief. The witnesses had unflinchingly described their harrowing 
  experiences and identified the culprits. To the families of the 35 dead and 
  the 46 witnesses, 42 of whom remain refugees from the time of the tragedy, it 
  has been an unconscionable ordeal of ten years at the end of which justice was 
  denied. In the South, the verdict has been greeted with silence rather than 
  indignation. There will no doubt be a heavy political price to pay. </span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Earlier on 31<sup>st</sup> October 
  the Colombo High Court judge Ambeypitiya sentenced LTTE leader Velupillai Prabhakaran 
  to 200 years of rigorous imprisonment for the destruction of the Central Bank 
  in January 1996. Even competent laymen can argue that the case is not watertight. 
  But this may not create a problem, as few would seriously contest Prabhakaran's 
  guilt. Even among the Tamils, many would deem Prabhakaran many times guiltier 
  for what he has done to his own people, but that judgement is political and 
  moral rather than judicial. The judicial conviction was based on a confession 
  by a Black Tiger (allowed under the PTA) who was also convicted, the identification 
  of fingerprints on a farewell plaque for the former as Prabhakaran's by comparing 
  with those taken in India 20 years ago, and inferences drawn from these.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>The 
  Mahilanthanai judgement that followed throws the Sri Lankan system of justice 
  into ridicule and reinforces the view among Tamils that the judicial system 
  is hopelessly biased against them. The Mahilanthanai case, in contrast, was 
  founded on solid and numerous eyewitness accounts of persons who had persisted 
  through ten years of poverty, loss and intimidation. There was little left to 
  inference. </span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>In 
  comparison with the copious laudatory comments on the verdict on Prabhakaran, 
  there was just one in the English Press on Mahilanthanai. A weekend paper on 
  1<sup>st</sup> December carried on its front page an emotional picture of a 
  discharged soldier with his family. It was captioned: <i>&quot;End of an ordeal&#133; 
  after the Colombo High Court discharged him and his mates on a unanimous verdict 
  of the jury&quot;.</i> The real victims had ceased to exist. It was more insidious 
  than simple amnesia, as will be readily seen by outsiders. This is just one 
  instance of the heavy price paid for trying to defend falsehood. But this is 
  the season of falsehood galore.<a href="#_Toc26706405">[Top]</a></span></font></p>

lang=EN-GB>2. Conning in Bangkok's Rose Garden</span></b></a></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>Earlier 
  too, the second round of peace talks between the two parties in Thailand ended 
  on an optimistic note on 3<sup>rd</sup> November. Answering a question posed 
  by a journalist, the LTTE spokesman Anton Balasingam said that the LTTE would 
  'accept and assimilate' other political groups that operate in the North-East 
  since it was the LTTE's intention to enter the political 'mainstream'. However 
  the reality on the ground is that since those pledges were made, attacks on 
  the opposition by the LTTE operatives have increased. The new weapon in vogue 
  among these 'political cadre', complementing organised 'people's protests', 
  is the sword - a handy weapon to maim and intimidate if not to kill (see below 
  for details).</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Balasingam's assurances have a weird 
  history and he is conscious of making history, even if he may not always be 
  privy to what exactly the Leader, Prabhakaran, would do next. He said in early 
  1990 that they would embrace the EPRLF once the last Indian soldier left Sri 
  Lanka. The Indian Army left. Then on 19<sup>th</sup> June 1990, soon after the 
  Leader recommenced war, many senior EPRLF central committee members, including 
  their charismatic leader Padmanabha, were gunned down while holding a meeting 
  in Madras. A few weeks later Balasingam appealed to India saying that their 
  involvement is necessary to solve the problem in this country. Nine months later, 
  Rajiv Gandhi, who was on the threshold of becoming India's Prime Minister, was 
  killed by an LTTE suicide bomber. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Balasingam apparently assuaged Sinhalese 
  anxieties in Bangkok by saying that the LTTE is 'keen to move into the core 
  issues' and did not presently see the need for an Interim Administration in 
  the North-East. But the reality is that its control on the ground has gone beyond 
  anything envisaged in an interim entity. In Jaffna it virtually controls the 
  Sri Lankan Police. It orders about administrators, local councils and educational 
  officers at will and, occasionally, even cabinet ministers. It controls schools 
  and through the education department in Batticaloa has distributed portraits 
  of the Leader to be hung up in schools in lieu of the Head of State. LTTE spokesmen 
  (e.g. Puli Thevan) have said elsewhere that the political content of a settlement 
  will have to account for the fact that the LTTE has already an army, navy, police 
  and an 'administration'.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>The 
  LTTE has been widely criticised recently for bloating its 'army' by the conscription 
  of children. An unfazed Balasingam once more repeated the claim, first made 
  by the Leader at the 10<sup>th</sup> April press conference, that many underage 
  children have been released to their parents. The reality is that while token 
  releases of children have been made for publicity, many others have been escaping 
  from the 'Eelam Army', and children have continually been conscripted even as 
  LTTE leaders have voiced pledges to the contrary.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>It 
  is against this backdrop that the Government and the LTTE have agreed to set 
  up three sub-committees including one to canvass funds from foreign donors and 
  undertake the rehabilitation of the North-East. Clearly, while there may be 
  commercial opportunities for some government ministers and their agents in Colombo, 
  the actual control on the ground will be exercised solely by the LTTE. The Government 
  apparently could not care less and Norway and the International Community have 
  allowed totalitarian control to take root before their very eyes.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>The 
  LTTE has for some time been bringing local and international NGOs effectively 
  under its control. Veiled warnings have been given to those who persisted in 
  keeping their independence or tried to take up the issue of children. With the 
  connivance of Norway and the Sri Lankan Government, the LTTE has in effect created 
  a situation where the rehabilitation of war-affected children, and of child 
  soldiers whom the LTTE is pledged to disband, will entirely be in its hands!</span></font></p>

  Norway-Sponsored Public Relations</span></b></a></font></h3>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>The 
  long-running tragedy of the LTTE's use of child soldiers has drawn much global 
  attention. Hopes that this problem is being dealt with successfully have been 
  raised by international organisations against new pledges and claims made by 
  the LTTE. In raising this issue we have always sought to go deeper because it 
  has a whole series of ramifications. Child conscription activity, along with 
  extortion and attacks on dissent, go to the heart of the LTTE's relationship 
  with the people. Trying to deal with it in isolation of the broader issues of 
  human rights and the LTTE's ideology will continue to yield results that are 
  transparently deceptive.<a href="#_Toc26706405">[Top]</a></span></font></p>
<h3><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><a name="_Toc26706409"><b><span
lang=EN-GB>3.1 Basic conditions of child rehabilitation:</span></b></a><b><span
lang=EN-GB> </span></b></font></h3>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>Psychologist 
  Dr. Elizabeth Jareg, advisor to <b>Save the Children Fund</b>, spoke to the 
  <i>Sunday Times</i> (29.09.02) on the rehabilitation of ravaged children. Referring 
  to the social and cultural vacuum that comes with peace, she said that it is 
  often filled with undesirable activity, such as being drawn to watch gruesome 
  video shows. This is an LTTE speciality in children's entertainment. It is all 
  the time invading schools and community centres and setting up commemorations 
  to show its 'action' videos. The symbolism with which it adorns even children's 
  parks can only be described as gruesome.</span></font></p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>Dr. 
  Jareg added that it was impossible to get involved in rehabilitation projects 
  without a clear commitment to disarm. <b>She said that children have to be completely 
  in civilian hands if they are to benefit.</b></span></font></p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>Can 
  such conditions be even remotely met under LTTE supervised rehabilitation of 
  children? No less important are the questions on which the outcome of the entire 
  peace process hinges: Is the LTTE serious in its commitment not to recruit children 
  or at least not to take them in forcibly? Is it serious about its pledge to 
  discharge child soldiers and restore them to their families; or, do child soldiers 
  remain an important component of its 'army' to maintain a show of 'strength' 
  against the Government?<a href="#_Toc26706405">[Top]</a></span></font></p>
<h3><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><a name="_Toc26706410"><b><span
lang=EN-GB>3.2 The LTTE's position:</span></b></a><b><span> </span></b></font></h3>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>Apart 
  from general statements made by top LTTE leaders, claims of a more specific 
  nature have emerged from Mr.Sinniah, an LTTE representative on the SLMM's Local 
  Monitoring Committee (LMC) in Batticaloa, and from Jay Maheswaran, LTTE representative 
  in the Thai and Oslo peace talks and from the LTTE's rehabilitation unit. Mr.Sinniah's 
  claims are given in Section 4.4 of our <a href="../SpecialReports/spreport15.htm">Special 
  Report No 15</a>. Maheswaran made his remarks on the final day of the conference 
  on child rehabilitation organised by <b>Save the Children Fund</b> at the BMICH 
  from 1<sup>st</sup> to 3<sup>rd</sup> October.</span></font></p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>Their 
  version is essentially that the LTTE does not recruit children and has only 
  temporary custody of children who came to them on their own. These, they claimed, 
  were children who faced problems at home due to such causes as poverty and marital 
  breakdown. The LTTE, they averred, was looking after these children and intended 
  restoring them to their families when the latter are in a position to have them. 
  Most surprisingly, the SLMM's head, General Trond Furuhovde's reading of the 
  situation went far to support the claims of these LTTE functionaries.<a href="#_Toc26706405">[Top]</a></span></font></p>
<h3><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><a name="_Toc26706411"><b><span
lang=EN-GB>3.3 SLMM's General Furuhovde on child soldiers</span></b></a></font></h3>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>General 
  Furuhovde, the Norwegian government appointee who heads the SLMM, talked about 
  child soldiers when he addressed the Foreign Correspondents' Association in 
  Colombo over dinner on 30<sup>th</sup> September. While saying that the LTTE 
  was allowing underage combatants to return home, he contented that more needed 
  to be done (see AFP report, <i>Daily Mirror</i> 5.10.02).</span></font></p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>Furuhovde 
  said it was important to understand the circumstances that led to the recruitment 
  of child soldiers and it was not a mere <i>'black and white'</i> issue. </span></font></p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>He 
  said that poverty had forced some children to join the rebels. Demobilisation 
  of child soldiers, about which he said that the LTTE was serious, was now posing 
  challenges to humanitarian agencies in an area where there were hardly any facilities 
  to rehabilitate them. <i>&quot;The LTTE needs support in the way they are adjusting 
  to a changing situation&quot;</i>, Furuhovde said, <i>&quot;It is important 
  they get the support. Sending the child soldiers home was not sufficient and 
  they need support to integrate in society and go back to school.&quot;</i></span></font></p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>Remarkably, 
  much of this can usefully be said by LTTE spokesmen at funding sessions such 
  as the one hosted in Oslo. According to correspondents present at the dinner, 
  the General made it fairly clear that maintaining the cease-fire should receive 
  priority over human rights - a position he may have modified later in October 
  (see <a href="bul29.htm">Bulletin No.29</a>). </span></font></p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>We 
  will examine the current situation by addressing the claims above one by one. 
  Firstly, if demobilisation of children were the current norm, one would at least 
  expect that orders have gone down the line not to conscript or recruit children.</span></font></p>
<h3><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><a name="_Toc26706412"><b>3.4 
  Internal orders and public relations:</b></a><b><span lang=EN-GB> </span></b></font></h3>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>During 
  late October, nearly four weeks after Furuhovde's speech, Karuna, the military 
  commander for the East gave instructions to his local area leaders. He once 
  more asked them to expedite the compiling of maps and videos of security forces 
  camps in their area. We had earlier (<a href="../SpecialReports/spreport15.htm">Special 
  Report No.15</a>) quoted him telling those who had been confined to barracks 
  on the completion of training not to be impatient and that they will see action 
  soon.</span></font></p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>Karuna 
  also asked his local leaders to swell their numbers by exerting themselves more 
  zealously in conscription. We reliably understand that the local leaders made 
  known their unhappiness on this score, since their conscription activity has 
  been meeting with increasingly determined resistance from the populace. A greater 
  number of them have been complaining promptly to the SLMM and this creates problems 
  for the LTTE.</span></font></p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>On 
  31<sup>st</sup> October the LTTE in Batticaloa summoned village headmen, <i>Samurdhi 
  </i>and Rural Development Society officials from several areas to a meeting 
  at its office in Karadian Aru. These areas included Pavatkodichchenai, Karadian 
  Aru, Illupadichchenai and Koduwamadhu. They were addressed by the political 
  head, Kausalyan. They were pressed to find recruits and told that these persons 
  must be delivered to locations as instructed.</span></font></p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>During 
  the same period an apparently contradictory message was given to journalists 
  summoned for a meeting at the Kokkadichcholai office of the LTTE. Addressing 
  them, Kausalyan and Ramanan said that the fighting is over and now it is time 
  for warfare in educational advancement and economic upliftment. The journalists 
  were told that they must firmly be with the LTTE. The LTTE has also, we understand, 
  issued instructions to compile lists of families that have contributed a member 
  to the LTTE's military cause. They have been promised a house and Rs. 1 lakh 
  in cash upon the LTTE acquiring the North-East administration. </span></font></p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>About 
  10<sup>th</sup> November Karuna, after he returned from the 2<sup>nd</sup> round 
  of talks in Bangkok, addressed many of his subordinates in Tharavai. This time, 
  according to LTTE sources, he acknowledged the difficulties in carrying on the 
  kind of forced conscription begun in August 2001. He asked them to use methods 
  of enticement that the privileged position of the organisation and its new access 
  to resources would permit. These include promise of privileges for the family 
  and social importance coming from power and vehicles in which to run about. 
  At the same time, he told them that the peace process will not last and there 
  will be war. What this dual approach shows is adaptation and a change of tactics 
  rather than of substance. Strengthening the LTTE's totalitarian control has 
  counterbalanced any restraint imposed by monitoring mechanisms.<a href="#_Toc26706405">[Top]</a><b>

  new life away from her former home. Such problems are inherent when the LTTE 
  blindly conscripts children having close relatives with different political 
  convictions, whom it treated brutally. (See three further cases of torture of

lang=EN-GB>3.7 Martyrs' Day, 27<sup>th</sup> November, a Change of Tactics:</span></b></a></font></h3>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>New 
  difficulties over conscription arose from people becoming more familiar with 
  monitoring mechanisms as pointed out. International concern too was something 
  the LTTE could not disregard blatantly. Conscription activity was at low key 
  during November, while the LTTE directed most of its energies in preparing to 
  observe Martyrs' Day on a grand scale. Its control of the administration, local 
  councils and all other aspects of public life was used to full effect in making 
  the occasion a grand carnival. In towns, schools (Mahajana College in Batticaloa) 
  were used as centres for exhibition of pictures of dead cadres.</span></font></p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>Organisations, 
  clubs and businesses were ordered to provide cash. In Batticaloa, special lighting 
  was ordered from Colombo and there was music, fanfare and drama. Obeying orders 
  from their new masters, government servants came well-dressed, wearing tie, 
  to act as ushers and helpers. It was an intrusion into the people's lives and 
  purses that they resented, but a high attendance was ensured.</span></font></p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>School 
  children were the group specially targetted by the LTTE. The 27<sup>th</sup> 
  being a school day, many parents kept their children at home. Those who went 
  often got lost in the carnival atmosphere. Several children who went to school 
  in Kalmunai ended up attending the ceremony in Kanjikudichcharu and returned 
  home the following morning. More would have gone but for the fact that the LTTE 
  could not muster enough transport. It is too early to assess its effects, but 
  one report from Batticaloa may prove the tip of the iceberg, even though the 
  immediate impact of the festivities on recruitment appears very low key.</span></font></p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>Five 
  boys who went for the exhibition at Mahajana College, Batticaloa, together joined 
  the LTTE. The parents of one boy who was 14 or 15 were at a loss where to find 
  him and went to both the ICRC and the SLMM. They both reportedly told the parents 
  to find out in which camp the child was and they would try to get him out. The 
  parents contacted well wishers whom they hoped would have some influence and 
  also went to Senathy, the political head of the LTTE in Batticaloa. They told 
  Senathy that the boy was their only son. Senathy gave them a letter to the LTTE's 
  Kokkadichcholai office requesting to find the boy. The parents delivered the 
  letter and in good time the boy was delivered at home.</span></font></p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>And 
  so Senathy earned a name for being reasonable and accommodative. However, the 
  same sources said that of the five boys two were released and three are with 
  the LTTE. The LTTE's right to take in underage children will not be questioned, 
  but the LTTE will play it by ear, case by case, depending on who is pursuing 
  the matter and what influence they have. Senathy, as our earlier reports would 
  show, was involved in forced conscription in its crudest forms while he was 
  area leader in Valaichenai.</span></font></p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">We have pointed out that 
  once the LTTE is given the full powers of a totalitarian state, it would not 
  need to conscript children by crude force. It will surround itself with an aura 
  of divine authority and use persons from university lecturers, religious leaders, 
  senior government officers and school principals to inveigle other people's 
  children into the organisation. It happened in Jaffna in the early 1990s. The 
  children of university dons who unexpectedly joined the LTTE were released as 
  a special favour, while some professors acted as pied pipers, piping to other 
  people's children.<span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'><a href="#_Toc26706405">[Top]</a></span>

<h3><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span></span><a name="_Toc26706416"><b>4 
  How Serious is the LTTE About Releasing Children?</b></a></font></h3>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>So 
  far the LTTE has not responded to specific complaints on conscription raised 
  by the SLMM in Batticaloa. In Batticaloa, moreover, the SLMM has started receiving 
  a spate of complaints from parents of children who were conscripted before the 
  signing of the MoU in February. The LTTE representatives on the LMC have resisted 
  the position of others that these complaints fall within the purview of the 
  SLMM. In signing the MoU, the LTTE agreed to respect International Law that 
  makes it unlawful for it to hold persons against their will, more especially 
  those who are underage. </span></font></p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>An 
  even greater travesty of International Law is to punish recaptured escapees 
  by brutal torture, or to hold parents or siblings of escapees hostage (see especially 
  <a href="../SpecialReports/spreport14.htm">Special Report No.14</a>). <i>The 
  Sunday Times</i> of 17<sup>th</sup> November carries the grief-stricken picture 
  of Mrs. Rasvalli Kovindasamy, whose husband Kandiah Kovindasamy was taken hostage 
  by the LTTE on account of their escapee son Rajeevan. She sought the SLMM's 
  help to obtain the signature of her husband, a government employee, so that 
  she could collect his salary. A further recent case, of Sothy of Pt. Pedro, 
  is given below in Section 14.2.</span></font></p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>It 
  is a game with no end in sight. The optimists reason that by pushing the LTTE 
  to make token releases of children from time to time, they might precipitate 
  the real thing. The LTTE's reasoning is no doubt the opposite - that token releases 
  of a couple of dozen would confuse international opinion and stave off concerted 
  action against their organisation.</span></font></p>

  of Olara Ottunu's UN mission on child soldiers. However, <b>&quot;The Coalition

<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>At the date this report

<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>Further 
  in a press release issued on 7<sup>th</sup> November 2002, &quot;The Coalition

<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>&quot; The Coalition's 
  own report urges the Secretary-General and the Security Council to ensure that 
  Resolution 1379 is used to its maximum potential -<br>
  recognising that some of the countries with the most severe child soldier<br>
  problems, such as Myanmar, Colombia and Sri Lanka, are at serious risk<br>
  of being excluded from the Secretary-General's report&#133;..<br>
  ..</i></font></p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>Children as young as 
  eleven are forcibly recruited into Myanmar's<br>
  national army. With an estimated 70,000 children in its ranks, it is the world's<br>
  largest single user of child soldiers. In Colombia, there are an<br>
  estimate 6,000 to 14,000 child soldiers. Boys and girls as young as 8 years 
  old<br>
  are recruited into armed groups, paramilitaries and militias. In Sri Lanka,<br>
  the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) has a long record of using<br>
  child soldiers as well as a record of breaking commitments to end their<br>
  recruitment and use&#133;&#133;</i></font></p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Further, mounting evidence 
  of child recruitment by the LTTE was brought to the public domain by prominent 
  organisations, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. But 
  the LTTE spokesman Anton Balasingam and its propaganda machine continue to deny 
  these reports. Moreover, Balasingham has been privileged to make these denials 
  in public fora alongside government representatives from Norway and Sri Lanka. 
  This unusual concurrence shows two things. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">For the Government, as 
  with the LTTE, human rights and other issues of propriety are tactical weapons 
  to be used against the adversary when it suits them. They have no real commitment 
  to these values. At present they both are on the same side, covering up for 
  and propping up one another for their short-term political survival. But Norway 
  portrays herself as a front-runner in human rights and, especially, child rights. 
  For her to exploit her image to whitewash and legitimise a totalitarian force 
  as part of strategic calculations in &quot;peace making&quot;, is bound have 
  enormous repercussions. Being wilfully blind to the stark context in Sri Lanka 
  will have grave implications for the region's future. One hopes before it is 
  too late, that Norway will see it in her wisdom that the road to real peace 
  lies in demanding accountability from all the actors, especially the Sri Lankan 
  state and the LTTE, and not in strategic appeasement.<span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'><a href="#_Toc26706405">[Top]</a></span>

lang=EN-GB>5 The LTTE and the uses of deprivation</span></b></a><b><span
lang=EN-GB> </span></b></font></h3>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>There 
  are many ways in which people have faced deprivation because of the war: through 
  loss of breadwinners in general warfare; massacres and disappearances caused 
  by the security forces, the LTTE and other armed groups in that order; massive 
  displacement, and through restrictions on economic activity. Insecurity and 
  humiliation at the hands of the state forces comprised the major thrust for 
  thousands of youths to join the various militant movements. Disillusionment 
  and betrayal was the feeling many experienced during the latter part of the 
  1980s. </span></font></p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>The 
  LTTE's totalitarian politics destroyed all healthier values of the struggle, 
  which became paralysed by cynicism. In facing the loss of active support from 
  the mature, the LTTE deliberately contrived at deprivation and vulnerability 
  to sustain its military machine. This marked the advent of child soldiers and 
  women fighters! </span></font></p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The possibility that children 
  from vulnerable groups joined the LTTE through poverty-related causes cannot 
  be discounted. But the larger issue concerns an organisation consciously using 
  the deprivation among particular groups of children to conscript them by devious 
  means. It further raises ominous questions of character regarding the leading 
  sections of today's global Tamil civil society, for conniving with this outrage 
  rather than resisting it firmly. The very nature of conscription that is in 
  evidence and the regular escapes from training camps are a strong indication 
  that poverty is not the motive force and something else is happening now. The 
  needs of child rehabilitation too cannot be assessed without an independent 
  study by qualified persons.<span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'><a href="#_Toc26706405">[Top]</a></span>

  was ordered to hand over half the government rations for the people to the LTTE. 
  He ignored the order and distributed the goods routinely among smaller co-ops. 
  When the LTTE came again, the Manager told them that he had done his duty in 
  distributing the goods where they belonged and they should deal with the smaller

  them what they wanted.</span></font></p>

  understanding of the problem, the prospects for the children are dim indeed. 
  The advocates of the peace process do not want to hear bad news, even from persons

  of common-sense. Any process that advances development and rehabilitation with 
  the people as beneficiaries must also promote democracy and the rule of law. 
  The LTTE&#146;s behaviour since the signing of the MoU does not suggest great 
  respect for either. And Norway has apparently little to contribute in this regard 
  -- not only have the Norwegian monitors not been able to stop child conscription, 
  they have not even been able to protect escapee children from torture (sometimes 
  leading to death) when apprehended or even prevent hostage taking of family

  Placing such a force in charge of rehabilitation would be an invitation for

  wolf in charge of the sheep pen. It is to be expected then that the LTTE will 
  try to ensure that there can be no check on how it spends money. Meanwhile life

  The government forces and the LTTE cover up their own misdeeds, but are careful

  husband is a local English teacher who also owns a mill where dried chillies 
  are ground. Her father <b>Meharajah</b> was a UNP supporter who had married 
  in Padiatalawa, a mixed area in the interior from which the Tamils were expelled 
  in 1958. Mehala's mother's elder sister had married a local Sinhalese businessman, 
  owing to which connection she had relatives in the security forces. One in the 
  STF is said to have visited the Sritharans recently.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>About 
  9.00 PM on 2<sup>nd</sup> October, two men came home on bicycles and asked Sritharan 
  for chilli powder. Sritharan told them through the window that it was not possible 
  as the powder was in the mill. He then opened the door and went out. The two 
  men, who spoke in Tamil, claimed that they were from the LTTE and wanted him 
  to accompany them to Vinayagapuram for an inquiry on a school matter. Sritharan, 
  according to local sources, argued back saying that he would come to the local 
  LTTE office the following morning. He signalled to his wife in English that 
  something was amiss. He then hit one of the men, jumped over the wall and escaped. 
  The men shot at his wife who had come out and got away. Sritharan returned within 
  a few minutes with the front door neighbours to find Mehala in a pool of blood. 
  Mehala who was taken to Thrukkovil Hospital in a tractor-trailer was found dead 
  on admission. </span></font></p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>The 
  bullets found in her body were identified as having come from a T-56. The attackers 
  left behind plaster and a bandage, which were intended to silence the victims. 
  They had also left behind a pair of pliers, a Bata rubber slipper and a bicycle. 
  Initially many were inclined to suspect the LTTE. But certain bits of information 
  that came to light subsequently appeared to point elsewhere. </span></font></p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>The 
  people were uneasy that the STF and Police seem to be blaming the LTTE rather 
  than doing a professional investigation. For example, the basic step of bringing 
  a police dog to pick up the scent from the slipper was not taken. According 
  to local sources, two men who allegedly had STF connections visited a garage 
  close to the Sritharans' and asked questions on the fatal day and the day preceding. 
  The garage owner who keeps his place open until about 11.00 PM had on the fatal 
  day closed at six and gone away. He has reportedly not been available for comment.</span></font></p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>More 
  to the point are claims coming from neighbours that one of the youths who came 
  home that night is Bakery Balan's son, who was close to the STF. Reports in 
  Thirukkovil claim that he left home and is now staying with the STF. The LTTE 
  too has not pressed matters far beyond saying that they are trying to arrest 
  Bakery Balan's son. According to another source, Bakery Balan's son was detained 
  by the LTTE early this year and later released. Such persons normally have multiple

  suddenly under mysterious circumstances. The reports said that she was buried 
  secretly and the family was informed. Further inquiries brought responses that 
  the girl was about 21 and came from the <i>dhoby</i> community. It is also widely 
  spoken that the girl was pregnant and had committed suicide. Getting more details 
  including the girl's name was hard going. The general reaction to casual inquiries 
  was typically, <i>&quot;It is true, but don&#146;t talk about it. It is not

  similarities.</span></font></p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>One 
  said that the girl was pregnant and from the <i>dhoby</i> caste, but was from

  said that the girl, known as Devi or Rani, had finished her training and was 
  in a local office in the Thirukkovil-Thambiluvil area when some members of the 
  public, possibly her relations, were present. At that time her leader Kiruparani 
  (Sida) scolded her over some matter. She was upset and committed suicide later.

  LTTE, all the way from Jaffna to Batticaloa. Those at top-level who have undoubtedly 
  instigated this appear to feel that the MoU forbids the use of guns, but not 
  swords. A sword was used in the LTTE-instigated attack on the EPDP in Delft 
  on 5<sup>th</sup> October. Kodewaran of SEP suffered cut injuries at the hands

<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In Batticaloa town LTTE men have

  the EPDP's local leader, set off from home to the office in Bunting's Lane, 
  not far away. The lights had just come on after a power failure. As he was about 
  to take the turn at the junction of Bunting's and Eeswara Lanes, he noticed 
  several men masking their faces, waiting near a blue van (57-9643) with tinted 
  glasses. Pratheepan accelerated his motor bike and dashed past to his office 
  and returned with help. By then the van and the intruders had vanished. They 
  found in the shadows a sword 3 feet long and a club. Others about the place 
  informed them that the intruders quickly discarded their weapons as soon as 
  the lights came on. One of them was identified as Elil, who heads the LTTE's 
  intelligence wing locally.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>At 
  the same time during the power failure, other LTTE men carrying a long sword

  He too normally returned from the party office about that time. These men too 
  disappeared as soon as the lights came on. Elil of Mahilavedduwan and Sivakumar

  village quarrel. The latter, who had no political involvement, remarked that 
  should he need any intervention he would go to the Police. This was conveyed 
  to Ranjan by LTTE agents who also told him that the youth's brother is in the 
  EPRLF(V). On 12<sup>th</sup> November, Ranjan came in a pick up, thrashed this 
  youth badly and tried to take him to Palugamam in the LTTE-controlled area by 
  road. The STF tuned them back, apparently, as the road is not fully open.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The youth was then taken to Palugamam 
  across the lagoon by boat. There he was thrashed again, cracking his skin in 
  several places. He was told, <i>&quot;The whole world has now come to respect 
  the LTTE, who are you not come when you are called? Had it not been for the 
  cease-fire we would have shot you!&quot;</i> He was then dropped in his village

  over inflicting violence on civilians. The LTTE then went to Kaluwanchikudy 
  Hospital and demanded from the doctor that the patient be discharged to them.

<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>When 
  Jaffna's Additional GA was recently to succeed to the post of Government Agent, 
  he was warned by the LTTE not to accept the appointment as chief administrator 
  in Jaffna. The Government has now appointed the LTTE's choice, Mr. Pathmanthan, 
  a former GA, Jaffna, who was removed in 1998 amidst widespread allegations of 
  corruption. </span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Why was Pathmanthan the LTTE's choice? 
  To answer that we need only look back at the fate of some other Government Agents 
  in the North and East. Mr. Panchalingam, GA, Jaffna, was murdered by the LTTE 
  in 1989 (our <a href="../Reports/Report3/Report3.htm">Report, No 3</a>). Among 
  those killed by the LTTE were Makbool in 1985, a prominent Muslim intellectual 
  from Jaffna and GA, Mannar, and several AGAs. Few months back, the last GA, 
  Batticaloa, left after he was reportedly threatened and slapped by a senior 
  LTTE official. It is not that these victims stood on principle and declined 
  to take instructions from the LTTE. Many had regularly consulted the LTTE's 
  wishes. But they were not prepared to work solely as LTTE functionaries. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Against this record, the reinstatement 
  at the LTTE's behest of the former GA, who was widely regarded as corrupt by 
  the people, is clearly not to further their welfare. The LTTE wants GAs who 
  will carry out its orders without any qualms. The same GA was in charge during 
  the infamous 1995 exodus primarily engineered by the LTTE. Those who felt that 
  the best course for the people was to stay on in Jaffna City, appealed to the 
  GA to release food rations from government stores to churches and other institutions 
  to meet their needs. The GA, Mr. Pathmanathan, who met the delegation, abused 
  and derided them in such terms as <i>'You have got too much fat have you?' (' 
  Ungalukku koluppu metthippochuthu'</i> - roughly meaning <i>'trying to</i> <i>be 
  smart'</i>) for wanting to stay against the LTTE's orders. He told them that 
  they had better leave. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span></span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>Recently, 
  instructions have been given to accommodate the LTTE in administrative meetings 
  of local councils in Jaffna. This appears to be a move to corner elected councillors 
  who may not support the LTTE. Several Jaffna councils had earlier passed resolutions 
  condemning extortion by the LTTE. The inclusion of the LTTE in such meetings, 
  aids the group&#146;s covert take-over of the administration of the North-East 
  to the exclusion of basic accountability. <a href="#_Toc26706405"></a></span></font><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'><a href="#_Toc26706405">[Top]</a></span></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>In 
  all recent cases of attacks by the LTTE on its political opponents, complaints 
  were duly made to the Police, in which the attackers were named. No action has 
  been taken. In the cases of PLOTE councillor Jeyachandran who was attacked by 
  Paapaa in October and of Charles above, the LTTE also stole their motorcycles. 
  The Police have not taken any action. The Police Force has become so debased 
  that it is routinely abused by the party in power, leading to the institutionalisation 
  of widespread corruption. Not surprisingly, this same Force came readymade in 
  turn for use by the LTTE. </span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>The 
  PTA, which guided police behaviour from 1979, made it insensitive to the rule 
  of law and the rights of the citizen. Its even older ethnic bias created humiliation 
  and insecurity for the ordinary Tamil people. Like every arm of the state apparatus, 
  which has atrophied over the years, the Police too could readily be manipulated 
  and used by the LTTE when it enjoys the blessings of the ruling party. The LTTE's 
  investment in terror is now reaping handsome dividends, further boosted by incorporating 
  the state apparatus. </span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>In 
  spite of the general decay in the country, several magistrates in the South 
  do struggle to preserve their independence and lawyers do brave intimidation 
  to represent the interests of clients out of favour with the powers that be. 
  In the North-East, however, there is no semblance of judicial independence when 
  it comes to the LTTE. There is absolutely no prospect of finding a lawyer to 
  represent a victim of the LTTE or to argue against a line it has laid down. 
  It is sheer terror that rules. </span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>There 
  is nothing remarkable in all this. It was all foreseen by those with a common

  the world]. The UNF (UNP), which hoped to reap some elusive economic dividends, 
  was willing to sell the people of the North-East down the river to appease the 
  LTTE and end the war. By trying to run a peace process along these parameters, 
  the Norwegians too proved that they hardly have more scruples. What may perhaps 
  disturb them is the unravelling of their supposed competence as peacemakers. 
  </span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>Those 
  in the North-East who know the truth are compelled to bear the consequences 
  in silence and watch with equanimity. Meanwhile, the Norwegian government lionizes 
  their oppressors and organises press conferences and photo opportunities for 
  Balasingam's equivocations! All this is done in the name of realpolitik. Whether 
  this will be a peace trap for Balasingam, and eventually the LTTE, or the final 
  trap to fix the Tamil people in the Tiger cage and dump them in the Indian Ocean, 
  only time will tell. </span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>Thus 
  after the second round of Thailand talks on 3<sup>rd</sup> November, Balasingham 
  in the company of Minister G.L. Peiris told the world that far from conscripting 
  children, they look after children without proper homes. He further commended 
  their NGO, the Tamil Refugees Organization (TRO), as having plans, among which 
  the rehabilitation of children, for which they hoped to get funds from donors. 
  The TRO was a front organisation supposedly collecting money for refugees at 
  home from expatriates. One could assume that next to nothing of this reached 
  the refugees, given the objective fact that the LTTE was even depriving refugees 
  of government rations. </span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>Even 
  today the state of the people in Vanni under LTTE control has not changed in 
  many crucial respects. The LTTE still controls the distribution of rations and 
  Village Headmen (Grama Sevakas or GSs) prepare inflated lists and carry out 
  the wishes of the LTTE. Along with the LTTE many GSs too are enriching themselves 
  at the expense of the people. Most essential goods are taxed as before. The 
  customs check when entering the LTTE area continues to be more rigorous than 
  at Katunayake International Airport. Items taken for personal use too are carefully 
  taxed. Items such as plastic buckets sent for refugees by the Rehabilitation 
  Ministry are, according to persons living there, simply taken over by the LTTE.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>Anton 
  Balasingam also vowed that they would allow opposition groups to function. By 
  way of qualification he also used the word 'assimilation'. The subtle, but ominous, 
  euphemism was largely lost in the journalistic reporting. For observers familiar 
  the LTTE's past treatment of political opponents and its current attacks on 
  whatever remains of Tamil opposition, 'digesting' them would have been more 
  accurate.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The Norwegians have a lot to answer 
  for as they sit through this deception, applauding the progress of peace and 
  ignoring the LTTE's misdeeds. This is what the Head of the SLMM did with regard 
  to the LTTE and child soldiers, canvassing support for the LTTE. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>The 
  MoU that termed the opposition as Tamil paramilitaries to be disarmed conferred 
  on the LTTE an air of legitimacy - no obligation was placed on them to disavow 
  their past. Why did the SLMM immediately call for a commission of inquiry when 
  two LTTE men were beaten up in Kayts, but chose to remain silent on the LTTE's 
  continuing attacks on the opposition and the disappearance of four persons from 
  the EPRLF (V)? The message coming from Norway is that the Tamil opposition and 
  internal dissent are a nuisance to the kind of peace they want.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>A 
  most controversial aspect of Norway's role is the provision in the MoU giving 
  the LTTE access to government controlled areas for 'political work' with no 
  reciprocity conceded to other political groups. The matter was made worse by 
  the President being kept in the dark on such matters, until after the MoU was 
  signed. Negotiations required no more than a separation of forces. The mischief 
  done is all too evident today. The LTTE's thuggery did not stop with political 
  opponents. The victims included the Hartley College principal and Balasubramania 
  Kurukkal, a Hindu priest who had met the President a year ago.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>Even 
  as Norway was preparing to host a funding session for the LTTE to do rehabilitation 
  work, the LTTE was launching another 'people's protest' to evict the EPDP from 
  Jaffna. This follows a series of threats and attacks since September (see <a href="bul29.htm">Bulletin 
  No.29</a>).<a href="#_Toc26706405">[Top]</a></span></font></p>
<h3><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><a name="_Toc26706425"><b><span
lang=EN-GB>10 Moves to Oust the EPDP from Jaffna</span></b></a></font></h3>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>Following 
  the LTTE-instigated attack on the EPDP in Delft Island on 5<sup>th</sup> October, 
  the handful of EPDP men left when the SLMM too was unable to give guarantees 
  for their security. It became an issue in the South and President Kumaratunga 
  called for a police report on the matter. She may also have her political reasons 
  for it, while the Government too may be worried about such precedents becoming 
  the pattern. An enhanced contingent of the EPDP of about 40 men returned to 
  Delft under navy escort on 17<sup>th</sup> November. The police presence too 
  had been strengthened. Despite LTTE attempts to bring outsiders and instigate 
  a riot to dislodge them, they stayed on. According to an EPDP statement, the 
  SLMM suggested that the EPDP pull out and sort out the matter through negotiation. 
  It added that they (the EPDP) expressed willingness to do so provided the LTTE 
  too pulled out, to which the SLMM threatened to report them to the European 
  Union!</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In the night of Wednesday 20<sup>th</sup> 
  November, two firebombs were thrown at the EPDP office in Chavakacheri. On the 
  21<sup>st</sup> LTTE agents, not with great success, collected people on the 
  roads and school children to demonstrate at the EPDP's Sridhar Theatre office 
  in Jaffna, calling upon the EPDP to get out. Earlier, NGOs under the LTTE's 
  umbrella gave the SLMM a petition calling for the removal of the EPDP. The demonstration 
  was addressed by Gajendran, former LTTE-sponsored Jaffna University student 
  leader. When the LTTE was given entry to Jaffna in April, Gajendran in a welcome 
  speech at the Nallur Temple threatened the Army that if they did not leave Jaffna, 
  they would finish up fertilising its soil. His whole speech at the demonstration 
  was essentially<i>, 'EPDP dogs get out'</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b><span></span>Ilamparithy</b> 
  (formally <b>Aanjaneyar</b>, <b>LTTE's poltical leader in Jaffna</b>), told 
  the media that the 'people' wanted the EPDP to leave. It was he who ordered 
  the attack on the Hartley College principal. Also joining the cry for the removal 
  of the EPDP from Delft are the TULF, its TNA partners, and the UNP member for 
  Jaffna. Among them, there is intense competition to win the LTTE's favour to 
  ensure their continuance in Parliament. According to sources in Jaffna, the 
  UNP member, who was openly using his thugs to attack and humiliate EPDP supporters 
  at the last elections, has vowed to get the EPDP out of Delft. It is known in 
  Jaffna that this UNP member 'Kerosene' Maheswaran's line to the LTTE is, <i>&quot;You 
  cannot trust the TULF (except for my business partner Ravi) or the TNA, you 
  cannot trust Prime Minister Wickremasinghe, but I remain, your humble and obedient 
  servant.&quot;</i></font><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">

  to the Duraiappah Days</span></b></a></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>Now 
  that Balasingam had stated plainly in the famous Sakthy TV interview that the 
  TNA are their (the LTTE's) minions, there is nothing surprising in the TNA MPs 
  having withheld their support for the Government's Interior Ministry vote, demanding 
  that it close down the EPDP's Delft office. Their campaign marks a low ebb in 
  Tamil politics, revealing the ugly wreckage strewn among the shingles.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>The 
  TULF's charges about the EPDP's anti-democratic practices in the Islands, which 
  it controlled for ten years, are largely true. Its (the TULF's) dishonest intentions 
  are however evident in what it does not say. During the same period the LTTE 
  killed thousands of Tamils, whom it branded traitors, in its prisons, including 
  elderly TULF supporters. Since the Army retook Jaffna in 1996 the LTTE has killed 
  scores of ordinary civilians in the peninsula including at least 5 leading TULF 
  figures. This was violence that is ideological and institutional. It is both 
  in quantity and quality vastly different from anything the EPDP can be credited 
  with. </span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The TULF/TNA would have been on 
  very legitimate grounds had they demanded police protection to set up an office 
  in Delft and challenge the EPDP. Their demand is that the Government should 
  pull out the EPDP and surrender the people to the LTTE's draconian regime, as 
  the TULF have done their souls. In their barrage against the EPDP, the TULF 
  have forgotten to mention that the LTTE is not only present in the Delft, but 
  is the sole cause of the current violence. They hardly mentioned one incident 
  of misdemeanour by the EPDP in the last ten months. They have invariably been 
  the victims.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>Indeed, 
  the TULF is deliberately engaging in doublespeak. The TULF leader has remained 
  silent. Several senior TULFers outwardly crusading against the EPDP have been 
  sending private messages to reassure them, even as Maheswaran is reportedly 
  pressing the LTTE to order them into the bull ring. They have no doubt that 
  should the LTTE succeed in throwing the EPDP and other opposition groups out 
  of the North-East, they would be next.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>The 
  TULF know that they, and not the EPDP, are the authors, not only of ideologically 
  directed political violence, but also of the abysmal level of political discourse 
  in Tamil society. Their purely opportunistic tirade against Alfred Duraiappah 
  as a traitor, instigated his murder and the birth of the LTTE, which in turn 
  made them traitors. To quote Izeth Hussain, <i>&quot;&#133;the Vellalah Tamil 
  political elites who started off by trying to carve out an exclusive political 
  borough for themselves, have ended up as the retainers of the 'boys' (and girls) 
  they thought they could deploy for their elititarian ends. They have, in a final 
  admission of their historical obsolescence, nominated the LTTE as the sole representative 
  of the Tamil-speaking people&quot;(The Island 8<sup>th</sup>&amp;11<sup>th</sup> 
  Nov.02).</i></span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>Having 
  brought the community into this hopeless morass, what did the TULF do to get 
  them out? They went under the LTTE's umbrella in time for last December's elections 
  and hid their nakedness by going back to the great days of Duraiappah bashing! 
  This time their target was the EPDP who were roundly abused as traitors and 
  worse. When the TULF holds up the EPDP's fatal attack on the TNA election procession 
  in Velanai as an instance of its villainy, it is well to remember that there 
  was no virtue on its side. When young LTTE spokesmen like Gajendran use abusive 
  language that will shame any society, one must remember that they learnt it 
  from their TULF peers. Were the EPDP the hated and contemptible nonentity the 
  TULF and LTTE claim it is, why do they waste such inordinate effort worrying 
  about a small disarmed group? Last December's election results give us the answer.<a href="#_Toc26706405">[Top]</a></span></font></p>
<h3><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><a name="_Toc26706427"><b><span
lang=EN-GB>12 Some Home Truths on Sole Representation</span></b></a></font></h3>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>The 
  Tamil opposition in the North-East faced a very unequal contest at the December 
  2001 parliamentary elections. The LTTE's terror supported fully the campaign 
  of the TULF/TNA. The Tamil media had almost become LTTE propaganda sheets - 
  a process now completed under the MoU. Organised vote rigging using the huge 
  non-resident vote was overwhelmingly in favour of the TNA (see <a href="bul28.htm">Bulletin 
  No. 28</a>). Even so the TULF/TNA, which deputised the LTTE, obtained votes 
  accounting for only 34% of the voters resident in the Jaffna District.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>The 
  TULF/TNA's percentage of the valid votes in Jaffna was 55% as against the EPDP's 
  31%. Given that the TULF was in a four-party alliance, its share of the 55% 
  would have left it with a standing hardly better than the EPDP's. Several senior 
  TULFers admitted privately that the bulk of the EPDP's votes were genuine, polled 
  in areas outside Jaffna town and the Islands where it had very little prospect 
  of electoral abuse. Whichever way one looks at it, it was a big come down for 
  the brand of politics advanced by the LTTE/TULF/TNA.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">It may be recalled that at the peak 
  of the nationalist wave in 1977 - the year of the last free and fair elections 
  in Jaffna - the TULF polled more than 70% with a very high turnout. The message 
  in 2001 was one of disillusionment. In spite of an atmosphere of intimidation, 
  many voted for the EPDP purely in search of an alternative. People, who are 
  wary of the EPDP's opportunism and lack of principles, still voted for them 
  to signal their fear of an LTTE dispensation. That is why the LTTE and TULF 
  hate the EPDP. It has been instrumental in exposing them. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>The 
  more bluster there is from the LTTE lobby about a people's struggle to evict 
  the EPDP from Jaffna, less convincing are the facts on the ground. The 'huge 
  protests' largely remain a creation of the Tamil media. The recent demonstration 
  at the EPDP's Jaffna office, where Gajendran poured abuse, collected a crowd 
  of less than 150, of whom about 40 were university students. Last December Gajendran 
  had mobilised a large number of university students for election malpractice. 
  Fewer and fewer students have been attending LTTE functions.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>The 
  louder Balasingam and his cohorts wax about the supremacy of the LTTE and its 
  leader, the more eloquent is the rejection in real life. Recently, the Colombo 
  High Court slapped a 200-year prison sentence on the man Balasingam declared 
  both the President and Prime Minister of Tamil Eelam. The sentence is not without 
  problems, given that several leaders in the South guilty of mass murder were 
  never tried in Court. When the LTTE organised protests, one might have expected 
  a huge show of indignation by the Tamil people with hundreds of thousands demonstrating 
  on the streets. What resulted was a massive show of indifference.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>In 
  spite of the LTTE's efforts, only about 3000 participated in Jaffna on 8<sup>th</sup> 
  November. Merely stating that number does not however do justice to an event 
  that was notoriously a damp squib. The procession was due to leave the Hindu 
  Temple at the Jaffna University at 9.00 AM, but there was hardly a quorum. The 
  University's Dean of Arts had been asked to lead the procession and he had little 
  choice. When the procession did not take off, he told the organisers to call 
  him from his office when they are ready. Nothing happened for a long time. Finally, 
  the Dean was called at 11.00 AM! </span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The LTTE had desperately gone around 
  making loudspeaker announcements, pleading with, cajoling and forcing people 
  to come. The Co-ops were ordered to release vehicles. At Kalviyankadu, a vehicle 
  was brought and people were called, but hardly anyone responded. The modest 
  number was finally made up by bringing school children from rural areas and 
  teachers from a training college. The <i>Daily News</i> of 9<sup>th</sup> November 
  reported a <i>'three mile long procession'</i> comprising students, teachers, 
  representatives of NGOs, members of the fishermen's society, priests and members 
  of the public. The 'three mile long' actually refers to the distance walked! 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>This 
  is the general pattern. The LTTE was angry after the demonstration organised 
  for the same purpose in Batticaloa a few days earlier brought only about 200 
  people. The presence of the SLMM has also limited the LTTE's ability to force 
  people. What is happening today is a far cry from the crowds turning up spontaneously 
  for public occasions and protests down to the mid-1980s. Today's reality is 
  that the LTTE has turned the Tamil Nation into an ass and an ass can be terribly 
  stubborn. Once used, the full force of excruciating blows will fail to move 
  it.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>Against 
  this reality, Balasingam's patronising offer to 'assimilate' other Tamil groups 
  is a pathetic attempt at distorting reality. They appear credible only in the 
  light of the Government and Norway misguidedly rewarding terror at the expense 
  of the people.<a href="#_Toc26706405">[Top]</a></span></font></p>

lang=EN-GB>14 The Multiple Shafts of Terror</span></b></a></font></h3>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>The 
  LTTE's actions clearly reveal that it is very unhappy with the extent of defiance 
  that still resides in a terrorised society. It will continue to target individuals 
  suspected of independence in every sector of society. Early in November, the 
  LTTE beat up Balasubramania Kurukkal who officiates near the Primary Section 
  of Jaffna Hindu College. He was among delegates from the Association of Hindu 
  Clergy whom the EPDP had arranged to meet the President a year ago. A clear 
  pointer to the future is the manner in which the LTTE has targetted the educational 
  sector. <a href="#_Toc26706405">[Top]</a></span></font></p>

  of Hartley</span></b></a></font></h3>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>From 
  the day after the LTTE entered Jaffna, they had been making a beeline for schools. 
  Hartley's troubles began early when the Army refused the LTTE admission to the 
  Hartley College and Methodist Girls' School since they are in a high security 
  zone. The LTTE resorted to 'people's protests', leading to the unruly one on 
  2<sup>nd</sup> September when the Army had to fire into the air to restore order.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>The 
  LTTE's immediate displeasure against the Hartley Principal Mr.Sripathy was based 
  on three matters. After the 2<sup>nd</sup> September incident, he announced 
  at the school assembly that anyone intending to go for a demonstration should 
  not come to school, but must proceed directly from home. Anyone coming to school 
  should not leave the premises until 2.30 PM. Later, speaking at a meeting between 
  leading principals and the army command at Subhas Hotel, he explained the nature 
  of MoU, which provides for settling disputes between the LTTE and the Security 
  Forces through the SLMM. He added that there is no call on anyone to use students 
  and civilians in settling disputes. He further commended the Army's restraint 
  during the protest in spite of the provocation. The demonstrators, among whom 
  contrary to media claims there were very few students, had damaged personal 
  items of security personnel and contaminated their food items, sometimes in 
  vulgar fashion. Mr. Sripathy told the meeting that in the particular incident 
  the Army had behaved like <i>Bodhi Sattvas</i>.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>On 
  19<sup>th</sup> September, the LTTE's political head Ilamparithy (Aanjaneyar) 
  summoned the school principals of Vadamaratchy, nearly 70 of them, for a meeting 
  at the regional DE's office at Manthikai. According to teaching circles in Jaffna, 
  speaking of 'some principals' without naming anyone, Ilamparithy listed the 
  putative offences of the Hartley Principal. He then closed his eyes, after his 
  peculiar mannerism when saying something dramatic and continued: <i>&quot;When 
  rice shoots appear in the field they are indistinguishable from weeds. In time 
  the weeds put forth flowers when they are clearly identifiable. Then comes the 
  time to pluck them out.&quot; </i>Ilamparithy reminded the principals not to 
  have illusions that the MoU would deter them from taking action against undesirable 
  persons. </span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>Two 
  days after Ilamparithy's homily, about 15 goons attacked the principal at home 
  in the night (see <a href="../SpecialReports/spreport15.htm">Special Report 
  No. 15</a>). Some of the attackers have been identified as persons set up by 
  the local LTTE leader Nishantan, who also commandeered a local minibus. The 
  two or so who led the attack are believed to be Illaparity's men from his home 
  area of Meesalai, Thenmaratchy. Since then, the Central College Principal has 
  come under pressure from 'student protests' to remove him. Teaching sources 
  also said that above 90% of the principals and 80% of the teachers are solidly 
  hostile to the LTTE's activities. But the LTTE is aiming for a clear field in 
  the schools by using selective terror. Ilamparithy made that clear. Once this 
  regime is firmly rooted, conscription of children in its blatantly crude forms 
  will become unnecessary (see for example <a href="bul23.htm">Bulletin No 23 
  </a>on the Vanni).<a href="#_Toc26706405">[Top]</a></span></font></p>
<h3><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><a name="_Toc26706430"><b><span
lang=EN-GB>14.2 The Tamil Eelam Prison Service</span></b></a></font></h3>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>When 
  LTTE spokesmen vaunt their claims to statehood, they list their possession of 
  an army, navy, police, courts and an administration. With good reason they fail 
  to mention their pioneering achievement towards statehood - the notorious complex 
  of prisons built in 1990 with Premadasa's largesse (see <a href="../Reports/Report9/Report9.htm">Reports 
  9</a> &amp; <a href="../Reports/Report10/Report10.htm">10</a>). Of the thousands 
  held, the majority was killed. There has been no notable Tamil dissident activity 
  since then. However, given the nature of the LTTE and its paranoia, secret prisons 
  are integral to its outlook. Recently there have been revelations about the 
  new prison complex. This does not appear to be the prison to which those sentenced 
  in LTTE courts are sent. Nor it is the prison seen by Amnesty International 
  delegates last June, after which they made some observations which they thought 
  were well received.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>The 
  prison complex we refer to is located in dense jungle in the Vanni bordered 
  by Muthiyankaddu, Viswamadu and Udayarkaddu, north-east of Mankulam. As with 
  several secret LTTE institutions in the same area, the ground has been cleared 
  of shrubs, but the cover of large trees shuts out any view from the air above. 
  A wall topped with barbed wire surrounds the complex that is several acres in 
  extent. The complex is divided into sections isolated from one another.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>One 
  category of inmates comprises traders travelling between LTTE and government-controlled 
  areas suspected of passing information to the Army. A number of civilians accused 
  of being friendly with the Army in areas retaken by the LTTE were also held 
  in this complex. Most of them, we understand, were released. Unlike in 1990, 
  the system is more professional. Food is no longer atrocious, at least for the 
  softer categories who have been allowed to prepare their own meals. It is difficult 
  to ascertain if there are some long-term political prisoners being held over 
  for special reasons.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Prisoners who have compared notes, 
  estimate that about 700 prisoners inhabit that complex. There is no indication 
  that any Sri Lankan security personnel are held there. Witnesses who served 
  in the LTTE's Border Force said that a large number of soldiers surrendered 
  to the LTTE when it captured Elephant Pass and were led away. These sources 
  however believe that the soldiers were all killed. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>The 
  indications are that this complex is presently operating off-season, as it were, 
  at far below its full capacity. It has been built more in anticipation of future 
  rather than present needs. It would realise its full potential when the hand-over 
  of the North-East to the LTTE is complete.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>The 
  kinds of persons and groups already under attack by the LTTE give an idea of 
  the prospective inmates of the complex. The LTTE has already abducted an unspecified 
  number of persons from government-controlled areas, in complete violation of 
  the MoU. Our recent reports have listed a few abducted members of opposition 
  parties. There is another category of missing persons with no political affiliations 
  who would be difficult to quantify.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>Under 
  the conditions of the MoU, a Sea Tiger visited his family in Point Pedro. He 
  then took a commercial flight to Colombo, and is believed to have gone abroad. 
  The LTTE arrested his father and took him to the Vanni through the army checkpoint 
  at Muhamalai on the pillion of a motor cycle. This father is known popularly 
  as <b>Sothy</b>, a former employee of Sri Murugan Pharmacy and resident of Nagalingan 
  Mudaliyar Lane, Pt. Pedro. He would not have been produced in any LTTE court. 
  His problem is now very common and how many there are like him, we cannot tell. 
  There is no question of ICRC or SLMM access to such detainees whom the LTTE 
  will never admit holding.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>While 
  the LTTE is urging various groups, and rightly, to have the Government repeal 
  the PTA, it continues to hold its own detainees incommunicado in complete travesty 
  of International Law. This duplicity is made worse by indications that it is 
  planning for more. The need for these repressive structures gives us an idea 
  of the kind of social order now mushrooming under the guise of peace.<a href="#_Toc26706405">[Top]</a></span></font></p>
<h3><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><a name="_Toc26706431"><b><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>15 The Vanishing of the Middle Ground and 
  Danger Signals in the South</span></b></a></font></h3>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>The 
  Government's peace strategy is to hand over the North-East unofficially and 
  use economic incentives, along with the US as a scarecrow, to control or undermine 
  the LTTE. The LTTE has been constrained or slowed down in some respects, such 
  as by having to tolerate the SLMM, but has continued to make decisive gains 
  towards its objective of establishing fascist control. The Government and Norway 
  pretend that all is well while the South is increasingly skeptical.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>The 
  biggest losers in this game are the Tamil people. Their fate is being decided, 
  as it were, in a cattle market. But this is not how it is seen in the South. 
  Many Sinhalese who wished for a just political settlement have been overwhelmed 
  by disbelief at how the present government is going about it. This has resulted 
  in a number of sober people losing their balance. In their present articulations 
  they can be mistaken for those who argue that the Tamils have no problems, and 
  are indeed privileged. There is a definite nuance that only the rights of the 
  Sinhalese and Muslims are being jeopardised. The scandal of child conscription 
  becomes a weapon against the LTTE in the propaganda game, rather one that bespeaks 
  the enormous tragedy and destruction suffered by a community condemned to silence.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>Statements 
  from the PA opposition and the President too have tended in this direction and 
  are aimed at cornering the Government rather than helping to solve the problem. 
  In this climate the Tamils are being closely identified with the LTTE, who, 
  as it were, not only have a surfeit of rights, but are 'getting their Eelam' 
  at everyone else's expense. The other camp in the South - the peace activists 
  - do not discuss the rights and wrongs of the Tamil problem, but largely identify 
  peace with appeasing the LTTE.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>Consequently, 
  the middle ground in the South has disappeared. There is little acknowledgement 
  that the Tamils were, over many years, victims of violence that enjoyed state 
  complicity. Newspaper articles are frequently recounting instances of violence 
  against Sinhalese and Muslims by the Tigers, while pretending that its counterpart 
  - the many times more severe and far more culpable attacks on Tamil civilians 
  by the State - did not exist. The recent controversial court verdict acquitted 
  those charged over the Army's Mahilantanai massacre - a gruesome affair largely 
  involving elders and children. The lack of comment shows that most people know 
  the truth. It will stop there.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>There 
  is hardly any section in the South trying to find out independently the facts 
  after an incident involving the security forces and Tamil civilians. The recent 
  incidents in Kanjirankudah and Trincomalee (see our <a href="bul29.htm">Bulletin 
  No.29</a>) are more remarkable for the fact that truth can suffer such singular 
  distortion during a peace process. In Trincomalee the policemen responsible 
  for the deaths and injuries appear to be getting away scot-free. In Kanjirankudah, 
  both the Gunatilleke Commission and the Magistrate appear to have skipped the 
  awkward questions arising out of the STF's several versions. Only Tamils are 
  complaining.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>These 
  developments have left even very moderate Tamils feeling disturbed and helpless. 
  Tamil civilians have been reduced to the state of 'scavengers' (<i>'porukki'</i>) 
  for the LTTE to fashion their disenchantment into human dynamite. If this is 
  the kind of justice the Tamils receive during a peace process, what hope is 
  there for them if war resumes? The country moves deeper into crisis against 
  the growing smug and self-serving presumption in the South that Tamils are invariably 
  liars. The whole system works that way. Take for example the repulsive manner 
  in which officialdom, from the President downward, handled the 1995 bombing 
  of refugees at the Navaly Church.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>Civil 
  society in the South has singularly failed to exercise a corrective influence 
  on the peace process by lobbying on issues that have long concerned Tamil civilians. 
  Among these are institutional changes to ensure that the security forces become 
  sensitive to the fact that they are also meant to serve and protect Tamils. 
  Little has been done to enhance the dignity and security of Tamils and, in the 
  event of war, it will be back to square one. The peace process has been left 
  hostage to the whims of the Tigers and the elusive restraints the International 
  Community might apply on them.<a href="#_Toc26706405">[Top]</a></span></font></p>
<h3><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><a name="_Toc26706432"><b><span
lang=EN-GB>16 No Peace Without Democracy</span></b></a></font></h3>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>While 
  there can be no peace without restoring to the Tamil people a sense of dignity, 
  it has been our contention that the main source of the loss of dignity is fascist 
  politics, rather than minority status. Take an important aspect. The two sides, 
  on their own admission, have each lost nearly 20,000 fighters. The LTTE's recruitment 
  base has a population of hardly more than a million, while for the Government 
  it is over 15 million. Yet, it is only in the South that the losses have made 
  a notable public impact and the Army has to contend with a paucity of recruits 
  and huge desertions. Consequently, governments in Colombo have faced considerable 
  pressure to end the war.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>However, 
  even as Tamil society was driven to desperate straits by these highly disproportionate 
  losses, the LTTE has easily been able to override the people's desire for peace. 
  It had so narrowed its options by the weight of its bloodstained history that 
  it could not allow itself to be deterred by mass emigration, a debilitating 
  form of protest. In its self-justifying logic of destruction, conscription of 
  children, underpinned by internal terror, was rationalised as a necessary step 
  to preserve its 'gains'.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>It 
  is not that Tamil society accepts this enforced devastation willingly, rather, 
  it has been denied any meaningful democratic expression. In the South, corruption 
  in the Defence Establishment, the incompetence of generals and the non-viability 
  of government policy are issues that are debated in public and ultimately influence 
  decisions of state.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>The 
  supposed successes and military prowess of LTTE generals are myths that are 
  seldom seen for what they really are. It is not a success for a guerrilla army 
  from a small minority to have sacrificed an equal number of fighters in confronting 
  the state army. Rather, it represents megalomania and callousness in the profligate 
  disposal of lives. All that is tragically remarkable is the level of destructiveness 
  that could be achieved through repression that methodically exploits all the 
  foibles of a society.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>The 
  slogan coming from the peace lobby that the task of peace is 'to transform the 
  LTTE from a military to a political organisation' is fine so far as it goes. 
  But one could hardly achieve this objective by being wilfully blind to the essential 
  institutional nature of the LTTE and how ideology, glorification of suicide, 
  repression and child soldiers hang together inseparably.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>International 
  agencies and embassies function in such a way that they tend to avoid deeper 
  political ramifications and define their tasks to attain narrow objectives. 
  In a recent AFP report (<i>Mirror </i>23.11.02) for example, the local UNICEF 
  head defined their task with regard to child soldiers as not getting into a 
  debate on why there are child soldiers, but getting them out. Formulated in 
  this way, every token release of children by the LTTE becomes a success story. 
  Every agency has no doubt found the LTTE flexible and has a success story to 
  report. Herein lies the danger, while all these success stories taken together 
  are inevitably interpreted as real progress, the reality may be quite the opposite. 
  Moreover, such progress may have no bearing on long term prospects.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>Unless 
  there is change at the LTTE's political core, its reliance on terror, war and, 
  of necessity, child soldiers, will not change. Everyone likes to report progress. 
  But mistaken assessments frequently lead to decisions encouraging irreversibly 
  dangerous trends.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>The 
  Norwegians see their success as a matter of maintaining the cease-fire and have 
  made regular claims of progress. This 'progress' has served as a pretext for 
  the LTTE to entrench its apparatus of terror in the government-controlled areas. 
  The SLMM's inability to do anything decisive has done little to induce the Norwegians 
  to greater caution. We pointed out that once the grip of terror is complete, 
  the LTTE would have many covert options to induce children to bear arms.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>If 
  one were getting about the task of peace, conscious of the malignant phenomenon 
  one is faced with, one would have been careful to enhance rather than throw 
  away assets that are essential for peace. Even in a state of debilitation, the 
  residual right to organise politically, to speak out, elect representatives 
  and for schools and offices to function normally are invaluable assets. Anyone 
  who values democracy knows that to deny political parties the right to function 
  independently and disseminate opinion, raises concerns going way beyond the 
  interests of party members. Such a denial strikes at the heart of basic rights, 
  security and dignity of the ordinary individual. This is why defending the EPDP's 
  right to run a political office in Delft has become a make or break issue for 
  the Tamil people.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>What 
  is at stake is reflected nowhere more eloquently than in the strained language 
  and bizarre reasoning of the statement on the Delft imbroglio attributed jointly 
  to the Bishops of Jaffna and Mannar. The statement of 25<sup>th</sup> November 
  clearly pointed to the LTTE as the true representatives of the people. In this 
  context, the EPDP was by clear allusion identified as the party, which for its 
  selfish ends was disregarding the sensibilities of the people. It was further 
  accused of jeopardising the peace process and driving the people into the trap 
  of chauvinists from the majority. In a disingenuous attempt to be correct, it 
  acknowledged ritually the right of any political party to campaign for its programme.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The statement began thus: <i>&quot;While 
  peace blossoms in the country, while in the month of November the Christians 
  remember their dead; and while at this time all the Tamil people celebrate those 
  who gave their life for the liberation of their soil&#133;&quot; </i>The statement 
  places All Saints Day in the Christian calendar which falls on 1<sup>st</sup> 
  November on the same footing as the LTTE Martyrs' Week. The latter, observed 
  from 21<sup>st</sup> to 27<sup>th</sup> November, includes the Leader's birthday. 
  It has dark ideological connotations. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>All 
  those who died from other militant groups and the LTTE's numerous victims are 
  dismissed as traitors and vermin. Child soldiers and distraught victims of this 
  dispensation who committed suicide at the Leader's behest for his dream state, 
  are during this week commemorated as martyrs. When church leaders who are themselves 
  confused lend legitimacy to a diabolical political force, the community as a 
  whole faces a bleak future.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>Even 
  under the Nazi regime one would be hard put to identify one Christian leader 
  who went so far to deify the Nazis and their works. We find it hard to believe 
  that this statement originated from the two Bishops who were showing signs of 
  being balanced and even handed. It is more likely that they were under intense 
  pressure to sign the statement drafted by someone else. It has appeared only 
  in Tamil. </span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>Why 
  should the EPDP be singled out and denied its normal rights, while it is the 
  LTTE that is acting with open contempt for the MoU it signed. The Bishops have 
  failed to mention that there is already a concerted violent campaign by the 
  LTTE to evict the EPDP from the entire Jaffna District. The attack on EPDP members 
  is part of an indivisible phenomenon that includes the violent hounding of independent 
  school principals and the conscription of children.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'>The 
  statement of the Bishops can also be seen as a further unfolding of the logic 
  of the present peace process: <i>&quot;Forget about human rights, forget about 
  International Law that the MoU enshrines, all that matters is the cease-fire 
  must hold. If you disagree with the LTTE or do not like their ways, get out 
  unless you want to go down!&quot;</i> If that were to be the end result, the 
  peace process might have been concluded swiftly without putting us through an 
  MoU and months of fuss and ceremony. The only sure means to peace is to give 
  the Tamil community the democratic strength to resist the imposition of war.<a href="#_Toc26706405">[</a></span></font><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;'><a href="#_Toc26706405">Top]</a></span></font></p>
