  REALITY<u1:p></u1:p></span></a></h3>
<p><u1:p></u1:p>The incident which marred the observance of Sri Lanka&#146;s fifty 
  years of independence was of a kind far less frequent today, although not unusual 
  in the course of the ongoing war. Although the tragedy took place three days 
  earlier, it was blacked out to such an extent that the bulk of the people did 
  not know about it as they observed independence day on 4<sup>th</sup> February. 
  The last major massacre of Tamil civilians by the security forces in the Trincomalee 
  District took place two years ago during February 1996 in Kumarapuram, Kiliveddy. 
  Although testimony of complicity by the battalion commander was received by 
  the late MP, A. Thangathurai, it is some low ranking soldiers who are facing 
  charges in the unconcluded trial. The cold blooded murder of 5 detainees at 
  the Customs Road prison on 30<sup>th</sup> October 1996 in the heart of Trincomalee 
  town, after some hard - core LTTE detainees made their escape, was totally covered 
  up. Other isolated incidents from time to time have also gone uninvestigated. 
  Thus the present incident must also be seen in the general context of prevailing 
  impunity. [See our <a href="bul10.htm">bulletin No. 10</a> of February 1996 
  and <a href="..\SpecialReports\spreport8.htm">Special Report No. 8</a> of March 
  1997.]<u1:p></u1:p></p>
<p><u1:p></u1:p>The core facts of the present incident are not hard to ascertain 
  and have been covered in the Tamil press (eg. Virakesari) in the last two days. 
  In summary (see below for a more complete account) policemen in three camps 
  near the Tamil villages of Puthukkudiyiruppu and Potkerni spent the night of 
  Saturday 31<sup>st</sup> January in a drinking orgy and fired mostly into the 
  air throughout the night. Although inebriated in the morning (1<sup>st</sup> 
  February), apparently in a bid to cover up the misdemeanour, the police cooked 
  up the story of an LTTE attack and launched a round up in the morning with 
  the help of home guards from Sinhapura and Jayapura - two neighbouring Sinhalese 
  settlements established by the late Brigadier Lucky Wijerratne soon after the 
  re-commencement of war in June 1990. [This Aspect will be central to what follows.] 
  This round up amounted to beating up civilians with unrestrained violence, at 
  the end of which 8 civilians aged 14 upwards were taken to the police station 
  and murdered in a brutal manner. The action was totally unprovoked.<u1:p></u1:p></p>
<p><span> </span> <u1:p></u1:p></p>
<p>Early official reports broadcast(and not subsequently corrected) were to the 
  effect that there had been an LTTE attack in the area and that those killed 
  were LTTE cadre. Well placed sources in Trincomalee town assured us that there 
  was no attempt at a cover up and in fact leading security officials in Trincomalee 
  believed initially the police version from Thampalakamam. The next morning 
  (2<sup>nd</sup>) Nihal Karunaratne, SSP Kantalai, Sanath Nannayakara, SP Kantalai 
  and Thampalakamam Divisional Secretary M.P. Wijesooriya visited the villages. 
  Nihal Karunaratne, is said to have given an assurance that a full investigation 
  is being made by 3 independent police teams. When contacted by us today (4<sup>th</sup> 
  February), Mr. M. Sivasithamparam, President, TULF, said that Brigadier Nihal 
  Jayakody who is in charge at Trincomalee, had sounded firm on the law taking 
  its course. Asked if he was satisfied, Mr. Sivasithamparam replied that &#145;we 
  will have to wait and see&#146;. Asked for the president&#146;s response, he 
  said that she had not so far responded to his missive. Judicial circles in Trincomalee 
  saw no impediment at present to a fair hearing . In the villages themselves 
  a fear of reprisals remains.<u1:p></u1:p></p>
<p><u1:p></u1:p>The funerals on the morning of 4<sup>th</sup> February were attended 
  by SSP and SP, Kantalai, who gave further assurances to the villagers. Our 
  purpose in presenting this report is not so much to present the facts of the 
  case as to address the deeper underlying problem that may be lost in the course 
  of concentrating on criminal culpability.<u1:p><span lang=EN-GB style='letter-spacing:-.15pt;

<h3><a name="_Toc515618778"><span lang=EN-GB><u1:p></u1:p>New Power Relations<u1:p></u1:p></span></a></h3>
<p><u1:p></u1:p>These are to do with the present ethnic conflict and the transformation 
  of power relations resulting from state aided Sinhalese colonisation in parts 
  of the North - East. This is particularly acute in the Trincomalee District. 
  [See our <a
href="..\Reports\Report11\Report11.htm">Reports 11</a> &amp; <a
href="..\Reports\Report12\Report12.htm">12</a> of 1993 in addition to the earlier 
  documents cited.] We had stated forcefully that this problem needs to be addressed 
  justly and courageously. Even the present government which has gone a long 
  way to present the outlines of a political solution has so far failed to take 
  even token steps in addressing the problem even in such an outrageous instance 
  as Weli Oya [our <a href="..\SpecialReports\spreport5.htm">Special Repot No. 
  5</a> of 1993 &amp; <a href="bul5.htm">Bulletin No. 5</a> of January 1995]. 
  Unless this problem is addressed urgently, a political settlement that brings 
  peace can hardly become a reality.<u1:p></u1:p></p>
<p><u1:p></u1:p>The problem of colonisation was raised by Tamil leaders nearly 
  50 years ago, in the wake of independence. Thampalakamam is yet another classic 
  instance of some of the worst fears coming true:- viz. State sponsored colonisation 
  of Sinhalese --&gt; administrative aggression and communal violence against 
  minority communities --&gt; marginalisation and eviction of minorities. We 
  have also tried to point out the large extent to which this experience, both 
  actual and anticipated, has contributed to the ongoing conflict. Kantalai which 
  lies upstream of Thampalakamam became largely Sinhalese through state sponsored 
  colonisation in the 50s. About 30 Tamils were killed during the 1977 communal 
  violence which resulted in several of the better off Tamils leaving the area. 
  Thampalakamam is now going through that process. People who for generations 
  had regarded Thampalakamam as their home, suddenly find themselves powerless 
  in a hostile environment with all forces ranged against them.<u1:p></u1:p></p>
<p><u1:p></u1:p>To illustrate the undercurrents resulting from the combined atrocity 
  of the police and Sinhalese home guards from the new settlement , the older 
  folk want the police replaced by the army. In contrast a dozen of youths asked 
  a social worker, &#145;<b>Rather than stay at home and get killed, should we 
  not join the Tigers and at least die fighting?&#146;. The social worker admitted 
  that he was at a loss.<u1:p><span lang=EN-GB style='letter-spacing:-.15pt;
'><a href="#_Toc515618776">[Top]</a></span></u1:p></b></p>
<p><b><span lang=EN-GB><u1:p></u1:p>Post June 1990<u1:p></u1:p></span></b></p>
<p><u1:p></u1:p>Further to earlier steps taken under the Jayewardene regime to 
  demographically transform Trincomalee District from the late 70s, decisive 
  but short-sighted steps to transform the chararactor of Thampalakamam were 
  taken soon after June 1990. This was when the LTTE broke off its marriage of 
  convenience with the Premadasa regime and resumed hostilities. Brigadier Lucky 
  Wijeratne settled Sinhalese encroachers, along the Thampalakamam - Trincomalee 
  Road [see note below] many of whom were displaced from around the place during 
  the Indian Army&#146;s presence. Near Thampalakamam Jayapura was established 
  to the east of the road (125 allotments of 20 perches) and Sinhapura to the 
  west of the road ( 75 allotments of 20 perches) on 10 acres of teak forest reserve 
  that was cleared for that purpose. The Brigadier also prevailed upon an NGO 
  to build several houses for them with the rehabilitation ministry providing 
  part of the funds.<u1:p></u1:p></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB>In the meantime most Tamil civilians fled the area upon the 
  LTTE&#146;s withdrawal after provoking the army&#146;s wrath through the killing 
  of hundreds of servicemen who surrendered. For the first time under the cover 
  of hostilities, Thampalakamam began to be treated as a Sinhalese AGA ( now DS) 
  division, with the appointment of a Sinhalese as AGA(now DS) . Symbolically 
  Captain Nanayakkara who was in charge of the local army camp took building materials 
  from the NGO to put up a prominent Buddhist shrine at Thampalakamam junction.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB><u1:p></u1:p>Later several of the displaced Tamils from Thampalakamam 
  lived in a refugee camp at the Pillaiyar Kovil. While houses were being built 
  for the newly settled Sinhalese, nothing was done for the Tamils. During 1991 
  the camp was closed and they were asked to return to their villages. Fearing 
  for their security they used the money provided for temporary shelter to put 
  up big cadjan sheds in selected compounds where 5 or more families lived together. 
  This situation still prevails to a large extent at the two villages concerned 
  in the incident.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB><u1:p></u1:p>Having the backing of the state and the security 
  forces, the Sinhalese villagers at Sinhapura and Jayapura became overlords in 
  the local context. In other ways their being a privileged community was illusory. 

  They were an underclass distinguished also by caste. The state offered nothing 
  for their social upliftment. They had no viable employment or means on 20 perches 
  of land. Many of the men found employment as armed home guards and made a further 
  income by chopping wood from the teak reserve and selling it as firewood. Their 
  real role was to be low cost human shields for the security forces. <u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p><b><span></span>[Note: Although encroachment is common among landless peasants 
  of all communities in the country as a whole, Sinhalese encroachment in Trincomalee 
  was backed by powerful agents having state patronage, who held out promises 
  of resources and jobs to be provided by the state (eg: &#147; new state and 

  private enterprises). By contrast state violence has been used to uproot counter 
  encroachments by minorities</b>. Examples of this are the forced mass transportation 
  of Hill Country Tamils under cover of the July 1983 violence. These Tamils were 
  already refugees from the 1977 communal violence (Rep. No 11). See also the 
  forced eviction of Muslims from Aakuwatte, Uppuveli under cover of the outbreak 
  of hostilities in June 1990. (<a href="..\SpecialReports\spreport8.htm">Special 
  Rep. No. 8</a>). ] <u1:p><span lang=EN-GB style='letter-spacing:-.15pt;

<h3><a name="_Toc515618779"><span lang=EN-GB><u1:p></u1:p>Night of 31<sup>st</sup> 
  January<u1:p></u1:p></span></a></h3>
<p><u1:p></u1:p>Army ranks in Trincomalee were thinned down for operations in 
  the North and at the time of the incident there was the main police camp at 
  Thampalakamam junction. From the junction going eastwards towards the Tamil 
  villages and the bay, there were two further mini police camps within 700 yards. 
  It is these camps that were involved in the incident. Beyond a mile there is 
  another major police camp. There are also police camps in Sinhapura and Jayapura. 
  The police camp at Monkey Bridge (Palampottaru) and the Army camp at the 96<sup>th</sup> 
  mile post are a considerable distance away. According to local information the 
  LTTE hardly comes to the villages. Their movements are in the jungles to the 
  west or further east towards the coast. During the last year they have visited 
  the villages on two occasions and had called for the youths to join them. Hardly 
  anyone went.<u1:p></u1:p></p>
<p><u1:p></u1:p>On the evening of 31<sup>st</sup> January the police at the 3 
  camps near the villages acquired a huge quantity of illicit liquor and a large 
  number of chickens from local residents. In the night they begun a drunken feast 
  which was followed by continuous automatic firing throughout the night, mostly 

  into the air. At 5.30 in the morning the police along with the home guards at 
  Sinhapura and Jayapura, many of whom were armed with automatic weapons, commenced 
  a round up of the two Tamil villages. What followed was mainly a orgy of assault. 
  Many people were pulled out of their houses and were very badly beaten. Women 
  too were not spared. The armed men also opened fire at chickens and animals. 
  Two cows and about five dogs were killed in this manner. Among the several people 
  badly assaulted is John de Pinto(48) who was beaten till he fell on the ground 
  and was then trampled with boots on his chest. Suresh (18) was kicked in the 
  genitals, trampled on the chest and was injured on the forehead. He now suffers 
  from giddiness. Some others badly affected are Jeyarajah, Thiagarajah, Patkunam 
  and Subramaniam. A number of people were detained and marched towards the police 
  station. The families followed in alarm. The police chased away the families 
  saying that those taken would be questioned and released. Some of those taken 
  were subsequently released including Uthayan(32), a school master, who was one 
  among the two who testified before the magistrate on 3rd February . Eight persons 
  were taken into the police station. A burst of gun fire was subsequently heard 
  and the people concluded that the worst had happened. From the state of the 
  bodies later it was clear that several of them had been badly tortured. One 
  corpse had about 25 bullets in it. The male organ was missing from another corpse 
  suggesting that it was severed before the final killing took place. The 8 persons 
  killed in this manner are: 1.) Ponnambalam Kanagasabai(48), father of 5 children, 
  2.) Arumugam Segar(32), whose first child was 31 days old on that day. 3.) 
  Gunaratnam Sivarajah(27), 4.) Subramaniam Thivakaran (23), sat for O.Levels 
  and awaiting results. 5.) Muruges Janakan(17), Grade 9 (pre O.Level) student. 
  6.) Amirthalingam (14), Grade 9 student. 7.) Amirthalingam Gajendran(17), elder 
  brother of 6., working to support the family. 8.) Nathan Pavalanathan(33), married. 
  <u1:p></u1:p></p>
<p><u1:p></u1:p>At about 8. 30 a.m., following the incident, those who tried to 
  enter the area were dissuaded by the police who claimed that there had been 
  an LTTE attack during the night. This was apparently believed by the leading 
  security officials in Trincomalee. However, word of the true state of affairs 
  got through to Trincomalee that morning and Mr. Sornarajah, the magistrate, 
  visited the area and wanted the bodies to be transferred to the Trincomalee 
  hospital for post-mortem examination. The bodies instead were first sent to 
  Kanthalai hospital. It was in the evening the following day when at the insistence 
  of the magistrate, they were brought to the Trincomalee hospital mortuary in 
  a state where they were already beginning to decompose. In the meantime, as 
  mentioned earlier, leading security officials from Kantalai had visited the 
  villages and given assurances. The magistrate heard two witnesses, including 
  Uthayan master, on 3<sup>rd</sup> February. <u1:p><span lang=EN-GB style='letter-spacing:-.15pt;

<h3><a name="_Toc515618780"><span lang=EN-GB><u1:p></u1:p>Thampalakamam 4<sup>th</sup> 
  February, Golden Jubilee of Independence<u1:p></u1:p></span></a></h3>
<p><u1:p></u1:p>In the morning of this day the country&#146;s golden jubilee of 
  independence was being observed in Colombo with pomp and ceremony appropriate 
  to it. (The tragedy in Thampalakamam was of course blacked out from the state 
  media and among the English papers the Mid-Week Mirror carried an account of 
  it on 4<sup>th</sup> February. No other English or Sinhalese paper has referred 
  to it so far.) Following the 21 gun salute, the best armour the country possessed 
  was paraded before the distinguished guests in the podium. There was a fly past 
  of the best fighter aircraft the country has. In Thampalakamam there was at 
  this time a ceremony of contrasts. At the funeral for those killed in the outrage, 
  SSP Nihal Karunaratne and SP Sanath Nanayakkara, the leading state officials 
  in the Kanthalai division, were in the villages to mark the occasion. Karunaratne, 
  an elderly man from Negombo who spoke fluent Tamil, was deeply upset. He and 
  the SP, requested some of those who had come from Trincomalee to stay close 
  to them in order to keep the people calm. Karunaratne&#146;s demeanour could 
  not have been more different from those of his colleagues taking part in ceremonies 
  in Colombo. He went from house to house consoling the bereaved. He touched the 
  surviving members of each victim&#146;s family individually and begged forgiveness. 
  At one point he pulled out his rosary, showed the crucifix, and said, &#147;I 
  am an SSP. But I do not believe in the gun and I don&#146;t carry a gun. This 
  is what I believe in and carry instead. It is far more powerful than the gun.&#148;<u1:p></u1:p></p>
<p><u1:p></u1:p>Seven of the bodies were then brought to the school for the funeral 
  ceremony. (The remaining body was buried by relatives in Trincomalee.) A large 
  crowd of nearly a thousand people with the children in school uniform were assembled. 
  Initially there was some tension because of the presence of the police officials. 
  However, the GS (Headman) spoke first and calmed the people. When Nihal Karunaratne 
  spoke, he again apologised to the people as a whole, said that the policemen 
  involved in the incident had already been transferred, and gave an assurance 
  that this would not happen again. The crowd responded with spontaneous approval. 
  The police officials were very frank in their discussion with some of those 
  present. The new OIC was too introduced to the people. After the funeral some 
  of the people pointed to two policemen passing by and said that they were involved 
  in the incident and were supposed to have been transferred. The SSP ordered 
  that they be arrested. There still remains a fear among the villagers that they 
  might face reprisals if they testify and identify the culprits. There is scepticism 
  about the transfers. The home guards who took part in the atrocity pose an entirely 
  a different problem. They are people who live in the area and whether transferred 
  or not, their presence would continue. Other recent events in the East too raised 
  scepticism. Seven Muslim home guards were detained on the orders of the Kalmunai 
  magistrate over the reprisal killing of two Tamil civilians in Veeramunai early 
  last December. (The LTTE is said to have killed one Muslim home guard from Sammanthurai.) 
  All seven home guards were released later following the failure of the Tamils 
  at Veeramunai to identify any of them. Similar factors would no doubt operate 
  in Thampalakamam as well.<u1:p><span lang=EN-GB style='letter-spacing:-.15pt;
