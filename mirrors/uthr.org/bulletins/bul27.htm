'><i>Subsequent to our Bulletin 26 on child conscription in the East, there were 
      news reports on the subject and a press release from AI. This bulletin updates 
      the earlier one and elucidates how little the LTTE has been constrained 
      by the publicity. We underscore the predicament of children in the rural 
      East and the powerlessness of parents. At present the international community 
      is preoccupied with what the powers-that-be have dubbed a &quot;war on terrorism&quot; 
      and its tragic fallout. The local media and political establishment are 
      playing out their power games with callous disregard for the gaping pitfalls 
      just ahead. The ongoing tragedy in a corner of this island would tend to 
      be therefore passed by with indifference. Being mindful of this, and yet 
      knowing the trauma of the families concerned, and their desperate entreaties, 
      we feel impelled to publish this update. We trust that these victims would 
      be given a hearing, at least by those who understand the gravity of phenomena 
      involving child soldiers. Their outgrowth, we well know, cannot be confined 
      to a time and place</i>.</span></p>

<h3><a name="_Toc528069745">0. Beyond Grief and Beyond Justice</a> </h3>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
'>The trauma of events speaks louder than words. Before we go into other ramifications, 
  we give a few detailed examples among thousands. These illustrate the tragedy 
  of families wrenched asunder by criminal demands on them and their children.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><b><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt;'>Kumar</span></u></b>, 
  is the 11-year-old son of Mr. &amp; Mrs. Kanthan of Ammanthaveli, North Vaharai. 
  Kumar, the youngest, has an elder sister and two elder brothers. The latter 
  are in Sammnathurai to the south, working in a rice mill. After the LTTE started 
  its forced recruitment, it detained the father and mother in a labour camp, 
  expecting the two elder boys to return. After 15 days, this ploy having failed, 
  the LTTE released the parents and took Kumar for military training. The parents 
  were forced to sign a letter forfeiting their house, rice field, fishing boat, 
  cart and bull. The letter further started that they would never again set foot 
  in Tamil Eelam (the North-East).</p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><b><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt;'>Vathani,</span></u></b><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;'> 
  </span></b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;'>a girl of 13, is the youngest of 
  8 children in the Ponnambalam family from Mudalaikudah. The LTTE demanded a 
  child and made it clear that a refusal would lead to the confiscation of their 
  home and fields, and the family of 10 thrown on the streets.The eldest, a boy, 
  volunteered to go. The others stopped him. In desperation they clutched at what 
  seemed a faint ray of hope. They figured that if Vathani went, she would soon 
  be discharged as being under age. Vathani agreed to go along with this plan.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
'>Mr. &amp; Mrs. Ponnambalam took Vathani to the LTTE office in Kokkadichcholai 
  on the evening of 8th October. They were given a letter and asked to take Vathani 
  to an LTTE camp in Manalpiddy. The parents were made to recite words of mockery 
  that they were giving their daughter to the cause 'wholeheartedly' (<i>'manapoorvamaha'</i>), 
  and a video was taken of this 'voluntary' submission.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
'>The parents went to the same camp at 10.00 AM the following day (9th Oct.) to 
  see Vathani. Vathani, who earlier had no inkling of the trauma of leaving her 
  parents and going into a military environment, broke down crying on seeing them. 
  Between spasms of anguish, she asked to be taken home. However, the parents 
  returned without her, the flower of their life plucked away.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><b><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt;'>Sivaruban</span></u></b><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;'> 
  </span></b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;'>is the 10-year-old son of Mrs. Thirunavukkarasu, 
  a widow from Vaharai. He has an elder sister aged 16. The three of them came 
  to stay with relatives in Vinayagapuram, Valaichenai. This, the mother did for 
  the protection of the children, when the LTTE started its forced recruitment. 
  Though an army-controlled area, the LTTE came there on 15th September and took 
  Sivaruban away by force. The mother screamed, and the sister took poison and 
  was warded for some days at Valaichenai Hospital. The mother returned home to 
  Vaharai with her daughter, her mission having been thwarted.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><b><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt;'>Rajabahu, 
  </span></u></b><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;'>aged 14, the eldest son of the Rajadurais, is from a 
  poor family in Karadian Aru. The LTTE demanded Rajabahu on pain of expropriation 
  and expulsion. The boy accepted his fate unwillingly. Before he went, he asked 
  his mother for a treat and a bottle of aerated water, a luxury in the uncleared 
  area. The mother prepared the parting meal, and the precious bottle of aerated 
  water was placed before the son. In a fit of frustration, Rajabahu smashed the 
  bottle.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
'>The parents then took their son to the LTTE, and made their recital of 'wholehearted 
  giving' before a video camera. These videos will be shown to Tamil audiences 
  abroad as an illustration of the patriotic fervour of Batticaloa parents and 
  children. A sense of guilt in preserving their own children in flourishing circumstances 
  in the West, would no doubt loosen purse strings. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><b><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt;'>Thevaruban</span></u></b><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;'> is the 10-year-old son of Mr. &amp; Mrs. Nallaratnam 
  of Kathiraveli, Vaharai. He has an elder sister who is married. The LTTE demanded 
  his elder brother for military service. This brother being in Colombo, the LTTE 
  took Thevaruban as a hostage, saying that they would release him when his elder 
  brother comes home. Some time later, the Nallaratnams went and remonstrated 
  with the LTTE, demanding Thevaruban back, as he is barely a weaned child. The 
  LTTE refused, saying that they have given him training and will release him 
  only after the liberation struggle is concluded.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><b><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt;'>Nalinikanth,</span></u></b><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;'> 
  </span></b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;'>a boy of 14, is a son of the widow, 
  Mrs.Kalalan, of Kalimadu, Kannankudah. Owing to their poverty, the boy had dropped 
  out of school. The LTTE recently came home and took the boy away forcibly. His 
  mother screamed and fainted.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
'>In all the Batticaloa homes above, a funereal air has been overlaid by a sense 
  of guilt over their children. Life has continued in a desultory, abnormal fashion, 
  with cooking done irregularly and consumed indifferently. In the next example 
  we have suppressed some details for reasons that would become evident.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;'>Kanthan,</span></b><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;'> who just reached 14, is from Kokkadichcholai. He is 
  the second of 3 children, the eldest being a girl. The LTTE came home repeatedly 
  and asked for him. Kanthan did not wish to go and his parents too kept him hidden. 
  The LTTE came and locked their home and told the parents that they would not 
  be allowed in until the boy is handed over. On 8th October, the heart broken 
  parents sent the boy with a close relative, Ratnam.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'>Having obtained a letter from the local LTTE office, 
  they were directed to a centre in Manalpiddy. There the child recruits and their 
  parents were asked to get into a bus to be taken to another place. It was getting 
  dark and the bus had to move slowly along the rutted road. At a bend, Ratnam 
  asked Kanthan to get down and run for it. This was not observed by the LTTE. 
  Kanthan found his way and was hidden by relatives. The next night, a female 
  relative smuggled him out of the LTTE controlled area and he is safe for now.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
'>Oblivious to these appalling events affecting their children, sections of the 
  well-heeled Tamil elite were indulging in strange rituals. The National Peace 
  Council along with two other groups arranged a plush three-day consultation 
  at a hotel in Nilaveli. Several Western diplomats were also present at this 
  conference in early October 2001 that was funded by a Japanese foundation. The 
  decisions at the conference were to serve as a basis for approaching both the 
  Government and the LTTE.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
'>The Sinhalese delegates were silenced by an appeal to their guilt. Through carefully 
  selected speakers, the organisers set the tone. The main message was that the 
  Tamil people are inseparable from the LTTE and this war is to relieve the oppression 
  of the Tamil people by the Government. Some of the supposedly rural Tamil NPC 
  animators were paraded as those who could show the delegates the Tamils in the 
  'uncleared' (i.e. LTTE-controlled) area, if they wished. Away from stage settings, 
  however, the reality is too often ironical.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
'>Thirty miles south, in Vaharai, large numbers of Tamils in the uncleared area 
  were moving towards the lines of the Sri Lankan Army, to protect their children 
  from the LTTE. The LTTE has once more distinguished itself among liberation 
  movements by transforming oppressive state forces into saviours of the oppressed.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'>The LTTE thus, while on the one hand going for massive 
  forcible recruitment of children, which has a vicious, unstoppable dynamism 
  of its own, is using all channels of influence to replace the PA government 
  by a UNP one. With Parliament dissolved and elections in prospect, the UNP, 
  with help from the TULF (that is now allied to the UNP), will be pushed as 
  the party of peace. Both the LTTE and UNP are clear that this convergence of 
  interests is only temporary. </p>
<p style='text-align:justify'>A group of well-connected Tamil journalists is among 
  those active in organising a front of Tamil parties amenable to the LTTE. After 
  the elections, the bargaining power of these front-parties will be used to push 
  for a cease-fire, where rhetoric will substitute for the scantiest guarantees 
  of permanence. The Tamil parties, and particularly the TULF, know well that 
  this would be the cue for the LTTE to extend recruitment of children to urban 
  areas under army control. In this game, Tamil children face the long prospect 
  of untold savagery, shielded by a conspiracy of silence.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
'>Further cases illustrating the LTTE's recruitment drive are given in the Appendix. 
  Local observers place the proportion of minors (under 18s) among the recruits 
  at above 60%. The youngest in the list are in the age group of 10-11. It is 
  observed that they are from the poorest areas and were invariably taken forcibly.<a href="#_Toc528069744">[Top]</a></span></p>
<h3><a name="_Toc528069746">1. Batticaloa: Throwing Away the Velvet Glove</a></h3>
<p style='text-align:justify'>In the wake of resistance, by September end, the 
  pretence of a veneer of legality in child-conscription was thrown to the winds. 
  In Kokkadichcholai, LTTE recruiters coming in a tractor and trailer stopped 
  opposite homes. The parents were called out and asked to give a child. When 
  they refused, they were beaten with <i>panaimattais </i>(dry stems of Palmyrah 
  fronds having abrasive edges). Usually the children came running on hearing 
  the parents scream. The recruiters then asked a child to come along. The child 
  on declining was beaten and forced into the trailer. The use of this method 
  on a larger scale is suggested by testimony of its use also in Karadiyan Aru. 
  The LTTE's current mood is reflected in the leaflet distributed in Valaichenai 
  (see Sec.5 below).</p>
<p style='text-align:justify'>In Vaharai, LTTE recruiters, including an area leader, 
  were assaulted by parents. According to reports from the area, about 20 civilians 
  were detained in a round up by the LTTE. In this move to make up numbers, children 
  of delicate health become early casualties. A mother from Keluthimadu was imprisoned 
  by the LTTE for not handing over a child. In the night she was witness to a 
  newly recruited child of 14 succumbing to an attack of asthma. The body was 
  handed over to the angry parents the next day. </p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
'>Among those punished by the confiscation of their properties for refusing to 
  hand over a child, are Nadesan Overseer, Mr. Sundaramoorthy, and the local Notary 
  Public, all three of them from Pankudaveli. Sundaramoorthy was held in custody 
  by the LTTE and his losses include cows worth Rs.15 lakhs. The Notary's wife 
  was detained for two days. A new board displayed at each one of their houses 
  reads 'THIS IS THE PROPERTY OF THE LIBERATION TIGERS OF TAMIL EELAM, UNAUTHORISED 
  ENTRY IS STRICTLY PROHIBITED'. In what follows we examine the new trends and 
  issues.<a href="#_Toc528069744">[Top]</a></span></p>
<h3><a name="_Toc528069747">2. Vaharai : The Writing on the Wall</a></h3>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
'>In conducting its ongoing forced recruitment of minors in the Batticaloa District, 
  the LTTE was moving area by area, making a clean sweep as it were. During the 
  last days of September the LTTE had intensified its campaign in Vaharai. But 
  there were neighbouring villages where this activity had not taken place, but 
  the writing was literally on the wall. The schools had on their notice board 
  unsigned cyclostyled notices that had also been widely distributed. The gist 
  of the notices is as follows:</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><i>&quot;The Leader is of the opinion that this 
  war should not be prolonged. It must be brought to an end soon so that the 
  coming generations of our people could live in dignity. We must defeat the Sinhalese 
  armed forces that have committed aggression against our soil.</i></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;'>&quot; We now 
  have the requisite weaponry, but it is fighters that we lack. We feel that each 
  family should contribute one member towards the fulfilment of our aim.</span></i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;'></span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
'>Everyone knew that this was an official LTTE notice. The emphasis was on each 
  family contributing one member at least. Age was not talked about and in practice 
  is not an issue. The LTTE had already informed people verbally that those who 
  had sent their children to the army-controlled area must bring them back or 
  lose their property. The dumbfounded parents wanted to make their complaint 
  heard abroad, but felt utterly helpless. A mother of four girls, for instance, 
  who had sent the two elder ones to Valaichenai, was terrified at the thought 
  of bringing them back, but felt she may have no choice.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
'>On 15th June this year, 35 Christian families professing pacifist convictions 
  were expelled from Pannichankerni, in violence orchestrated by the LTTE. The 
  incident in the village south of Vaharai was widely misrepresented as a clash 
  between Hindus and Christians. What lay behind the incident became clear in 
  the coming weeks. On 26th September, 103 days after the Christians were expelled, 
  a similar number of Hindu families from the same village arrived at the army 
  check point near Mankerni in a quest to save their children from the LTTE.<a href="#_Toc528069744">[Top]</a></span></p>
<h3><a name="_Toc528069748">3. Religious Leaders call on the LTTE</a> </h3>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
'>From early August reports of compulsory recruitment had struck fear among the 
  people and had become the talk of the town in Batticaloa. The LTTE had also 
  spoken of an imminent attack by them on Batticaloa itself. After weeks of anguished 
  consultation, a group of religious and secular leaders decided to talk to the 
  LTTE. After an exchange of messages and obtaining clearance from the Brigade 
  Commander, Batticaloa, a delegation led by the Rt. Rev. Kingsley Swampillai, 
  Bishop of Batticaloa and Trincomalee, crossed the lagoon from Paddiruppu and 
  met the LTTE at their office in Ambalanthurai. This was at 10.30 AM on 25th 
  September. The delegation also included Mr.Pathmanathan, representing the Swamy 
  at the Ramakrishna Mission, Mr.Sugunathas representing the Methodist Church, 
  Mr.Kamalanathan the local NGO sector and Mr.Martyn representing the Batticaloa 
  Peace Committee.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
'>The LTTE was represented by its Eastern commander, Mr.Karikalan himself. The 
  religious leaders voiced their concerns guardedly and listened to Karikalan's 
  explanations. The result was revealing in many respects, particularly as regards 
  the powerlessness of the Tamil people before their acclaimed leaders.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
'>Bishop Swampillai told Karikalan that people were talking about forced recruitment 
  by his group. The latter replied that this was incorrect and that the parents 
  were giving their children to the LTTE voluntarily. To back this claim, he showed 
  the visitors a video of supposedly such an event. The claim was belied by the 
  scene of mothers shedding tears in profusion. Karikalan however made an important 
  concession. He said that those who had given a child often pressed their neighbours 
  to follow suit.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'>When the subject of [more than a dozen] suicides 
  by parents having to part with their children was raised, Karikalan put it down 
  to quarrels between the parents themselves: If a mother, say, gave a child, 
  the father might pick a quarrel with her and swallow sleeping tablets. Karikalan 
  denied that they were confiscating the properties of those who declined to contribute 
  a child. He said that they were only protecting the properties of persons who 
  left and would give it back when they returned. This again as several incidents 
  above, which took place well after this meeting, show, is a blatant falsehood.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
'>Karikalan made no concession to the concerns of the religious leaders and held 
  forth about the need to liberate the land and their aims and methods. He said 
  that this struggle was not a career for them and they would like to end it soon. 
  It was appropriate, he said, that every family should contribute a fighter so 
  that they would feel it to be their struggle. It is because they did not want 
  people to suffer during the coming months of fighting, he continued, that they 
  had asked the people to store 3 months' rations. Batticaloa town, he said, would 
  be liberated by January 2002 and the struggle will go on with added strength.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span></span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
'>The Bishop interjected that they [the LTTE] had made similar utterances when 
  they declared a final war in 1990. The outcome, he observed, was that the LTTE 
  fled to the jungles, leaving the people to suffer enormous reprisal violence. 
  Karikalan replied that they were not ready then, but they are now.( It was the 
  same Karikalan who was in charge in the East in 1990!)</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
'>Reflecting the anxieties of the delegation, one member expressed the hope that 
  there would be peace before all this violence takes place. Karikalan dismissed 
  the idea saying that the Government is not interested in peace and laughed. 
  Everyone laughed at the irony of the hope.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
'>The question then arose about the fate of members of the other Tamil groups 
  when the LTTE's 'liberation' of Batticaloa is accomplished. Karikalan said that 
  if these other groups join now their fight for liberation, they would welcome 
  them with open arms. But should they fall into their hands after the fight, 
  he added, they would all be massacred.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
'>Throughout the discussion the religious leaders did not contest the LTTE's contentions, 
  but only indicated that they had a different view of things, especially the 
  ongoing recruitment. In closing, Bishop Swampillai made what in normal circumstances 
  would be an ironical plea to an acclaimed liberation leader. He told Karikalan 
  <i>'to see that the people are not harmed in the process of liberating them'.</i></span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
'>What this exchange indicated is the alarming fact of leading members of Tamil 
  society having lost all influence with their acclaimed leaders. They were even 
  unable to make the most routine humanitarian demands from them. Through their 
  extreme caution, even the Tamil religious leaders have allowed their authority 
  and initiative to be usurped. By contrast, whatever the merits of their opinions, 
  the religious leaders in the South do speak out and are at least heard. In the 
  North- East, the pusillanimity of civil society has enabled the LTTE to erode 
  all healthy social values, leaving the people at a total loss. The step taken 
  by the religious leaders in Batticaloa must be commended for doing more than 
  what anyone else was willing to do. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
'>The LTTE has destroyed all notions of right and wrong, leaving the people with 
  no grounds to resist even the most criminal of demands. This is clearly seen 
  in the ongoing recruitment around Batticaloa.<a href="#_Toc528069744">[Top]</a></span></p>
<h3><a name="_Toc528069749"><u>4. The People : Denuded and Disowned</u></a></h3>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
'>Some common reactions by parents to demands made by the LTTE to sign off their 
  children, have exhibited the nakedness of the people in starkly tragic terms. 
  Seldom is their first resort to point to the wrong, inhumanity and abhorrence 
  of the demand.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'>In a futile move to protect their own children, 
  they start clamouring, <i>&quot;How about your village headman, has he given 
  his son? Why are you doing this only to us rural folk? Why not to the families 
  in Batticaloa town? How about the families in Jaffna and elsewhere in the North?&quot;</i> 
  It is politics that thrives by feeding on envy, revenge, and on the desire to 
  teach those who escape a lesson.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
'>This ruinous state of affairs is sustained by two things. One is the elimination 
  of sane and moral voices from within the society who dared to dissent. Second, 
  this elimination reinforced conditions where the leaders of society became inert. 
  They failed to condemn inhuman demands made on the people, and to stand by them 
  firmly in the assertion of their rights.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
'>Take the mission of the religious leaders above. Reading between the lines, 
  Bishop Swampillai is no less skeptical of the LTTE and its methods than any 
  sensible man would be. But after the mission nothing changed. The Tamil press 
  tamely reported Karikalan's vindication of the LTTE's stand. Indeed, the religious 
  leaders did not go to Karikalan on the basis of reports or rumours. They knew 
  for certain through a stream of testimonies over eight weeks. But in their address 
  to Karikalan, instead of demanding cessation and restoration, they spoke of 
  'talk among people', which Karikalan simply denied. The LTTE thus cornered the 
  religious leaders, making it difficult for them to express their outrage publicly 
  thereafter, and to give the people leadership in their hour of need. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
'>The people, so disowned by those who should have stood by them, are condemned 
  to creeping brutalisation. This particular instance involving the religious 
  leaders is just a local reflection of what has come to be accepted wisdom in 
  dealing with the LTTE. It has now the stamp of approval from the international 
  community. Anyone in an organisation having dealings with the LTTE, would risk 
  his career by confronting them.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
'>The <i>Veerakesari </i>of 21st September carried an account of an ICRC press 
  conference. The ICRC official said, with reference to allegations of forced 
  recruitment in the Batticaloa District, that they had received no complaints. 
  The Tamil press used this in such a manner as to support their cover-up of what 
  the LTTE was doing. The people of Batticaloa were angry and felt that the ICRC 
  could at least have remained silent.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
'>The ICRC of course knew and was no doubt concerned. A slightly earlier confidential 
  report by an international agency represented in the area spoke of LTTE recruitment 
  of children in the interior of Batticaloa. It referred to reports of recruits 
  below 11 years, but generally in the age group around 15. The interior was likened 
  to a funeral house with relatives mourning the loss of a loved one.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
'>Yet no international agency on the ground has so far raised the issue in public. 
  The rationale is again one of dealing with the LTTE with extreme caution, trying 
  not to give them cause for offence. In part, this approach has its roots in 
  widespread skepticism about the Sri Lankan State and Sinhalese polity, and their 
  proverbial inability to do anything constructive. This however leaves the cardinal 
  question unanswered: What about the people? A large section of the peace lobby, 
  prompted by articulate Tamils in their midst, has answered this question by 
  asserting that the Tamil people have chosen to follow the LTTE. This complacent 
  and self-serving answer becomes callouser and shallower by the day.<a href="#_Toc528069744">[Top]</a></span></p>
<h3><a name="_Toc528069750">5. Back to the Sangam Age!</a></h3>
<p style='text-align:justify'>The methods of recruitment referred to clearly show, 
  however, that the LTTE has no illusions about the support of the people for 
  its project. Its propaganda leaders in the East have called upon the people 
  to return to the glorious <i>Sangam age</i>- the classical age of Tamil literature, 
  1st - 2nd centuries AD. Attention is drawn prominently to a verse from the 
  collection <i>Puranaanooru</i> that romanticises mothers taking pride in anointing 
  their sons and sending them to win glory or honourable death in war. The crucial 
  aspect is conveniently suppressed. The ancient bards of the <i>Puranaanooru</i> 
  would have been outraged at their poetical licence being used to drag in women 
  and children as soldiers.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
'>It should be evident by now that the use of Tamil classics without context is 
  double-edged. <b>Ariyamalar</b> (40) of Kiran is a mother whose young son was 
  taken by the LTTE in late September. She became mentally disturbed and swore 
  that she would deal with her tormentors who deprived her of a loved one in the 
  same manner that Kannakai dealt with hers. Kannakai is the heroine of the Jain 
  Tamil classic, <i>The Anklet, </i>by Illango Addikal. Kannaki's husband Kovalan 
  was wrongly charged with theft and executed by the king of Madurai. So strong 
  was the force of chastity in the injured woman that it set Madurai aflame, and 
  its king with it. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
'>By the end of September, the LTTE was angry and nonplussed by the hostility 
  evoked around Batticaloa by its compulsory call to arms. Its attempts to pass 
  off coercion as a spontaneous response had also failed. Instead, there was a 
  brazenly open breach of its pledges to the UN on child recruitment. Earlier 
  it was a question of whether the 'voluntariness' in a child becoming a soldier 
  could be morally accepted. Although the answer was a resounding no, many adult 
  members of the Tamil elite blurred the issue by praising the courage and patriotic 
  fervour of children of the lower orders bearing arms. But what is going on around 
  Batticaloa posses even graver questions. The parents are being coerced to sign 
  off their children in a travesty of legality. It is even more a question of 
  child slavery of a lethal kind.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
'>The LTTE distributed a pamphlet in Valaichenai in early October. This time there 
  was no attempt at formal concealment. It was signed with the LTTE emblem and 
  the slogan, <i>'The thirst of the Tigers is for their motherland of Tamil Eelam'. 
  </i>It called upon the parents to contribute a child and expedite the birth 
  of Tamil Eelam in Prabhakaran's lifetime, by getting rid of the 'Sinhalese Army'. 
  Giving some idea of their target figure, the pamphlet observed that getting 
  rid of the 3000 to 5000 strong army contingent in the Batticaloa District would 
  be an easy task.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
'>The pamphlet went on:<i> &quot;You parents of Valaichenai, ponder a little. 
  The parents of Batticaloa are re-enacting the Puranaanooru. In spite of all 
  the difficulties they are voluntarily binding a child to the LTTE to achieve 
  victory in the liberation struggle. We soon expect the people of Valaichenai 
  to follow their example&quot;</i></span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
'>With sly sarcasm it told the parents: <i>&quot;We are therefore determined to 
  call on you and speak to you directly in your home.&quot; </i>Addressing the 
  youth, it said:<i> &quot; Young men and maidens of Valaichenai, rise and come 
  to us, one from each home, to liberate the soil of Batticaloa from the enemy.&quot;</i></span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
'>The message was, in short, send us a child or we will come and help ourselves. 
  As one might guess from the leaflet and as is increasingly evident in practice, 
  no age criterion is being observed. We may also observe the shifts of meaning 
  in the LTTE's declarations to different categories of persons. It has consistently 
  told rural folk, as implicit in the leaflet above, that it will persist in a 
  fight for a separate state, whatever the cost. It cannot be otherwise, for it 
  has continually killed those who differ and intimated those who tried to start 
  a peace movement whenever the LTTE apparently agreed to negotiate. To this rural 
  constituency, any pronouncements on the Government's willingness or unwillingness 
  to negotiate, will be superfluous and even confusing.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
'>It is to the middle class constituency that propaganda about the Government's 
  supposed obduracy, and unwillingness to negotiate an equitable political arrangement, 
  is addressed. The Tamil media in Colombo carry out this task faithfully. It 
  supplies the urban middle classes with justification for turning a blind eye 
  to criminal impositions on rural folk and the continuing decimation of the community, 
  while at the same time treating the LTTE's military feats with children as sporting 
  news. Just observe how Karikalan's simplistic assertion of the Government's 
  unwillingness to negotiate, closed the discussion of an important question - 
  that of child soldiers - taken up by the delegation of religious leaders from 
  Batticaloa.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
'>We need to be clear that we are dealing with very young, unwilling children 
  of unwilling parents being coerced into arms by a desperate and unscrupulous

<h3><a name="_Toc528069751">6. Child Soldiers and Serial Disasters</a> </h3>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
'>Given the nature of current recruitment, it is useful to look back at the situation 
  in June 1990, which Bishop Swampillai cautioned against. A large number of very 
  young children were joining the LTTE in early 1990 for very different reasons. 
  The Indian Army was leaving and the UNP government of President Premadasa was 
  pampering the LTTE with money and new vehicles. Many children, especially from 
  impoverished homes, ran away and joined the LTTE. To them, sporting a gun and 
  uniform grown-up-like and joining the carnival, where <i>coca cola</i> flowed 
  freely, seemed irresistible. But the LTTE was very clear about renewing the 
  war.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
'>Behind the carnival atmosphere, the LTTE was saturating these children with 
  war rhetoric. They were repeatedly harangued on Tamil Eelam being the only solution 
  and the sacred duty of eliminating 'traitors' who disagreed. The LTTE's cordiality 
  with Premadasa and its constant professions of good faith became increasingly 
  incompatible with the highly charged atmosphere it had fomented within. It could 
  not hold down the lid much longer. Even those close to the LTTE were surprised 
  that it resumed hostilities so early in June 1990. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
'>Karikalan's contention that they were then unprepared in very misleading. They 
  were preparing themselves methodically with a series of provocations intended 
  to invite severe reprisals against Tamil civilians. These provocations were 
  made the more vexatious by their total unexpectedness. They included the murder 
  of hundreds of surrendered Sinhalese and Muslim policemen and massacres of Muslim 
  civilians living in close proximity to the Tamils (see our reports of that period). 
  The LTTE then vanished into the jungles, taking frightened boys and girls along, 
  leaving the Tamil civilians in the East exposed to the fury of the Army, STF 
  and the newly formed Muslim Homeguards.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
'>To bind the children who may have second thoughts, the LTTE charged them with 
  hate against especially the Muslims, and gave meaning to their membership as 
  a vehicle of vengeance. They were then made to participate in massacres. We 
  saw then a terrifying march of serial disasters.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
'>That was 1990. Eleven years on, the people have learnt a great deal more about 
  the LTTE the hard way. They have no illusions. For today's coerced recruits 
  there is no semblance of a carnival. The only certainty is death or disablement. 
  The LTTE has nothing to show for its rhetoric and repeated declarations of 'final 
  battle' except serial disasters. These include a decimated population, widows, 
  crippled children, repeated displacement, shifting frontiers and a land treacherously 
  strewn with mines. And the LTTE is fated to go on in the same manner, to the 
  end.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
'>Today the mood among the recruits is far more difficult to handle than in 1990. 
  They feel cheated, humiliated and resentful. They are angry at the way their 
  parents were treated. The LTTE has added to its problems by inaugurating this 
  special technique of recruitment in rural Batticaloa. Faced with local resentment, 
  the LTTE has made rash pledges. It has praised the people of Batticaloa for 
  upholding <i>Puranaanooru</i> traditions and added that they have been the torchbearers 
  for all other districts, which will now follow them. They have promised that 
  the same methods would be applied to Batticaloa town, the Vanni and even to 
  Jaffna. The LTTE will be forced to try, if only to placate its Eastern conscripts, 
  and then get into enormous problems.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
'>Consequently, the LTTE will have even less control over events. It is already 
  in flagrant breach of its pledge to the UN on child recruitment. Any further 
  pledges it makes will be governed only by momentary expediency. One of its first 
  priorities would be to bind the recruits and turn civilian resentment away from 
  itself. It is here that the 1990 experience becomes relevant. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
'>The LTTE's vein of politics, abetted by the TULF, has in Batticaloa been steadily 
  building Tamil resentment against the local Muslims. The Muslims are today feeling 
  very anxious and insecure. In recent times the LTTE has squeezed the Muslims 
  for money while avoiding overt violence. The LTTE's new compulsions make the 
  situation explosive, particularly in view of Karikalan's reputation. The LTTE's 
  compulsions must be set against its apparently contradictory support for the 
  UNP and attempts to manipulate December's parliamentary elections. Coupled with 
  the forced mass recruitment of resentful children, there is an explosive build-up 
  that heightens the prospect of another round of serial disasters.<a href="#_Toc528069744">[Top]</a></span></p>
<h3><a name="_Toc528069752">7. The Crucial Challenge</a></h3>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
'>What was always inherent, and in many ways inevitable, is now taking shape before 
  our eyes as a whirlwind. It must spend itself out, leaving wrecked humanity 
  in its wake. The Government appears too preoccupied to take notice and the UNP 
  is not thinking beyond December's elections. The community leaders in Batticaloa, 
  alarmed as they are, are looking for someone else to deal with it. The leading 
  Tamil party, the TULF, has played itself out into destructive irrelevance. It 
  is now incapable of addressing the realities facing the people. It is fated 
  as it were, to serenade the siren that draws, inexorably, the ship of the Tamil 
  Nation to its doom.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
'>The Tamil leadership and civil society as a whole have lost the ability to tell 
  the people that turning their children into soldiers and torturers is criminal 
  and, moreover, to force parents to sign off their children into such a fate 
  is doubly criminal. No parent has the right to do it.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
'>Sri Lanka can boast of a wide-ranging international presence performing a variety 
  of humanitarian services. They do this amidst attempts by the warring parties 
  to bully and nudge them. At one level there is much that is similar between 
  any two sides at war. But then, it is important to ask if there has been an 
  error of judgement after all these years of sheer repetitiveness :- viz. Cease-fire, 
  Talks, Intensification of child recruitment by the LTTE, War resumes, Civilians 
  killed, Frontiers change, International agencies pull out of vulnerable areas 
  and civilians follow, New minefields, International agencies move back to assess 
  damage and make funding proposals for humanitarian assistance, New attempts 
  at cease-fire, Life goes on.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
'>The priority of the international agencies appears to be to somehow maintain 
  contact with the LTTE and avoid confrontation, so that, technically at least, 
  their work can go on. Given stark choices by the LTTE, they are bound to compromise. 
  One sees something of the ground rules of the game where it has become almost 
  impossible to confront the LTTE and hold it to account. The agencies are confronted 
  with the dilemmas of doing humanitarian work among civilians, whom the LTTE 
  has no qualms about using as dispensable pawns in a military game. In turn the 
  people are equally helpless when bombed from the air by an irate state.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
'>'Peace' has become the magic word to bridge the contradictions of this impossible 
  state of affairs. As a corollary, 'Human Rights' has become an inexpedient expression 
  because it gives offence to the LTTE. We gave some indication earlier on how 
  the 'Peace' game is being played. It is finally the LTTE that decides the agenda 
  and the LTTE has never made the slightest substantive concession to anyone. 
  This is why the future of the LTTE's child recruits looks utterly hopeless.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
'>For example, one wishes the ICRC could say, after 12 years in Sri Lanka, that 
  their instructors have made some impact on the LTTE leadership, particularly 
  on observing the humanitarian law. But take Karikalan's blood-curdling prospect 
  held out to members of other groups who would fall into their hands upon the 
  'liberation of Batticaloa'.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
'>This was not a perfunctory remark. It was a frank statement made to a group 
  of leading moral authorities in Batticaloa. The LTTE has right along maintained 
  that all Tamils who opposed them are less than vermin. No quarter was ever acknowledged 
  or given, even to those who advocated perfectly decent alternatives to the LTTE's 
  agenda of collective suicide. If all attempts to make an impact on the LTTE 
  as regards the humanitarian law and child soldiers have failed dismally, it 
  is because a malignant approach to these issues is part and parcel of its politics. 
  </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
'>When the ordinary Tamil people speak with their feet, by running towards army 
  lines, it is a damningly eloquent indictment of the LTTE's politics. The moral 
  judgements we sought to avoid are being forced on us. By playing down issues 
  of right and wrong as the price for dealing with the LTTE, we have found the 
  contradictions becoming increasingly bizarre. The accepted wisdom of dealing 
  with the LTTE, by avoiding even the very basic moral questions, is irrevocably 
  in crisis.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
'>We must therefore restore the values of right and wrong and of Crimes Against 
  Humanity in this discussion. We are on a firm footing only when we make demands 
  on the grounds of what is right. We are dealing with a tendency where the brutality 
  stems not primarily from those like Karikalan, but from an articulate section 
  in the globalised upper reaches of Tamil society. Their callousness is such 
  that they are determined to prove a point at any cost to their people. Their 
  key success has been their facility to confuse the world about the true nature 
  of the LTTE phenomenon.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
'>The time to be confused is long past. We pointed out that a phenomenon founded 
  on child soldiers is not only an evil in itself, but moreover, the resulting 
  climate, by its very unpredictability, is pregnant of a devastating chain of 
  evils. Whatever the peace community would wish, the whirlwind must blow itself 
  out.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
'>The LTTE's current round of child recruitment must be challenged, stating frankly 
  what it means and portends. What we say, and also do, must leave no room for 
  confusion. The LTTE, as Amnesty International has already demanded, must not 
  just stop child recruitment, but must further release all those taken. Not only 
  the children, but also the young women and farmers abducted from the streets 
  and their homes.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
'>There can be no neutrality in the face of such a crime. If the organisations 
  representing the world community are not seen to take a clear position on this 
  matter, their presence becomes largely meaningless for the ordinary people. 
  On the other hand, a clear stand by them will also help local civil society 
  groups, and finally the parents themselves, to defy the LTTE. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'>If all efforts fail, and these children are forced 
  into battle formations, means must be found to help them escape and surrender 
  rather than get blown up into smithereens. There can be no great credit to 
  a government in blowing up its own children.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
'>Given the present political uncertainties in the country, the International 
  Community faces a crucial challenge. They must prepare for deadly outcomes affecting 
  Tamil children and take all preventive measures possible.<a href="#_Toc528069744">[Top]</a></span></p>

<h3><a name="_Toc528069754">Press-Ganging of Children and Adults</a></h3>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
'>In what follows we give, in addition to the cases above, further examples of 
  children and young adults forcibly removed by the LTTE. The force is not necessarily 
  wholly physical, although it frequently is in the case of the youngest recruits. 
  When for example the LTTE visit a home, threaten to turn the inmates out and 
  lay their hands on a child, the parents often find themselves in a quandary. 
  Account must also be taken of many years of conditioning by the political environment 
  and the media. Resistance to the LTTE has been made to appear illegitimate and 
  useless. <a href="#_Toc528069744">[Top]</a></span></p>

<p><span></span><b>Mr.Gunaseelan (29) </b>of Munaikkadu was absconding after 
  being called up by the LTTE. His father was detained as a hostage. The father 
  was confined to a labour camp and the strain proved too much for him. He was 
  released by Gunaseelan's younger sister, who surrendered herself to the LTTE 
  for her father's sake.</p>
<p><span style='font-size:12.0pt;'>The total taken from the Batticaloa District 
  may be placed at above 2000. Local sources place the number taken from Munaikkadu 
  at well above 100.</span></p>
<p><span style='font-size:12.0pt;'>It may also be noted that the children in the 
  list from Valaichenai were taken from a technically 'cleared' area. There are 
  signs that recruiting agents may even be operating in Batticaloa town. In testimony 
  received by us, an eleven year old boy was accosted by a man who told him that 
  his father had been admitted to hospital and offered to take him there. The 
  boy ran away from him.</span> <a href="#_Toc528069744">[Top]</a></p>
