<h4>&nbsp; </h4>
<h3><a name="_Toc515621868"><span lang=EN-GB><u1:p></u1:p>Introduction</span></a></h3>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB><u1:p></u1:p>Elephant Pass fell to 
  the LTTE on 21<sup>st</sup> April 2000 and there followed a month of grave anxiety 
  when the fall of the entire Jaffna peninsula seemed imminent. President Kumaratunge 
  placed the country on a war-footing, external help was sought and a new military 
  commander was placed in charge of the North. Troop morale which was at a low 
  ebb revived sufficiently to inflict two significant defeats on the LTTE at Kilaly 
  and Sarasalai, halting the LTTE advance for the present, restoring some stability 
  by 21<sup>st</sup> May. However, the short term picture is grim.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>Not only foreign missions and international 
  agencies based here, but even the Government, and activist groups who represent 
  this country to the outside world, do not appear to have come to terms with 
  what happened in April, the nature of the LTTE, its moves and its motivating 
  aims. The main cause of the crisis are however the wounds the Government inflicted 
  on itself from the time of its brazen misconduct during the NWPC elections in 
  January 1999. Coupled to the military setback in November 1999, the Government 
  was getting tangled up in desultory polemics whose adverse effect on the security 
  forces was evident in the early months of this year. However by the month of 
  February (2000) the UNP had agreed to support the Government&#146;s constitutional 
  reform proposals and Norway had been brought in formally as a facilitator. On 
  the surface the prospects for a negotiated settlement were looking bright. But 
  there was a key reality which nearly all the actors had lost sight of.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>The January-February issue of &#145;Liberation 
  Tigers&#146; published in the Vanni asked in its lead item, &#145;What is Next? 
  War or Peace!&#146; It went on to answer the question: &#147;The Sinhalese Government 
  has totally rejected our demands for third party mediation and for the Thimpu 
  Principles as the basis for negotiations. Therefore the Sri Lankan Government 
  cannot be expected to co-operate with Norway&#146;s efforts. It would be therefore 
  foolish to expect the Chandrika government to open the door of peace and conduct 
  itself with fairness and justice&#148;<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>The same page had a picture of the 
  LTTE leader Prabhakaran pointing at Jaffna on a map of Tamil Eelam with his 
  left forefinger. Beneath it was the verse, &#147;<i>Where Sooriya Thevan (Sun 
  God) points with his finger, thither the sun rays will hasten, to enfold Thamil 
  Eelam in the brightness of his glory!&#148; <u1:p></u1:p></i></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>On page 5 of the same journal was 
  a large map of the area surrounding Elephant Pass army camp, describing the 
  LTTE&#146;s advances in December 1999. From the attention paid to the east coast 
  and the arrows shown in some detail pointing to the Army&#146;s new defences, 
  there was a clear indication that they would isolate Elephant Pass by cutting 
  off the A9 trunk road from the north. The people in Jaffna had guessed it. The 
  Army had been unprepared in the past, but this time something seemed to have 
  snapped within. The LTTE leader had been saying for some time that he would 
  take Jaffna by the year 2000. <u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>The people in Jaffna, the Vanni and 
  the East, as well as the Sinhalese people, badly wanted peace. The Army too 
  was weary. Yet, the war seemed destined to go on, beyond the control of the 
  majority who want peace. Having gone through many years of destruction, it was 
  the dream of the people in the North-East that a democratic political solution 
  will be in place which would eventually remove any armed presence.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>There was a far greater tragedy that 
  lay unseen and was carefully suppressed. The sunrays that do the Sun God&#146;s 
  bidding are today mainly children, often 14 or 15 years old, and increasingly 
  girls. In specific cases we have ascertained that LTTE cadre who died during 
  the period of the Elephant Pass battle were aged 15.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>One was a girl who had joined two 
  years earlier aged 13. Two girls had joined a year earlier aged 14. What is 
  the plight of a society which is subject to such demands? How do the parents 
  take it? Do they spontaneously support the LTTE?<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>There is a big lie that has been sold 
  to the world. The myth that these people wholly support the LTTE is seldom questioned. 
  That the Tamil people in the North-East support the LTTE has been given credence 
  by leading NGOs in the South, creating unwarranted optimism that the problem 
  is going to be solved by the Government talking to the LTTE with help from Norway. 

  So abysmal is the level of discourse that the absurdity of talking about &#145;support&#146; 
  when the freedom to discuss options is brutally suppressed, is ignored.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>Even more grave is the refusal to 
  see the tragedy and humiliation faced by the people - all fellow citizens of 
  this small country. To impose on them convenient beliefs about their disposition 
  - often flattering to vocal members of the Tamil elite not affected by the war 
  - amounts to arrogance that is also cruel. <u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>A hint of what it is like in the Vanni 
  came from the testimony of people who had a taste of it. &#147;It is true&#148;, 
  they said, &#147;there are human rights violations under the Government of Sri 
  Lanka. But here, there is not a shadow of human rights!&#148; This is no more 
  evident than in the manner in which children are recruited for military service.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>The plight of those living under the 
  LTTE is the main subject of this bulletin. We will also touch on Government&#146;s 
  failures to check violations by the security forces which helps the LTTE and 
  its lobby to get away with it.<u1:p></u1:p></span><span lang=EN-GB><u1:p></u1:p><a href="#_Toc515621866">[Top]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="_Toc515621869">1.The Government: A Record of Callousness<u1:p></u1:p></a></h2>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>We had pointed out in earlier reports that the Government&#146;s 
  inability to effectively stop violations in the form of missing persons, torture 
  of prisoners and indiscriminate killings of civilians, gives credibility to 
  the LTTE propaganda, particularly among those outside the North. This results 
  from the Government&#146;s own indiscipline and incompetence. It has left behind 
  a trail of uninvestigated crimes that constantly reawaken doubts of the worst 
  kind. On 12<sup>th</sup> April, Traditional New Year&#146;s eve, a Tamil musical 
  show in Trincomalee was disrupted by a grenade explosion which killed several 
  members of the audience. A few days later the Police ruled out the LTTE as 
  being the cause of the explosion. This also indicated that they had received 
  some information. But we understand that the case has been closed.<u1:p></u1:p></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>We have been told by well-placed civilian sources that 
  elements in the security forces had been responsible for this communally motivated 
  attack in what the Government has declared the &#145;City of Peace&#146;. This 
  view is also shared by well-informed Sinhalese residents committed to a plural 
  Trincomalee. They felt that by covering up this incident the Government was 
  opening the way to communal disharmony. They wanted the culprits punished. On 
  Vesak Day, 17<sup>th</sup> May, there was tension in Trincomalee as Sinhalese 
  residents anticipated a reprisal attack. Initially the news of the bomb explosion 
  in Batticaloa on that day was thought to be such a reprisal.<u1:p></u1:p></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Under the prevailing press censorship the Government 
  claimed that the 17 victims killed were victims of an LTTE outrage on a day 
  sacred to the Buddhists and was intended to provoke a backlash. Except for the 
  Tamil papers, the Press in this small country did not question this version. 
  About 4.30 PM a bicycle had been found parked by a row of shops on Trincomalee 
  Road near the office of DIG/Police. The Buddhist temple was a small distance 
  inside on a by-road. The shop-keepers had suspected a bomb inside a box on the 
  bicycle and informed the Police. The Police had been careless about it and had 
  apparently meddled with the box. A loud explosion was heard and about 3 policemen 
  were killed. Some shops were damaged.<u1:p></u1:p></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Police sergeant Perinpam Uthayanan, a respected figure 
  and treasurer of the St.Michael&#146;s College OBA, was on the road keeping 
  people away. He was speaking to Fr.Chandra who had accompanied a group of children 
  from Aythiyamalai, who came to see the Vesak celebration. The children were 
  in a van. About 10 minutes later a group of the Special Forces came from Brigade 
  HQ on their motorbikes and fired many rounds indiscriminately.<u1:p></u1:p></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Despite Fr.Chandra&#146;s appeal, they fired at the 
  van killing 9 children and injuring several others. They also killed Sergeant 
  Uthayanan who was in police uniform and was well-known. Some persons were dragged 
  out of shops and killed. The outrage was covered up.<u1:p></u1:p></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>At Batticaloa Hospital the MSF recovered several bullets 
  from dead and injured victims. However the JMO certified that the victims had 
  died of a bomb explosion. The Police and the Magistrate did not go beyond this, 
  although the van carrying the children even as shown in the TV news evinced 
  neat lines of regularly spaced holes as one would expect from an automatic weapon 
  rather than a from a bomb. The first step of pulling up the Brigadier Zacky 
  and asking him to identify the men who committed the massacre was evidently 
  not taken. It was said in Colombo that the President had delayed the broadcast 
  of the news ( the government version) to prevent a backlash against the Tamils.<u1:p></u1:p></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Responsible persons in Batticaloa do believe that the 
  massacre was planned in advance. In earlier months there had been mine attacks 
  by the LTTE on vehicles carrying troops within Batticaloa town limits. But the 
  soldiers had generally behaved themselves. They associate the Vesak incident 
  with a mood of impunity resulting from putting the country on a war-footing, 
  where some group in the Army decided that the next time there was an incident 
  they would act in this fashion. It must be noted that there was a gap of 10 
  minutes and the Police on the spot were calm and did not do any firing. We may 
  also mention that throughout the crisis involving the fall of Elephant Pass, 
  the behaviour of troops in Jaffna towards the civilians was commendable.<u1:p></u1:p></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Even so late in the day when the cost of justice faltering 
  in incidents such as those above is well understood, the Government persists 
  in cover-ups. More damagingly, the responsibility for covering up goes right 
  up to the President when no action is taken on requests for an independent inquiry 
  by Tamil parliamentarians. Where does it leave the credibility of devolution? 
  <u1:p></u1:p></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>We may say that after more than 4 years, the Government&#146;s 
  attitude towards civilian casualties in the North-East has not changed. In July 
  1995 the covering up of the bombing of civilians near the Navaly Church went 
  right up to the President. In November 1995 a good GA in Jaffna was sacked for 
  giving the accurate figure of 104 civilians killed by aerial bombing during 
  the month of October 1995 when asked by agencies based in Colombo.<u1:p></u1:p></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>During the post - Elephant Pass crisis this year, under 
  a declaration of &#145;war-footing&#146;, the official Media Information Centre 
  whenever referring to civilian deaths in Jaffna, blamed them all on the LTTE, 
  although it is clear that a significant number died from aerial bombing and 
  shelling by government forces. Sometimes the Government pointed the finger at 
  itself through its own incompetence. <u1:p></u1:p></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>On 20<sup>th</sup> May shells fell on the old people&#146;s 
  home at Kaithady killing 15 elders and wounding 24. The 6.00 PM SLBC Tamil radio 
  news of 21<sup>st</sup> May did not mention the incident, but talked about the 
  Army taking special measures in Jaffna to protect charitable institutions such 
  as orphanages etc and charged that the LTTE was using civilians as shields. 
  The 8.45 PM English SLBC news which followed, reported the incident and blamed 
  it on the LTTE. It is only an impartial inquiry that could decide the truth. 
  <u1:p></u1:p></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Using censorship to handle civilian deaths in this 
  cavalier manner does little to enhance the people&#146;s trust in the Government. 
  The Government&#146;s failures are part of the devastating success of the LTTE. 
  We have mentioned three in a continuing succession of incidents (see AI releases). 
  The Government that constantly talks about the LTTE&#146;s use of children at 
  the UN, must ponder the future of those children who survived the massacre by 
  the Special Forces, and of their friends.<u1:p></u1:p><span lang=EN-GB><a href="#_Toc515621866">[Top]</a></span></p>
<h1><a name="_Toc515621870"><span lang=EN-GB>2. For the Sun God&#146;s Alter</span></a></h1>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB><u1:p></u1:p>After the LTTE engineered 
  the forced exodus from Jaffna in October 1995, there were many children from 
  Jaffna idling in the Vanni. The areas where the 2,00,000 displaced from Jaffna 
  settled in considerable numbers include Mallavi and Puthukkudiyiruppu. Those 
  settled in Killinochchi were once more displaced in late 1996. From October 
  1995, the LTTE recruited intensively from this displaced population, until most 
  of them progressively left the Vanni. <u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>In April last year (our Bulletin No. 
  20), on the Leader&#146;s orders intense propaganda activity and compulsory 
  self-defence training in schools and villages had commenced. A variety of pressures 
  were applied to ensure co-operation, including the withholding of government 
  rations. A certificate was issued at the end of the training lasting 3 months. 
  People were then checked on the roads, and those (both men and women) who could 
  not show the certificate were turned back. Life was so made difficult. Exit 
  visas were also refused to those who did not train.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>A new intensification of militarisation 
  and child recruitment commenced on 5<sup>th</sup> May 2000 with the &#145;Elephant 
  Pass Victory Festival&#146;. The LTTE has developed a system of punishments 
  forcing people and school children to attend festivals and protest demonstrations. 
  The slogan for the occasion was <i>&#145;The Leader Who Rules The World&#146;</i>.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The following figures drawn from a school in the area 
  of Mallavi, attended mainly by Vanni natives, gives an idea of the recruitment 
  of children (most of them 14 and 15 years) from this category: Before the April 
  1999 commencement of compulsory training - 4 joined; From April 1999 to early 
  2000 &#150;15 joined; 5<sup>th</sup> May 2000 to late June (7 weeks) &#150; 
  24 joined. This gives us an idea of the unprecedentedly severe methods of recruitment 
  being used at present which we will describe in the sequel.<u1:p></u1:p></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>We may also give a fairly informative idea of the life-span 
  of the young recruits. Of the 15 who joined between April 1999 and early 2000, 
  the bodies of six were brought to their school for display before being laid 
  to rest. This ceremony is intended to give the dead an aura of heroism and to 
  make the others guilty about not joining. But we reliably understand that a 
  total of 9 out of the 15 who joined had died in a little over an year.<u1:p></u1:p></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>The feelings of the parents of children 
  so killed are expressed guardedly and vanish into the sultry air. The mother 
  of a girl recruit who joined when she was 14 and was killed aged 15, was brought 
  to school. After seeing the remains of the girl, she told a neighbour, <i>&#147;I 
  lost my daughter when she was 14 and now they have taken my son who is of the 
  same age.&#148;</i> The son had joined after his elder sister was killed. A 
  clear sense of outrage was couched in her expression of sorrow. It is a common 
  reaction when an LTTE cadre is killed for a younger sibling to join.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>In another village a man facing hard 
  times, who once had means and was well-to-do, was seen standing, looking bent 
  and miserable. He told another who inquired<i>, &#147;My daughter (about 15) 
  has gone.&#148;</i> The lady asked him, <i>&#147;But were you not in great form, 
  being very busy and active, at the Elephant Pass victory festival?&#148;</i> 
  The man looked even more miserable and blurted out<i>, &#147;But they forced 
  me!&#148;</i> We will come to that later.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>Girls have been in a large majority 
  in the current round of recruitment in schools. 20 girls were recruited recently 
  from a school and were taken to a girls&#146; camp. They were ordered to surrender 
  their school uniforms and were given exercise slacks. The school uniforms were 
  burnt in their presence. After a day, five of the girls aged 14 to 15 told the 
  camp authorities that they wanted to go home. These girls were then isolated, 
  taken to a room, stripped, mercilessly assaulted and pushed onto the ground. 
  They were then trampled upon. This punitive violence was administered by senior 
  girls.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>The girls were then locked up. Three 
  of them escaped when they had the chance. The remaining two were too frightened 
  to escape. The escapees made it home after walking more than 24 hours in the 
  jungle. The father of one of the girls feared that the LTTE would come looking 
  for his daughter. He got hold of a jaw of a large shark &#150; a long object 
  with sharp teeth on it &#150; and was determined that should the LTTE come for 
  his daughter, he would fight them and face death at their hands. He continues 
  to keep her at home. This is one instance of the desperation which tens of thousands 
  of parents feel, but may not resort to such an extreme. We have it on good authority 
  that if the term voluntary recruitment has any meaning when applied to children, 
  only 5% go willingly.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>During the one and a half months following 5<sup>th</sup> 
  May, about 5% of the school children targetted have been recruited. Another 
  source of recruitment comes from orphans and destitutes brought up by the LTTE 
  in their &#145;Chencholai&#146; (Red&#150;Blossomed Garden) homes for children. 
  Here brainwashing and adulation of the Leader begins from the time they are 
  in (Our <a
href="..\Reports\Report13\Report13.htm">Report No. 13</a>). We have no estimate 
  of the number, but children as young ad 10 and 11 can be seen walking about 
  in LTTE uniform.<u1:p></u1:p></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The Red-Blossomed Garden homes are often referred 
  to as orphanages, but its inmates come from a variety of backgrounds. Some are 
  close relatives or siblings of dead LTTE cadre whose families had fallen on 
  difficult times. A particular group of recruits tells us something about the 
  motivation behind these homes and the social conditions that provide inmates. 
  Following the engineered Jaffna exodus of 1995, a number of displaced parents 
  in the Vanni got their children to beg. Many of these children were taken off 
  the streets by the LTTE, put into vans and were deposited in the Red-Blossomed 
  Garden.<u1:p></u1:p></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>In the homes they are graded into 
  categories and used accordingly. Some would study and get into universities. 
  Some do military-related work from a very early age. The incident below illustrates 
  the position of children in the RBG.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>A mother rendered destitute after displacement from 
  Jaffna in 1995, gave charge of her young son to the RBG. Late in 1998 a sealed 
  coffin that was said to contain the remains of her 13 year old son was brought 
  to the mother in Puthukkudiyiruppu. She screamed and wanted to break open the 
  coffin, but was prevented by LTTE guards. The child had been taken to an area 
  of fighting as a helper, and was killed in a shell blast.<u1:p></u1:p></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>Unlike in the earlier phases of fighting 
  where small arms played a dominant role, most of the young being killed on the 
  LTTE side (eg. Elephant Pass) are now brought home in sealed coffins as they 
  had been mangled by shelling. A large number - more than 1000 - were hospitalised 
  with grievous injuries.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>A question that strikes one immediately 
  is, how do parents allow their own children to be taken almost by force from 
  school without any organised protest?<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<h2><a name="_Toc515621871"><span lang=EN-GB>3. The Regime of Terror</span></a></h2>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB><u1:p></u1:p>The extent of repression 
  should not surprise someone with a historical perspective. It had begun by the 
  time the St.John&#146;s College principal Anandarajah was killed in June 1985 
  and was firmly in place by mid-1986. Why such a thorough campaign to exterminate 
  dissent by killing for example members of the some of the smaller left-oriented 
  groups who refused to co-operate with both the governments of India and Sri 
  Lanka, whom the LTTE would still dare not call traitors? It was to make the 
  people accept any degree of repression they thought fit to impose, according 
  to need. In Vanni today we are seeing its horrendous limits.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>One token of this repression is the 
  behaviour of parents when they hear that LTTE recruiters had come to their children&#146;s 
  school. Earlier (mid-90s) in Jaffna the parents would rush to the school and 
  surround it and the teachers and the principal would often help the parents 
  to safeguard their children. This pattern continued into the Vanni in 1996. 
  But in Vanni today the situation is different.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>Parents today do not rush to the school 
  in an organised manner when the recruiters arrive. At one time the teachers 
  and the principal used to insist on being present when the recruiters addressed 
  the children. Today as soon as the recruiters arrive the teachers walk out of 
  the class and there is no adult to witness the pressures being employed. Whatever 
  civil society there was in the Vanni has been destroyed and the people have 
  been reduced to zombies. One means used to accomplish this is direct terror. 
  What is more damagingly effective is indirect terror. A government official 
  is, say, given an order by the LTTE. At first it may be innocuous enough. He 
  agrees knowing at the back of his mind that the consequences of refusal may 
  be unpleasant. These orders progressively increase in their degree of unreasonableness 
  and the official goes all the way until he is thoroughly caught.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>When someone is more difficult, there 
  is direct intervention. A government official was for some time firm with the 
  Tigers about doing his job. Once he was taken away by the Tigers and given a 
  warning. No one knows what transpired. What people saw subsequently was a broken 
  man. When the LTTE addresses senior educationists, a casual warning is sometimes 
  issued: &#147;You know what happens to those who do not co-operate!&#148;</span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Teachers who try to protect the children from recruiters 
  are marked. One day a local LTTE leader may meet him alone and tell him, &#147;We 
  have reports that you are not co-operating with our recruitment drive.&#148; 
  Once when recruiters arrived in school, four young girls approached a teacher 
  and asked her, &#147;Miss, may we go home?&#148; The teacher replied, &#147;Now 
  that they have come, it is not nice for me to let you go. You listen to them. 
  If you are firm in your mind, they cannot do anything to you.&#148; Later 
  an angry recruiter approached the teacher and said, &#147;I hear you told some 
  of the students not to join our movement!&#148;<u1:p></u1:p></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Other direct and more extreme forms of terror exist 
  which are for ordinary people too unpleasant to contemplate. The people have 
  seen dozens of bodies of persons executed and dumped on the roadsides. In the 
  sizeable village of Puthukkudiyiruppu alone, people have seen about a hundred 
  of such bodies during 1998. The victim with eyes and mouth tied and hands tied 
  behind the back is brought to a public place and the people are summoned. The 
  charges are then read out by a cadre while the victim remains speechless. While 
  the charges are read, the spectators are also told, &#147;We are watching many 
  more persons, traders, farmers etc, who are doing similar things and we will 

  act against them soon.&#148; ( Some traders stopped trading out of fear.) A 
  pistol is then raised and a bullet fired into the forehead. The victim drops 
  lifeless. If the victim twitches, a second bullet is fired. The crowd goes away 
  horrified and skeptical.<u1:p></u1:p></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>Since 1999 these public executions 
  have been very much reduced. The reason attributed for it is concern being voiced 
  by human rights organisations such as Amnesty International. We understand that 
  now the LTTE has reverted back to secret executions as in the early 90s. By 
  the same token we have confirmation that a large number of detainees are being 
  held in bunkers, in chains. Testimony comes from civilian as well as LTTE detainees.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>A detainee in North-Vanni was later 
  given some freedom of movement within the premises. He had seen detainees in 
  chains, dishevelled and with faces covered, walking falteringly, led by guards. 
  This was a revelation to the detainee about the kind of cruelty involved. He 
  is also aware that nearby there were also Sri Lankan Army prisoners who were 
  quite free to play games such as foot-ball.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>LTTE cadre who wish to leave before 
  completing 7 years are chained and kept in a bunker for 6 months, even if they 
  have completed most of the period, had worked hard, and got injured fighting 
  for the LTTE. They are then given a period of manual labour before being released. 
  This has been another source of information through which we have been able 
  to confirm that a large number of civilians are kept chained in underground 
  bunkers.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>This shows a continuity with practices we had reported 
  in some detail in the early 90s (our reports <a href="..\Reports\Report5\Report5.htm">5</a>, 
  <a
href="../Reports/Report6/Report6.htm">6</a>, <a href="../Reports/Report8/Report8.htm">8</a>, 
  <a href="..\Reports\Report9\Report9.htm">9</a> &amp; <a
href="..\Reports\Report10\Report10.htm">10</a>, and <a href="bul5.htm">Bulletin 
  No.5</a>). The cumulative end-result is given eloquent testimony by some remarkable 
  happenings. In the past the LTTE allowed senior officials of the Sri Lankan 
  Government enough leeway to keep their self-respect. This has changed drastically. 
  Among those who under compulsion undergo military training now to serve in the 
  LTTE&#146;s Border Force are government officials having designations of Government 
  Agent, Assistant Government Agent, Director of Education and Assistant Commissioner 
  of Co-operatives. All these officials sign and pass on instructions dictated 
  by LTTE co-ordinators, such as Illankumaran for education. Orders to close government 
  offices at 3.00 PM on training days have been passed down by departmental heads. 
  Letters summoning employees to LTTE meetings refer in coded form to an &#145;urgent 
  discussion&#146;. What freedom can an individual have in this environment?<u1:p></u1:p></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>The absolute control of the government 
  machinery as we shall see enabled the LTTE to put into effect a far-reaching 
  system of repression. Firstly we deal with its implication for schools.<u1:p></u1:p></span><span lang=EN-GB><a href="#_Toc515621866">[Top]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="_Toc515621872"><span lang=EN-GB>4. How Universal Conscription Works</span></a></h2>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB><u1:p></u1:p>On 5<sup>th</sup> May, 
  after the Elephant Pass attack, the LTTE in effect told the schools that they 
  need not teach. Three days a week all school children from year 10 (grade 9) 
  upwards (that is the 14/15 age group and above) were required to take military 
  training.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>This is different from the former 
  self-defence training, but there was continuity. Last year school children were 
  marched with poles. But December last year saw a parade of schoolgirls in Mallavi. 
  Though not in uniform, guns had been substituted for poles, so that they were 
  unawares becoming soldiers. Now escape has been made nigh impossible. Within 
  one month the school children had been put through dismantling and reassembling 
  guns and grenades. They were then divided into two sides and mock battles were 
  held.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>The means used to ensure full attendance 
  is that those who do not train can neither attend school nor tutories. School 
  authorities have been asked to enforce this, causing them deep heart-burn and 
  misgivings. However children gradually stopped coming anyway. The reason was 
  not far to seek. The children train from 7.00 to 8.00 AM, go back home, bathe 
  and get to school at 9.00 AM. After that there are no lessons, instead, propaganda 
  full five days of the week &#150; 3 days by the LTTE propaganda wing and on 
  the other two days by teachers from other schools. When the LTTE arrive, those 
  in the smaller classes try to slip away home. On the streets too there are booths 
  of the Political Wing at short intervals to stop young and inveigle them in.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>When the LTTE come for classes, the 
  pattern is that there are guards posted outside the school and about three cadre 
  waiting with motorbikes. The recruiters pick out children individually and apply 
  psychological pressure on them to join. Often the child would try to buy time 
  by saying that she would come after, say, a temple festival a few days away. 
  In a particular case the child did not go for a month after the promised date. 
  The recruiter watched her and in a propaganda class asked another girl in class, 
  <i>&#147;This girl promised to come at a given time. We waited 5 days, 10 days 
  and now it is a month. Tell me, can this girl be forgiven or not?&#148;</i> 
  The girl questioned answered that it was unforgivable and felt miserable thereafter. 
  The first girl feeling helpless was in tears.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>As soon as a child is made to say 
  yes, he or she is immediately placed on a waiting motorbike and deposited at 
  a camp. Many of the new recruits were found crying when they were taken away. 
  Seeing the children being taken away crying, some villagers would purposely 
  ask the LTTE the reason for it. Normally they would get the reply, <i>&#147;They 
  were tears of joy&#148;</i>, or that <i>&#147;They were tears of parting (from 
  friends)&#148;</i>. Owing to this the parents took their children from schools 
  and sent them to tutories. At present the LTTE is not objecting to this provided 
  the children attended the military training sessions. They attend military training 
  and then the tutories in the hope that they could continue with their studies. 
  But here things are by no means certain.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>The A Level examinations are due in 
  August and the students are preparing at tutories. But the LTTE continues to 

  give mixed signals about whether it would permit the holding of A Levels. It 
  will decide after judging what it could get away with. We understand that there 
  are plans to subvert attempts by the students to continue with their studies, 
  while going for training solely to ward off the LTTE.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>We reliably understand that those 
  undergoing training are to be issued with identification plates to wear around 
  their neck and would be initially required to do 10 days of military service 
  a month in border areas. Ultimately it would dash their hopes of a future for 
  themselves as normal people, and would make them part of an organisation where 
  becoming a suicide bomber becomes the outlet for their despair. The LTTE has 
  already taken 50 A Level first year students each from some of the bigger central 
  schools to do 10 days on the border.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Programmes to get children in are now a regular feature. 
  A &#145;Students&#146; Inspirational Week&#146; was begun on 6<sup>th</sup> 
  June. An LTTE speaker told the school<i>, &#147;I too once thought studies are 
  important and put my heart and soul into it. I later realised that liberation 
  is far more important, so here I am&#148;.</i> He added that studies are now 
  not necessary until Eelam is obtained. The same things were said in all the 
  schools<u1:p></u1:p></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>In most schools now children attending 
  grade 10 and above are a small fraction of the number. They are frequently students 
  who are medically certified for ailments such as wheezing and rheumatism. The 
  56 year old right in this country of compulsory free education for all, has 
  been turned into a pretext for conscription.<u1:p></u1:p></span><span lang=EN-GB><a href="#_Toc515621866">[Top]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="_Toc515621873"><span lang=EN-GB>5. Current LTTE Policy Towards Child 
  Recruitment</span></a></h2>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB><u1:p></u1:p>Child recruitment from 
  the age of ten upwards (then nearly all males) was practised by the LTTE openly 
  in the early 90s. With the government administration in the North coming under 
  its control and its social and psychological mechanisms for recruitment becoming 
  more effective, there was a shift towards combat effectiveness and generally 
  the preferred age became 15 or 16, while not spurning much younger recruits. 
  During mid-1998 the UN special envoy<b>, Mr.Olara Otunnu</b>, who was dealing 
  with the subject of child soldiers, visited Sri Lanka. The LTTE pledged to him 
  that they would not recruit those below 17 and not use those below 18 in combat.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>But the LTTE had placed itself in 
  a position where it could not negotiate for a political settlement, and its 
  whole thrust was towards militarily establishing a separate state. It began 
  the first of its conventional thrusts by taking Killinochchi in October 1998 
  and with it started a massive recruitment campaign. The pressure applied on 
  children grew in intensity. Any token attempt to keep the agreement with <b>Otunnu</b> 
  was forgotten.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>A further conventional attack in early 
  November 1999 caused the Army to lose large tracts of territory in what the 
  LTTE leader called the first phase of &#145;Unceasing Waves&#146;. On National 
  Heroes Day, 27<sup>th</sup> November 1999, the leader declared the coming year 
  to be the Year of Battles that would see the establishment of his separate state. 
  He had given priority to retaking the Jaffna peninsula. In December he made 
  important strategic gains on the east coast of the Jaffna peninsula, but failed. 
  The Government remained unbelievably complacent. In April 2000 he came very 
  close to success, but failed beyond capturing more territory. This was a serious 
  setback for his plans.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>The whole exercise from December had 
  cost the LTTE about 1,500 dead and many more injured. This was in an organisation 
  whose total strength was generally placed at 7,000, but placed higher by local 
  observers. The LTTE&#146;s problem was not arms and money, of which its global 
  reach provided more than enough. It needed considerably more recruits to make 
  another attempt at taking Jaffna. This comes out clearly in its propaganda meetings.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>Currently these meetings held for 
  the public, schoolteachers and government officials are being addressed by big 
  guns. They include Balakumar and Para who were EROS leaders, Thamil Chelvan 
  who heads the LTTE Political Wing, Vithuran and Puthuvai Rathinathurai, a former 
  communist and poet laureate. Their constant message is that they can take Jaffna 
  in a few days or even a few hours (Puthuvai), but they need 2000 more people. 
  Balakumar and Para have been taken off their normal duties and specially assigned 
  to recruitment. <b>Even mature people listening to these recruitment speeches 
  said that they get so emotionally carried away that they develop goose-pimples. 
  Later, it is like coming out of a trance.<u1:p></u1:p></b></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Reflected in ground reality, it means that any consideration 
  for age of recruitment is not observed. All that matters is whether the boy 
  or girl can carry a gun. Although compulsory training begins at grade 9, those 
  who are bigger made from the lower classes are also picked out and asked to 
  join those doing military training. A recruiter going over a class would often 
  pick out someone and say something like, &#147;You would do fine to man the 
  cannon.&#148; When a child is taken, only appeals from the parents are tokenly 
  entertained. An uncle, aunt or any other relative is rudely chased away. In 
  one incident the father and the mother of a child had barged into an LTTE camp. 
  They were beaten and chased away for trespass. This also reflects a desperation 
  about wanting to take Jaffna.<u1:p></u1:p><span lang=EN-GB><a href="#_Toc515621866">[Top]</a></span></p>
<h3><a name="_Toc515621874"><span lang=EN-GB>6. Why Take Jaffna?<u1:p></u1:p></span></a><span lang=EN-GB></span></h3>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>Jaffna has prestige value as having 

  been the intellectual centre of the Tamils and also the fountainhead of Tamil 
  nationalism. After being under the control of the LTTE, Jaffna folk had also 
  shown considerable reservations about the LTTE to its embarrassment. However 
  the LTTE&#146;s immediate need to take Jaffna is mundane - i.e. flesh and muscle.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Although the East has been the main traditional source 
  of recruitment, forming the bulk of the casualties, this dropped temporarily 
  from 1992 when the Army took control of most parts of the East. In the Pooneryn 
  attack in 1993, Jaffna recruits dominated the casualties. After the Army took 
  Jaffna in 1995, schools functioned normally and recruitment by the LTTE in Jaffna 
  dropped to almost zero. This was resented by the other cadre, especially from 
  the East, who again began dominating casualty lists of the LTTE&#146;s very 
  costly conventional campaigns from 1998. Moreover, recruitment in the Vanni 
  and the LTTE-controlled East with a total population base of about 300,0000, 
  was being pushed to the limit and can be increased only by cannibalising any 
  remaining social structures as is being done in the Vanni now. However the capture 
  of Jaffna would not end the LTTE leader&#146;s task.<u1:p></u1:p></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>But taking Jaffna would increase the 
  LTTE&#146;s population base by 500,000. The Leader would then have to use in 
  Jaffna the harsh methods of recruitment he has used elsewhere as a sop to satisfy 
  the longsuffering people in the Vanni and especially Batticaloa. He would moreover 
  need these Jaffna recruits to launch the final thrust to liberate South Tamil 
  Eelam &#150; the East. This would be very difficult because of the long border 
  with the populous South. It is something for which he has been preparing from 
  the time he attacked Mullaitivu and captured long-range cannon in 1996 and has 
  not deviated from it and he cannot.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>Now that taking Jaffna has proved 
  more difficult, he has to go for broke in the Vanni, break every sense of community, 
  all human values and all fundamental loyalties to make everyone who can physically 
  carry a gun a fighter. It is the gamble of a desperate man who is throwing in 
  everything. Should he succeed, it would be the end of civilised life in Sri 
  Lanka. The country will not be able to absorb the consequences.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The reasons why the LTTE went all out in support of 
  the UNP presidential candidate Ranil Wickremasinghe in December 1999 are far 
  deeper than the rhetoric about Chandrika Kumaratunge having betrayed the Tamils. 
  As president he was pledged to give in effect the LTTE the North-East administration 
  on an interim basis. There is no need to expand on the consequences. It is 
  a matter of deep regret that some prominent NGOs in Colombo and some supposedly 
  anti-racist intellectuals were either backing the UNP or were saying that it 
  is what the Tamil people and those in Jaffna wanted - hence the need to utterly 
  discredit the Jaffna poll.<u1:p></u1:p></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>Of course those in Jaffna knew that 
  a UNP victory or a return of the LTTE would have apocalyptic consequences. This 
  was evident from last December when the LTTE made some incursions near Elephant 
  Pass. From Iyakkachchi 67 families were transported to the Vanni. They were 
  then visited by international NGOs, but they did not utter a word of complaint. 
  We do know for a fact that they did not want to move, but several of them were 
  assaulted and the families were transported forcibly. It is a pity that when 
  highly organised international institutions approach the ordinary people, the 
  truth which all the locals know, fails to surface.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>This phenomenon was in evidence again 
  in April and May. We have received several reports that thousands of people 
  in the Thenmaratchy caught up in areas where there was fighting between the 
  LTTE and the Army fled behind Army lines. Often on their way they were assaulted 

  by LTTE cadre. An estimated 2000 people, including injured civilians, were made 
  to get into trailers and after a drive were taken across a narrow stretch of 
  the sea near Pooneryn to the LTTE controlled Vanni. There can be no doubt as 
  to what nearly 100% of these people wanted. In early 1996 they had already defied 
  the LTTE&#146;s orders to move to the Vanni. Quite apart from what they thought 
  of the Army, there was a preferred option &#150; an option where their children 
  could attend school without being importuned by recruiters.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>The LTTE itself is very clear that 
  their reasons for taking Jaffna have nothing to do with the people there wanting 
  to be liberated from the Army. Some LTTE spokesmen display their hostility and 
  paranoia concerning people in Jaffna quite openly at public meetings in the 
  Vanni. One asked, &#147;<i>Whenever our cadre go to a place in Jaffna, they 
  are immediately surrounded by the Army. How do you think that happens?&#148;<u1:p></u1:p></i></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>Frequently when a group of corpses 
  of dead cadre are brought from Jaffna, the press and radio announcements would 
  say that they died in action. But at the local funerals, the people would be 
  told,<i> &#147;They were betrayed!&#148;</i></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>Other speakers have tried to express 
  it more humorously. They said in an oft repeated story: &#147;Once our cadre 
  went to the house of a retired principal in Jaffna, and knocked on the door. 
  Opening the door and recognising our boys, he invited them inside. A sumptuous 
  meal with pittu and several curries was on the table. He invited them to partake 
  of it. The LTTE men declined, went away and stayed at a distance. A little later 
  they saw a party of the Sri Lankan Army, led by the brigadier, going into the 
  principal&#146;s house. It was then they realised that they had stumbled into 
  a dinner prepared for the Army.&#148;<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>Puthuvai Rathinathurai said in another 
  story: &#147;During the operation to capture Elephant Pass, our cadre moved 
  into Vadamaratchy East near Nagar Kovil. An angry young woman came at them shouting, 
  &#147;I was going to marry the army captain tomorrow and now you have come and 
  spoilt everything&#148;. From the audience someone asked, &#147;Did they shoot 
  her?&#148; Rathinathurai assured them that she was spared.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>A senior leader related a story about 
  a woman from Jaffna who had been injured during the fighting between the Army 
  and the LTTE during May. The LTTE is said to have transported her and admitted 
  her to Mallavi hospital in the Vanni. When she regained consciousness some days 
  later, she asked where she was. When Mallavi was mentioned, she exclaimed<i>, 
  &#147;How on earth am I to get a pass to get back to Jaffna?&#148;</i><u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>The LTTE is very strict in issuing 
  passes to people who want to leave the Vanni, especially to children and others 
  eligible to be called up for military service. What the senior leader evidently 
  tried to convey was the unbecoming nature of people worrying about getting passes 
  to quit the Vanni at a time when the liberation struggle had reached a crucial 
  stage. It was when the audience taking a different meaning laughed heartily, 
  that the leader realised he had goofed.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>We have verified in general and in 
  particular cases that families in Jaffna caught up in the fighting (eg. Mattuvil) 
  were forcibly dispatched to the Vanni, and are settled in out-of-the-way places 
  such as in the Mullaitivu District. Subsequently their homes were looted as 
  happened during the Jaffna exodus in Valikamam. Several of their houses were 
  also destroyed or damaged by Kfir bombers and shells. In many cases people sent 
  to the Vanni want to get to their relatives or are seeking proper medical care, 
  as in the case of the elderly, but are finding passes difficult. Several of 
  the injured taken to the Vanni were later admitted to Vavuniya Hospital.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>In the Vanni itself after every displacement, 
  the people become desperately poor and the LTTE richer. The LTTE has acquired 
  a giant cattle-herd.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>In 1990 the LTTE had ordered the EROS 
  to close down and formally become part of the LTTE. Balakumar, now a key LTTE 
  propagandist, agreed abjectly, angering many EROS members who then left. Balakumar 
  did not have the nerve for the kind of risks taken by Prabhakaran and thought 
  it very foolish when Prabhakaran attacked the Indian Army in 1987. One aspect 

  of his nature is that when under training in India in the mid-80s, he used to 
  be seen crying, longing to be with his father and mother. He was then in his 
  mid-30s.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>It is now his job to take even very 
  young children from their parents and send them to almost certain death. However, 
  unlike Prabhakaran, he knows that controlling Jaffna would be an unpleasant 
  task. When questioned he could sometimes be disarmingly frank. After saying 
  that they would somehow take Jaffna, he threw up his hands and confessed, <i>&#147;After 
  that we don&#146;t know what we are going to do!&#148;<u1:p></u1:p></i></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>Such anxieties do not bother Prabhakaran. 
  The past record suggests that if he needs to kill thousands of people in Jaffna 
  to bring Jaffna down to the level of servility now obtaining in the Vanni, he 
  would not hesitate to do it. He made up his mind a long time ago that he would 
  not balk at going to the lowest depths to achieve his Eelam.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>Some military and political analysts 
  viewed the prospective fall of Jaffna last May as a military setback. Several 
  peace activists, liberals and the UNP leader saw giving the LTTE control over 
  Jaffna as a confidence-building measure. What callous indifference parading 
  as wisdom! How well-founded are their theories about peace?<u1:p></u1:p></span><span lang=EN-GB><a href="#_Toc515621866">[Top]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="_Toc515621875"><span lang=EN-GB>7. How Serious is the LTTE About 
  Peace?</span></a></h2>
<p><span lang=EN-GB><u1:p></u1:p>We have answered this question before and history 
  and the contents of LTTE journals speak for themselves. At a recent meeting 
  a senior LTTE leader was asked about Norwegian mediation. He replied that the 
  Norwegians, like beneficent gods, came here with sincere intentions of bringing 
  peace, and added that the Norwegians had begun to go rotten after they started 
  going to New Delhi and consulting India. He later said that they are aiming 
  high at Tamil Eelam and whatever they have to do on the way there is a small 
  matter.</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-GB><u1:p></u1:p>Someone pointed out that the Leader himself had 
  said publicly that they are ready for peace talks. The senior leader replied 
  that such pronouncements are <i>&#145;maya jala vitthai&#146;</i> (hocus pocus, 
  or trickery). An old man then asked, <i>&#147;Do you mean to say that our Thalaivar 
  (Leader) is a liar?&#148;</i> The senior leader looked disturbed and waffled.</span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB><u1:p></u1:p>A total and universally 

  destructive war has thus become a substitute for the inability to talk peace. 
  To this end we mentioned that the control of the population is accomplished 
  in part through the control of basic services that are provided by the government 
  machinery.<u1:p></u1:p></span><span lang=EN-GB><a href="#_Toc515621866">[Top]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="_Toc515621876"><span lang=EN-GB>8. Control of the Government Machinery</span></a></h2>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB><u1:p></u1:p>One aspect of it is the 
  doctoring of records and the illegal transfer of resources. For example the 
  monies allocated by provincial ministries for public works are fully spent regardless 
  of whether or not the work is done. This is relatively of minor significance. 
  But when orders from the LTTE are rubber stamped down the line, so that the 
  LTTE can decide who will get government rations that are an entitlement and 
  who will not, here we have something with far-reaching consequences. Village 
  headmen are also used to extract supposedly voluntary payments for the many 
  LTTE funds as a condition for collecting their government rations.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>Even more serious is that of pilfering 

  rations to keep people on the brink of starvation, thus making them vulnerable 
  to being roped in for military service. Government rations do get late at times 
  when there is fighting, but they eventually arrive. It is only in Madhu refugee 
  camp that people get their full rations. But outside they may receive about 
  half. If say rations failed to come during a month, the next month they may 
  receive a month&#146;s rations when two months&#146; rations have been made 
  available. If the full government rations are passed on, the recipients may 
  not get balanced food, but they will not starve.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>When it comes to promotions or recommendations for 
  promotions, orders are given to heads by LTTE co-ordinators. Thus sycophancy 
  gets priority over merit, seniority and eligibility, in some ways replicating 
  the system in the South. In particular cases those who are good at recommending 
  themselves to the LTTE are equally good at recommending themselves to the Government.</p>
<u1:p></u1:p> 
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>In the educational field, one way 
  of going up the ranks of government service from an LTTE controlled area is 
  to be very co-operative in abetting LTTE activities, including child recruitment<u1:p></u1:p>

<h2><a name="_Toc515621877"><span lang=EN-GB>9. Teachers &amp; Recruitment</span></a></h2>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB><u1:p></u1:p>Once intense recruitment 
  began on 5<sup>th</sup> May, the teachers were summoned and ordered to take 
  propaganda sessions twice a weak in a school other than their own. On the other 
  three days LTTE teams went to the schools, and for special meetings, several 
  schools came together. The teachers were asked to speak on &#145;current affairs&#146; 
  To this end teachers were given classes on orders passed through the government 
  educational authorities about once in 20 days. About once a month the teachers 
  were expected to organise the students and put up inspirational dramas to aid 
  recruitment.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>The syllabus, as it were, of the propaganda 
  sessions was an inversion of traditional history &#150; the Duttugemunu-Elara 
  episode for example &#150; taught in Sri Lankan schools, and its authors were 
  people like Balakumar. According to this, some alien nations, starting with 
  the Portuguese, had sundered the Tamil nation by continuously having an army 
  camp at Elephant Pass for 560 years. By demolishing it the LTTE had achieved 
  a victory unprecedented in the annals of mankind. <u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>Another topic in current affairs which 
  they are supposed to teach is the sea-landing in April of 1400 cadre north of 
  Elephant Pass on the east coast of the peninsula. This was said to be even more 
  remarkable than some of the military feats during the Second World War. Most 
  teachers in the Vanni are unhappy with being forced to do propaganda and do 
  the bare minimum. When LTTE men come snooping around while a session is going 
  on, a teacher unenthusiastically doing the minimum may raise his voice and say, 
  <i>&#147;In the whole history of the world there has not been a leader so great 
  as our Leader!&#148;<u1:p></u1:p></i></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>The authority of the teachers is also 
  continuously undermined. As mentioned earlier, when LTTE recruitment teams arrive, 
  teachers simply quit the class. When students seek permission from the teacher 
  to go out of the school or to fetch some water, the LTTE would tell them, <i>&#147;Your 
  teacher is a nobody here. If we ask your teachers to go, they go, if we ask 
  them to come, they come, if we ask them to stand on their head, they stand on 
  their head.&#148;<u1:p></u1:p></i></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>Most teachers feel miserable and utterly 
  humiliated. Instead of discharging their traditional responsibility of teaching, 
  guiding and protecting their children, they are forced to connive at tricking 
  them into going to their death. For the most part they are forced to while away 
  their time and collect their salary. There is also a strong feeling of guilt, 
  where many feel that the right thing to do is to resign their job and farm.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>To a question at a meeting, how long 
  the military training of students would go on (the earlier self-defence training 
  was of limited duration), an LTTE functionary replied<b>, &#147;Once all the 
  students join our organisation, there will be no need for further training.&#148;</b> 
  The intention is clear.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>What is happening in schools is part 
  of a larger process where the whole community is forced to connive at the sacrifice 
  of children.</span><span lang=EN-GB><a href="#_Toc515621866">[Top]</a></span><span lang=EN-GB><u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<h2><a name="_Toc515621878"><span lang=EN-GB>10. The Art of 100% Support<u1:p></u1:p></span></a><span lang=EN-GB></span></h2>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>About four videos are made in the Vanni every month 
  showing large numbers of people holding placards, protesting against the Government 
  on some issue or showing their support for the Tigers. But in reality the people 
  are forced to come for these or suffer some disability. Unless the demonstration 
  is particularly to do with schools, the students are asked to change and come 
  in civilian clothes. Once the people come, they are given the slogans written 
  on placards in English and Tamil to be carried. When occasion demands, they 
  are also given pictures of the Leader. A cassock here and there gives the occasion 
  added authenticity.<u1:p></u1:p></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>The videos taken are dispatched to 
  the West as part of fund raising efforts. Subjects of protest include the Government&#146;s 
  failure to dispatch rice rations, medicines, school books, school uniforms, 
  its alleged attempt to starve the people and so on. The truth is that there 
  may be delays according to the ground situation, but the goods do arrive. There 
  have been occasions when a protest was organised, the goods arrived routinely 
  and the LTTE claimed credit. Normally the government departments know when the 
  goods are on the way.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>When a demonstration is announced, 
  people try to make excuses - some urgent business in the field, a sick cow and 
  so on. Here the government machinery is part of the means of enforcing compliance, 
  ensuring that at least two from every family attend. The village headman to 
  whom the people have to go for rations, identity cards and so on, has been given 
  the task of enforcing attendance. <b>This has led to ironies such as family 
  being denied food rations for failing to attend a protest demonstration accusing 
  the Government of starving people by not sending rations.<u1:p></u1:p></b></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>We earlier encountered a man who was 
  very active in the Elephant Pass victory festival and was later miserable when 
  his young daughter joined the LTTE. He said that his role at the festival was 
  forced on him. Elaborating, he added that since he had been a man of influence, 
  the headman had asked him to bring a given number of people to the festival. 
  He pointed out that should he have declined, the headman can harass him in so 
  many ways, including delaying signing various documents such as applications 
  for identity cards. Even if it was not the whole truth, it shows how the system 
  works. The headman is ordered to bring a certain number of people and he passes 
  it down.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Normally departmental heads and school principals are 
  given quotas of persons to present at an occasion. Some are indifferent while 
  others try to bring double their quota. These village headmen or principals 
  make it a point to impress on the LTTE that they have done more than their due. 
  The LTTE would announce who did more and who has been slack, so applying pressure 
  on the latter.<u1:p></u1:p></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>It is a system where people are asked 
  to put away their humanity and intelligence and behave as morons. Those who 
  apply for passes to make a trip out of the Vanni are treated as criminals. As 
  they are questioned in the pass office, intelligence men snoop around occasionally 
  popping a question. At the end of the experience most people feel a loss of 
  personality.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>A further elaboration is the queuing 
  at the exit point from the Vanni at Pandivirichchan. The people are forced to 
  queue in a narrow channel bounded on either side by bladed wire taken from the 
  Army&#146;s abandoned defence lines.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>After years of this, it is not hard 
  to imagine why people have stopped surrounding schools <i>en masse</i> when 
  recruiters go there to take their children. The system has gone further in its 
  attempts to militarise the whole society.<u1:p></u1:p></span><span lang=EN-GB><a href="#_Toc515621866">[Top]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="_Toc515621879"><span lang=EN-GB>11. The Border Force<u1:p></u1:p></span></a><span lang=EN-GB></span></h2>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>All civilians from the ages of 16 
  to 45 are required to undergo similar military training as in schools, for the 
  Border Force. Indirectly it has made total minions even of high ranking officers 
  paid by the Government. Those above that age are drawn into the Village Force. 
  The function of the latter is to do jobs like the repairing of roads for which 
  the Government (eg. Provincial Council) has allocated money. The LTTE pockets 
  the money.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>The Border Force is at present posted 
  in frontier areas either in a defensive capacity or in ordnance work. Since 
  April this year 30 to 50 Border Force personnel are said to have been killed 
  - mostly in Jaffna. They were no more than civilians carrying a gun under duress. 
  Their families were totally unprepared for their deaths.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>In the Mulangavil area in the Killinochchi 
  District, a middle aged man was taken north for border duty. When the wife received 
  news that the man had been killed, she and her four children took poison and 
  committed suicide. Another man in the same area was similarly taken north and 
  his wife had no news of him for many days. When the man returned home, he found 
  that his wife and children had ended their life.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>For the families of the Border Force 
  dead who lived on, life was not going to be easy. Even earlier they had lived 
  in poverty. They were entitled to a compensation of Rs 25,000. This is what 
  the Government pays widows of victims killed by the security forces</span>, 
  and at current prices this sum would soon be exhausted. A particular phenomenon 
  that has accompanied Border Force training is the use of sequestered grenades 
  in murder. There are said to have been six such incidents. In two of the cases 
  at Oddisuddan and Mulliavalai, the LTTE has administered capital punishment.<u1:p></u1:p></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>In the Vanni too a significant number 
  of civilians have died or lost their limbs through bombing and shelling by the 
  security forces. A group of very articulate persons who live in the Vanni and 
  know what is going on are the Christian clergy, particularly from the Roman 
  Catholic Church. Many of them would say little. But the others would play down 
  the extent of the LTTE&#146;s repression, would deny that coercion is used to 
  recruit children, and would make a case that what the LTTE does is justified 
  by the callousness of the Government. 21 civilians were killed when Air Force 
  bombs fell in Puthukkudiyiruppu market last September. (The Government first 
  tried to deny it, but no inquiry has been held.) They would also cite suffering 
  caused by restrictions on goods placed by the Government, and the starving of 
  civilians to enhance their case.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>We merely observe that the people 
  living in the Vanni have a fairly sober assessment of the Government and its 
  limitations. But they have grave reservations about the track along which the 
  LTTE has been goading them and know that the world offers them far kinder options 
  than the blood sacrifice of their children and the destruction of their humanity.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>They are also grieved by the manner 
  in which they have been systematically misrepresented by those who speak on 
  their behalf, and in doing so condemn them to their present state. Unfortunately, 
  the Church is very guilty in this respect.<u1:p></u1:p></span><span lang=EN-GB><a href="#_Toc515621866">[Top]</a></span></p>

  &amp; Fascism<u1:p></u1:p></span></a><span
lang=EN-GB></span></h2>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>From the point of its global reach 
  the LTTE realised the importance of the churches when it became a state-in-the 
  making. But bishops of the powerful Roman Catholic Church have generally tried 
  to keep a distance. Bishop Rayappu Joseph of Mannar sometimes slips by treading 
  areas he should have avoided. During mid-June, Ananthi of the BBC Tamil Service 
  asked him a leading question about where the civilians in Jaffna caught up in 
  the presently LTTE controlled area would go if given a choice. The Bishop immediately 
  replied that they would come to the Vanni.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>Because of confusion in standing up 
  for values and a lack of courage in the Church hierarchy, through a handful 
  of priests the LTTE has been able to push the Church to support its propaganda. 
  There was in recent months a remarkable occasion in Killinochchi. The LTTE invited 
  a large number of priests and nuns for a meal. It turned out to be a perfect 
  western meal where several courses were served, with the best chinaware and 
  cutlery in use. At the end of the meal Thamil Chelvan read out a message from 
  the Leader.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>The message was that the Church has 
  an important role to play in obtaining legitimacy for their cause internationally. 
  There was also an earnest plea for their co-operation. The propaganda role of 
  the Church is important both locally as well as among the Tamil expatriate community. 
  Fr.P2 is the Mankulam correspondent of the Tamil service of the Philippines-based 
  Radio Veritas. Although owned by the Roman Catholic Church, it is notorious 
  for pro-LTTE propaganda.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The north of the Vanni comes under the Bishop of Jaffna 
  and during the middle of last year the Vanni Divine Service Council, consisting 
  of clergy and lay was in conference for 7 days. The president of the Council 
  was <b>Fr.P1</b>, <b>Fr.P2</b> its secretary and <b>Fr. P3</b> its co-ordinator. 
  On the last day <b>P1</b> brought up an item not on the agenda. He wanted the 
  Council to discuss, <i>&#147;What is the role of the Church and its contribution 
  in today&#146;s situation?&#148;</i></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>There was an attempt to steer the 
  discussion towards open support for the LTTE. The majority of the clergy and 
  other delegates were dumbfounded. </span>However they strongly objected and 
  the attempt to pass a pro-LTTE resolution failed.<u1:p></u1:p></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>It was rather resolved that the Government 
  and the LTTE should talk and bring about peace. But the next day the LTTE daily 
  <b><i>Eelanatham</i></b> announced that the Council had resolved to support 
  fully all the wartime measures of the LTTE. The same claim had also been quickly 
  given to the BBC Tamil Service and was broadcast. Although many priests protested 
  privately and the church authorities too later took the three officiating priests 
  to task, no correction was ever made.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>We said in our last bulletin that 
  the Church believed that the shells which killed 38 refugees in Madhu in November 
  1999 had been fired by the LTTE. We now have confirmation that this is widely 
  shared by church officials in Madhu and technically the Army could hardly have 
  fired those shells. We also learn that shortly after the incident, Bishop Joseph 
  Rayappu gave Karikalan, a senior LTTE figure, a dressing down. It was <b>Fr.P1</b> 
  who had told the BBC Tamil Service that the Army had fired the shells.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>The Church has however been silent, 
  allowing the people to believe that the Army fired the shells. Two months later 
  the <b>HUDEC</b> of the Roman Catholic Church in Jaffna organised a memorial 
  service for the victims at Madhu. However, the prayers and speeches, mostly 
  by laymen, referred to the victims as having been killed by <i>&#145;alien forces&#146;</i>. 
  That claim went uncorrected.<u1:p></u1:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><b><span
lang=EN-GB>Fr.P2</span></b><span lang=EN-GB> also chairs the NGO consortium for

<h2><a name="_Toc515621881"><span lang=EN-GB>13. On the Threshold of Tragedy<u1:p></u1:p></span></a><span lang=EN-GB></span></h2>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The LTTE is fated to persist its attempt to take Jaffna 
  as part of its long-term military plans. It will be very bitterly fought and, 
  on the LTTE&#146;s part, it is going to be a massacre of innocents, often taken 
  away in tears from their school. It is a tragedy in the making under our very 
  noses, and those who should be alerting the world to apply every available means 
  of pressure on the LTTE to stop this crime against children and against the 
  community as a whole, do not seem to be aware of the enormity of it. The confusion 
  of the West is also reflected in the presumption of <i>&#145;neutrality&#146;</i>. 
  Does one need to seek an artificial balance by supposing that children in the 
  Vanni are joining the LTTE because of Sri Lankan Air Force bombing? <u1:p></u1:p></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Many observers tend to avoid seeing the underlying 
  trends and look at issues very superficially.<u1:p></u1:p></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Are they equal to the well-camouflaged deception all 
  around them, and the controlled information that is channelled to them by a 
  very sophisticated organisation? <u1:p></u1:p></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>It is also important to recognise the effect of scores 
  of millions of dollars pouring into LTTE coffers from the West during this year 
  alone. Children have to be found to carry the weapons bought from this money.<u1:p></u1:p></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>When challenged, LTTE fund raisers in the West claim 
  that these millions are being collected for refugees in the Vanni. Has this 
  ever been challenged? Is there anything in the Vanni to justify this claim? 
  Has one dollar been spent paying compensation to the widow of a Border Force 
  victim? <b>The first step in halting the tragedy that threatens to engulf thousands 
  of children is to come to terms with what is really going on in the Vanni.</b></p>
<u1:p></u1:p> 
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>A number of groups in the South who supported justice 
  for Tamils in the past are today guilty of creating confusion about the interests 
  of the Tamil people. They have made it seem natural that the Tamil people want 
  to live under the LTTE, and that its attempt to take Jaffna is in keeping with 
  the wishes of the Tamil people. It is as though the Tamil people in the North-East 
  have an obsession for destroying their children. The LTTE taking Jaffna would 
  have been an act of brigandage and that is how it would have been seen in Jaffna. 
  It would have been very wrong to misrepresent a triumph of barbarism as a triumph 
  of nationalism.<u1:p></u1:p></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The Government too has failed to ask itself the many 
  questions that fall of Elephant Pass and the succeeding events should have raised. 
  The events have been looked at largely from a military stand-point. The civilian 
  perspective has been lost sight of. After the Army took Jaffna in 1996, these 
  civilians lived under guarantees and promises made by the Government. Thousands 
  of these civilians were last May caught up amidst Air Force bombing, and shelling 
  by both sides, when the Army&#146;s positions had to be protected. Why this 
  situation was allowed to arise needs to be answered. It is more than about the 
  destruction of dozens of lives and many homes. There are also political questions 
  of confidence and morale. The Army Commander has tried to place the onus on 
  the Jaffna civilians by suggesting that they should co-operate with the Army, 
  of which the LTTE thinks they are doing too much. That is not where the problem 
  lies. The LTTE gave the Army all the information they needed in the &#145; Liberation 
  Tigers&#146; of Jan-Feb 2000!<u1:p></u1:p></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>This is not going to be the last time and military 
  structures are in need of drastic repair, both to improve professionalism, give 
  confidence to the men and to uphold human rights - particularly in the areas 
  of torture and accountability after incidents, such as that in Batticaloa on 
  Vesak Day. Can this be accomplished by a Deputy Defence Minister whose main 
  recent preoccupation has been towards salvaging his personal reputation?<u1:p></u1:p></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>There is also a painful dilemma facing the Tamil intellectuals, 
  the Church in the North-East and the Tamil parties who with ill-disguised fear 
  have abdicated any role in finding a political solution to the LTTE. The LTTE 
  which has been culling the abler and effective members in their ranks, is goading 
  them in a particular direction. This direction is the &#145;EROS Way&#146;. 
  It is a dead end without honour. After launching out on a liberation struggle, 
  EROS leaders Balakumar and Para are now catching children for the LTTE. They 
  would privately admit to close friends that they have to go on because they 
  are trapped.<u1:p></u1:p></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Theirs is survival politics. Being politically astute 
  they know that the political vacuousness of the LTTE would lead the Tamil people 
  towards tragedy. In a frank moment Balakumar would throw up his hands and say, 
  &#147;<i>We will get Eelam, but then we don&#146;t know what to do</i>.&#148; 
  As Minister of Justice in the Vanni, Para&#146;s main job is to raise money 
  through astronomical fines, such as by levying impossible fines on widows who 
  buy Sri Lankan arrack at a highly inflated price from the LTTE, and sell it 
  for a small profit. Where children in the Vanni are concerned, most of the articulate 
  members of the Tamil community have been playing the EROS game.<u1:p></u1:p></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>At an age when we are talking about global governance, 
  are systems so weak, ineffective and blind, that nothing can be done to halt 
  the tragedy to which the children in the Vanni are being destined?<u1:p><span lang=EN-GB><a href="#_Toc515621866">[Top]</a></span></u1:p></p>
