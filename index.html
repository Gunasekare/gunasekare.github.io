						literature in SL and this is my attempt to gather details on the works that have been awarded
						with
						the State Literary Award since 1959. The

							List of Gratiaen Prize Winners & Short Listed Writers (1993-2019).</a> The Gratiaen Trust
						was
						founded in 1992
						by Michael Ondaatje, the internationally renowned novelist, poet and essayist of Sri Lankan
						origin.
						Funded with his Booker prize money for his novel <i>The English Patient</i>, Michael Ondaatje’s
						vision
						was to
						establish a Trust that would recognize and promote creative writing in English by Sri Lankan
						authors. Towards this the Gratiaen Prize, to be awarded annually, was established in
						1993 and is awarded for
						the best work of creative writing in English by a Sri Lankan citizen resident in Sri Lanka.</p>

				<li>
					<p><a href="https://keepass.info/" target="_blank">KeePass</a> is the password manager that I have
						been using for many
						number of years on my Windows PC to store passwords, recovery codes, key files etc. I use it in
						conjunction
						with the KeeAnywhere plugin (available on the KeePass website) to store the encrypted password
						database
						on cloud storage so that I
						can use the password information seamlessly on my Android device.</p>

					<p><a href="https://signal.org/download/">Signal</a> is my go-to secure messaging application.
						Primarily,
						the app
						is easy to use, has a clean UI, has end-to-end encryption by default for all conversations,
						does not collect data on its users, is open-source and requires less permissions to run.</p>

					<p>My current browser is <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">Mozilla Firefox</a>
						after
						migrating from Google Chrome due to privacy issues. So far I'm loving it (a close competitor was
						the <a href="https://brave.com/">
							Brave</a> browser)! I use Firefox with <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a> as
						the default search engine and with the
						extensions <a href="https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock">uBlock Origin</a> (ad-blocking),
						<a href="https://add0n.com/privacy-settings.html">Privacy Settings</a> (privacy related settings
						management),
						<a href="https://decentraleyes.org/">Decentraleyes</a> (for secure content delivery),
						<a href="https://www.mailvelope.com/en">Mailvelope</a> (encryption for common webmail, for
						example Gmail), and
						<a href="https://mybrowseraddon.com/change-timezone.html">Change Timezone/Time Shift</a> (to fix
						the time displayed on the browser,
						which usually breaks when the browser is made resistant to fingerprinting).
