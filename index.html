						I have long observed that there is no centralized document or database of award-winning
						literature in SL and this is my attempt to gather details on the works that have been awarded
						with
						the State Literary Award since 1959. The

						was
						founded in 1992
						by Michael Ondaatje, the internationally renowned novelist, poet and essayist of Sri Lankan
						origin.
						Funded with his Booker prize money for his novel <i>The English Patient</i>, Michael Ondaatje’s
						vision
						was to
						establish a Trust that would recognize and promote creative writing in English by Sri Lankan
						authors resident
						in the country. Towards this the Gratiaen Prize, to be awarded annually, was established in
						1993.
						The Gratiaen Prize is awarded for
						the best work of creative writing in English by a Sri Lankan citizen resident in Sri Lanka.</p>
