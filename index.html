							සංක්ෂේපයක්</a> (Sri Lanka State Literary Awards: A Compendium of Award-Winning
						Publications).
						I have long observed that there is no centralized document or database of award-winning
						literature in SL and this is my attempt to gather details on the works that have been awarded
						with
						the State Literary Award since 1959. The
						page is Sinhala-only and will be initially updated with the award-winning works of

							List of Gratiaen Prize Winners & Short Listed Writers (1993-2019).</a> The Gratiaen Trust
						was
						founded in 1992
						by Michael Ondaatje, the internationally renowned novelist, poet and essayist of Sri Lankan
						origin.
						Funded with his Booker prize money for his novel <i>The English Patient</i>, Michael Ondaatje’s
						vision
						was to
						establish a Trust that would recognize and promote creative writing in English by Sri Lankan
						authors. Towards this the Gratiaen Prize, to be awarded annually, was established in
						1993 and is awarded for
						the best work of creative writing in English by a Sri Lankan citizen resident in Sri Lanka.</p>

							The University Teachers for Human Rights (Jaffna), Sri Lanka</a> played a pivotal role in
						disseminating
						information impartially during the LTTE's struggle for a separate state from 1970's to 2009. Drs. Rajan
						Hoole, K. Sritharan,
						D. Somasundaram and Rajani Thiranagama (assasinated in September 1989) of UTHR(J) published
						a seminal work on the
						conflict, titled <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13187010/" target="_blank">"The Broken Palmyrah"</a> in 1988-1992, which is now out of print and can be found online at
						the UTHR(J) website. The Social Scientist's Asscociation of Sri Lanka
						has made available a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ssalanka/photos/a.1437400479884470/2618555891768917/?type=3&theater" target="_blank">Sinhala translation (“බිදුණු තල් රුක”)</a> 
						of the work, which is currently the only way of obtaining a print copy. The website contains an (incomplete)
						transcription of Dr. Hoole's book <a href="./mirrors/uthr.org/picutres/AOFP-COV-copy.gif" target="_blank">"SRI LANKA:THE ARROGANCE OF POWER: Myths, Decadence & Murder"</a> as well.</p>
